61505,A Little History of the World,David,865,1268,2,"January 31, 2009","I can't bring myself to jump on the warm and fuzzy bandwagon of approval of this deeply flawed book. It is what it is - a condensation of all of human history into sequential ""stories"" suitable for ""children"". Supposing for the moment that this is not an inherent recipe for disaster, what is baffling is the number of reviewers who claim to see something in this work ""for adults"". Other reviewers seem to agree on the book's ""lack of condescension"", so I guess I'll have to chalk my own perception of Gombrich's condescending tone up to an inability to put myself in the shoes of a 10-year old. So I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that point.(ON EDIT: hell, no I won't; I found him condescending as all get out) What I can't forgive him is the utterly Eurocentric, theistic worldview that permeates every page of this book. Oh sure, Buddha and Confucius get a token few pages, Islam gets its chapter. A typical excerpt: ""I am especially grateful to the Arabs.... for the wonderful tales they used to tell... which you can read in 1,001 Nights."" To be fair, he does give the Arabs credit for development of our modern number system, though he somewhat spoils the effect by continuing ""Perhaps it's just as well that Charles Martel defeated the Arabs in 732"".And so it goes. Want to know what happened to the native peoples of the Americas? ""There (in Mexico) and in other parts of America, the Spaniards proceeded to exterminate the ancient, cultivated Indian peoples in the most horrendous way. This chapter in the history of mankind is so appalling and so shameful to us Europeans that I would rather not say anything more about it"". So, not a mention of the human toll associated with Manifest Destiny (sorry, Plains Indians!); for the colonial depredations in Africa, just one sentence: ""as you can imagine, the native inhabitants were often very badly treated if any of them tried shooting at the invading troops with their bows and arrows"". Is this dude for real? I think there's a whole lot of Congolese (to mention just one example) who had their hands chopped off for ""infractions"" considerably less severe than shooting at their colonial invaders with bows and arrows. I suppose European behavior in Africa was just so shameful, best just not to mention it. Wouldn't want to upset the kids. For all I know, kids may lap this kind of thing up. But I doubt it. If this enormously biased, sanitized, middle Eurocentric view of history were all they were to be exposed to, the world would be in a sorry state indeed. ",141,21
61505,A Little History of the World,Whitaker,294,493,5,"July 19, 2020","Even if everything else in this book had been badly written (which is not the case), for this comment alone this book deserves very single one of the five stars I gave it: And when, in 1918, America's President Wilson announced that he wanted a just peace in which each nation would determine its own fate, many of their troops gave up....Then, having understood from President Wilson that there was to be a peace treaty, and that negotiations were to be held in the ancient royal palaces of Versailles, St Germain and the Trianon, Austria, Hungary and Germany sent envoys to Paris, only to discover that they were excluded from these negotiations....So this was how President Wilson kept his promises. (What you have just read is what I believed to be true when I wrote this account, but read my explanation in the final chapter of this book.)...The role played by America's President Wilson was not at all what I had imagined. I described a situation in which Wilson made promises to the Germans and Austrians which he failed to keep. I firmly believed that what I remembered had to be right -- after all, it was part of my own experience -- and when I wrote about it later I just wrote down what everyone believed. But I should have checked my facts, as all historians must be especially careful to do. To cut a long story short, President Wilson did indeed make a peace offer early in 1918, but because Germany and Austria and their allies were still hoping to win the war, they ignored it. Only when the war had dragged on for ten more months, and they had been defeated with very heavy losses, were they prepared to accept the President's proposal. But by then it was too late. Gombrich first wrote this book in Germany in 1935. The edition I read was the English edition revised and prepared by Gombrich sometime between 1990 and 2005. He could easily have simply revised the first paragraph but he kept it the way it was first written, both preserving and admitting his mistake. Written primarily for schoolchildren, I think these two passages teach kids the most important lesson about history and about life: Check your facts and if you got it wrong, revise your beliefs and don't be afraid to admit it. In this day and age of truthiness, I think this one lesson is worth Glenn Beck’s weight in gold. On to the meat of the book... As the first quoted passage itself demonstrates, calling this book A Little History of the World is probably a little fanciful. It would be more accurate if it came with a subtitle: ""As written by a German as a textbook for German schoolchildren"". The viewpoint is European; more accurately, it is of a German addressing German children. So, European and Germanic affairs occupy a somewhat more central place in the book than the title itself would suggest. For example, he spends five pages talking about Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, ruler of Germany and Italy in the 13th century. This takes up more than half of one entire chapter (his chapters are very short), of which there are a total of 40 in the book. On the other hand, the Babylonian captivity merits barely a paragraph, and the Hundred Years War is dealt with in one-and-a-half pages. England's King Henry II and Eleanor of Acquitane, who arguably had a far greater impact on European history than 'ole Frederick, are not even mentioned.Is it a great history book for kids? I think it's perfectly decent introduction as long as you bear in mind its bias and viewpoint. It covers a large swath of human history in a fairly lively way for young children.* Adults might find the brevity and lightness of treatment either somewhat condescending or irritating, but then they are not the intended audience. To criticise it as such would be like criticising Sponge Bob Square Pants for being jejeune. That's true, but also somewhat besides the point. It was a fun read for me and I liked how this condensed approach allowed me to get an easy-to-read bird’s eye view of critical historical points and how they linked up with each other. More scholarly or adult oriented histories are best, but they can be heavy-going and the mass of detail can be hard to handle. So, those looking for a history of the world should really look elsewhere. If anyone knows of a single easy-reading book that covers the various sections of the world in equal measure throughout, I’d be thrilled to know about it. It does seem to be a book that is missing in the market though. * A few GRs have criticised this book for not acknowledging more fully and in greater detail the suffering of native peoples in the Americas and other colonised lands. For example, he deals with the record of the Spanish in South America simply by stating, “…the Spaniards proceeded to exterminate the ancient, cultivated Indian peoples in the most horrendous way.” To be fair to Gombrich, it should be noted that he deals as sparsely (if not more so) with the Holocaust. As a Jew who escaped Germany before the worst arrived, he had all the reason in the world to play up this episode, but he doesn't. So if he glosses over this, his treatment of the history of Amerindians and black slavery is not likely to be due to some innate prejudice. In fact, he does expressly explain that as the book was directed at children, he felt it was inappropriate to dwell too much on such events. One can disagree with his judgement call, but his reason for it is reasonable. ",66,5
61505,A Little History of the World,Roya,281,327,4,"August 29, 2015","One of the few non-fictions I didn't want to stop reading, like, ever. I also desperately wish he was my grandpa.",33,3
61505,A Little History of the World,Jennifer,"1,721",6661,4,"August 5, 2018","I have always enjoyed reading books along with my son. He enjoyed the adult attention that came with buddy-reading when he was little, but now that we're in the teen years the motives seemed to have reversed. He humors me these days, thus the tradition of the annual summer read-along continues. Thank you, son. A Little History of the World by E.H. Gombrich was on his list for required summer reading this year (2018), so I picked up a copy as well and we went at it. He loves history, and as such, I think he wanted a bit more from this book. For me, it was a great refresher of a wide variety of well-known leaders and events, and I loved how the author (who lived through both world wars) inserted his own thoughts and personal observations into sections. Austrian born, Gombrich originally wrote this debut in his native German language and translated it himself years later. He also edited it for accuracy but kept the original text to show how views on history can shift or be mistaken. Note: I trashed the remainder of my intended review as I later stumbled across a review by Whitaker who had previously shared my exact thoughts on this reading experience (and communicated them far better than I ever could). See Whitaker's review HERE. Keeping in mind this book was originally intended as an introduction to history written for younger readers in Europe, I would recommend it. I enjoyed the writing style, the content, and the personal contributions. My son is reading it for a comparative government class and I can absolutely see why it was selected. Leadership and what that looks like has evolved so much over time. Through war and peace and selfishness to protectiveness, we learn from history: what worked and what didn't. I'm looking forward to seeing what other history assignments of substance walk through our door.",30,2
61505,A Little History of the World,Martin von Haller Groenbaek,80,26,4,"June 2, 2011","A fantastic tour de force of the history of the world in less than 300 pages. The book is intended for young readers - between 12 and 16 I would mean but is also enjoyable for the older reader - like myself - as a brief overview of what has happened on our planet from prehistoric times until the fall of the Berlin wall. The history is however - as should be expected - very Europe-centric. If I ever get the chance, it would be so interesting - at least to me - to read this book with one of my kids when they have the relevant age and to look at the places we visit from the books perspective!

61505,A Little History of the World,Andrew Smith,"1,016",551,3,"June 18, 2022","Written for children by an Austrian-born historian in 1935, this book was subsequently updated in the 1980’s. It tells the history of man since the Neolithic Age, when humans humans first inhabited this planet. There’s a brief section on the subsequent evolution of our species before the author embarks on a journey through the ages. The length of the book (I listened to an audio version of some 9 hours) dictates that it’s something of a whistle stop tour.A few things to note:1.	Previous histories I’ve come across have been written by British or American historians – this telling focuses more on central European history than others (there’s actually relatively little here on Britain), with particular focus on Germany. I don’t mean this as a criticism, and in fact it opened my eyes to events of which I’d been previously been unaware. 2.	There is a lot of focus on wars. I’d go as far as to say that the book is dominated by the various conflicts that have drawn and re-drawn the borders of the world. 3.	Oddly, very little here on science, technology, art and religion.I prefer the style over the substance here, though I do think this is an engaging introduction to history for children. If nothing else, it’ll enlighten them as to the perils of conflict and war – something we could well do with less of in our future than in our past.",19,2
61505,A Little History of the World,Lyn Elliott,669,172,4,"July 21, 2016","All the histories I read in school were based on an English world view - and yes it was English, because the Scots, Irish and Welsh barely got a look in except as being a nuisance needing to be put down. They certainly didn't give any idea about European history, as the island viewpoint prevailed (still does, it seems, after the Brexit vote).So reading Ernst Gombrich's Little History has been a delight. Lucky children to have this as an introduction to history. Of course the central viewpoint is Germany and the German speaking world, but it ranges far afield, to China and the Americas for instance. It's extraordinary that Gombrich wrote it in only 6 weeks not long after he had finished his doctoral dissertation on art history, where he was to make his reputation as a brilliant scholar and communicator. Here he showed he could link big ideas together and explain them fairly simply- what economic crisis means, the German and Italian battle for colonies in the late nineteenth century (new nations pushing and shoving to join the other imperial powers) - and gives snapshots of how rich and poor people lived at different stages, their clothes, their work and their dwellings. There were many occasions when I twitched at the way something was portrayed -the French Revolution for instance - but in the scheme of things I'm not sure how much this matters now. If you want accurate detail, you need to look elsewhere. Its strengths are in the range of geographical focus; the pressure points of war, revolution and famine; flows of social and political change and the sweep of ideas and the presence of art and design as part of life, which doesn't usually appear in general history books . The writing is lively, the voice that of a storyteller.The first edition, in German, was published in 1936, the second German edition not till the 1990s and the first English translation with a when it was relaunched with some revisions and a final chapter in which Gombrich looks back over events in his own life. Here he corrects his earlier interpretation of the American role in the Versailles Treaty that ended WWI, using his own error in interpretation as a example of why it's important that historians always check their facts. Here too he expresses his dismay at the intolerances and cruelties that marked the twentieth century and restates his 1936 expression of hope that things will be brighter in the future.The first English translation appeared only in 2005, with a preface by his granddaughter Leonie Gombrich and wonderful line illustrations by Clifford Harper.",19,3
61505,A Little History of the World,Scarlett Readz and Runz....Through Novel Time & Distance,447,333,3,"May 18, 2020","Sir Ernst Hans Josef Gombrich was mainly known by his work ""The Story of Art"" which happens to be the book of his that fell into my lap first, though ""A Little History of The World"" was actually an earlier written work of his that was published way later in his life. What attracted me to this novel was my search in finding something (a few years back) that could present an overview of world history in a fairly short storytelling format for a younger audience with just a little bit of grit that would invite more questions into the subject matter and focus mainly on the Euroasian continents. I believe this book is available online in the audiobook format, and years ago it was my first introduction to this book before I had a physical copy in hand. I'm not certain if it was narrated by Sir Gombrich himself, but I do remember that it starts off very captivating for young listeners, hence why I bought the novel sometime later. There are a few things that might be noteworthy when thinking of giving this novel a try. For one, it is almost 100 years old. Sir Gombrich was 26 years old, of Austrian descent, with a Jewish family background when he wrote his novel in 6 weeks. It published with the title: 'Eine kurze Weltgeschichte fuer junge Leser' in 1935 and became an immediate success but also a banned book by the Nazis in the following years. Another more obvious detail is that it isn't told from the perspective of any victors in history but heavily reflects on the humanity of the people living through it all. The novel is divided into 40 chapters after a short preface from the author's granddaughter and there are small black and white artful illustrations at each chapter beginning. On the sleeve of the novel is a picture of the author reading this novel to his grandchildren perched on his lap. A Little History of the World reads like a story should be told with the innocence in language of an older time. Though the novel has been revised and translated into English after Gombrich had moved to London right before WWII, it reminds me of books I was read to as a child in structure and style. Because this is an older text and there are things that the author could not possibly have known at the time, it lead to great discussions with my younger audience when reading of the different milestones in the knowledge of things. It was also refreshing to read a take on history that wasn't from the American side of view nor had a large presence in the overall telling. Gombrich used a very fluid way of maneuvering the different times and territories with a large portion on the middle ages and the age of enlightenment. With his Austria - Hungarian heritage, he spent more time on the central focus of Germany (before it was actually Germany) in a geographical sense and the forces surrounding that entire area with all the back and forth of events. This is what I wanted to hear and read about. It's not all about just dates and names and always the same names that pop up. Gombrich touched on the state of the lands and its inhabitants before and after events happened to demonstrate the effects of conquest, peril, defeat or rebuild. Now, by all means, not all of history can be put into a 284-page book, but I tell you what my listeners picked up on really quickly: history repeats itself....over and over. (Some smart kids!)What am I left with at the end of the day after reading this novel? First, I did some research on the author, and though this is a highly praised book, I am also a bit baffled on how this novel came to be and why. None of this makes it any less or more than it is. With Sir Gombrich's background in the arts and art history, it seems a fair jump to write a book as such and I feel enlightened about reading it. My take away would be that I am humbled by the author's voice in humanity and by the end of the novel, after revisions and add ons at his older age, I appreciate his point of view over the atrocities humans have committed and created and there's a bit of personal wisdom shared that moved me along the way of reading, especially a the end. Is this an in-depth history? No. Is it enough of an overview? I would say no. Can it be used as an intro to history? Yes, it could, but the audience should be upper elementary or older in my opinion. It's a great and gentle introduction from a different perspective not easily found otherwise. Perfect as additional reading or read aloud. Enjoy :) More of my reviews here:Through Novel Time & Distance",14,3

I love how everything is told like a story and how concise the book is. Even though it’s packed with information (as it should be), it was still delivered in a fun way and I found myself getting excited to know more about history. Highly recommend this!",14,2
