61834,A Night to Remember,Matt,899,27900,5,"May 7, 2020","“All the [lifeboats] together could carry 1178 people. On this Sunday night there were 2207 on board the Titanic. This mathematical discrepancy was known by none of the passengers and few of the crew, but most of them wouldn’t have cared anyhow. The Titanic was unsinkable. Everybody said so. When Mrs. Albert Caldwell was watching the deck hands carry up luggage at Southampton, she asked one of them, ‘Is this ship really unsinkable?’ ‘Yes, lady,’ he answered. ‘God himself could not sink this ship.’”-	Walter Lord, A Night to Remember James Cameron ruined the Titanic. Don’t get me wrong. It’s a near-great movie that – leaving aside the tired, mismatched love-story, and the atrocious dialogue – has one of the five-best set-piece action sequences in the long history of Hollywood. Still, the movie ruined Titanic, at least for those who already loved her. Sure, it was nice having the beautiful liner, with her sleek lines and awesome symmetry, once again dominating the world. The downside, though, was steep. Now, anyone who's ever been interested in the subject must contend with sideways glances from people who assume your curiosity was piqued by the teenage-catnip pairing of a young Kate Winslet and a young Leonardo DiCaprio “flying” on Titanic’s prow.Cameron’s Titanic ruled cinemas in 1997-98, breaking records and hoarding awards and filling the airwaves with Celine Dion. This came as a surprise to a lot of folks, but not those who had already been on the bandwagon, who recognized that the sinking of the Titanic is a near-perfect story of an incredibly imperfect voyage. Certainly, Walter Lord would not have been surprised. Back in 1955, when A Night to Remember was first published, Titanic’s fame had ebbed a bit. This tends to happen after a world war, a depression, and a second, bigger world war has killed, wounded, or dislocated tens of millions of people. Indeed, when Lord started corresponding with Titanic survivors, many of them expressed skepticism that anyone still cared. People did. People cared a great deal.Lord described himself in his own words as a writer of “living history.” He was an anecdotal historian who approached great big sweeping events through the perspectives of the individuals who lived them. Lord used the memories, experiences, and words of various eyewitnesses to tell his story. During his career, he effectively utilized this technique across a variety of subjects, including Pearl Harbor, the battle of Midway, and the siege of the Alamo, but never so effectively as in his certifiably-classic telling of the sinking of the R.M.S. Titanic. Lord's style is encompassed in the first two paragraphs:High in the crow's nest of the New White Star Liner Titanic, Lookout Frederick Fleet peered into a dazzling night. It was calm, clear and bitterly cold. There was no moon, but the cloudless sky blazed with stars. The Atlantic was like polished plate glass; people later said they had never seen it so smooth.This was the fifth night of the Titanic's maiden voyage to New York, and it was already clear that she was not only the largest but also the most glamorous ship in the world. Even the passengers' dogs were glamorous. John Jacob Astor had along his Airedale Kitty. Henry Sleeper Harper, of the publishing family, had his prize Pekingese Sun Yat-sen...Right away, you can see the amazing storytelling structure that Lord employs. He starts in the crow's nest, moments before the collision with the iceberg. He identifies one of his main characters, Fred Fleet, and then segues into a short riff on First Class pets. In a subsequent paragraph, Lord circles back to Fleet spotting the iceberg. Fleet warns the bridge and a tense 37 seconds elapse before the ship strikes the berg on its port side. At this point, Lord's tale starts to flower and expand. He leaves Fleet and the crow's nest to tell the stories of other people on different parts of the ship: a quartermaster on the aft docking bridge; a steward in First Class; a night baker baking rolls; passengers from all three classes. Lord doesn't employ a straight, linear narrative. Rather, A Night to Remember resembles a mosaic. An overarching picture of the tragedy is created out of dozens of individual accounts. Lord's genius is in weaving all these strands into a cohesive whole. He has a keen eye for dramatic moments and telling quotes. When he describes the ship's break-up, he does so by listing and contrasting all the different items breaking loose and crashing together, from the 29 boilers to a jeweled copy of the Rubaiyat, from 30,000 eggs to “a little mantel clock in B-38.” Lord is also a strong writer, which allows him to maintain the integrity of the personal observations of the survivors, while still delivering an exciting narrative. (It should be noted that Lord interviewed 63 survivors for A Night to Remember, and his letters with these men and women have become an important source for later Titanic historians). Down, down dipped the Titanic's bow, and her stern swung slowly up. She seemed to be moving forward too. It was this motion which generated the wave that hit Daly, Brown, and dozens of others as it rolled aft...Lightoller watched the wave from the roof of the officer's quarters. He saw the crowds retreating up the deck ahead of it. He saw the nimbler ones keep clear, the slower ones overtaken and engulfed. He knew this kind of retreat just prolonged the agony. He turned and, facing the bow, dived in...A Night to Remember is novelistic in its presentation, eschewing analysis and debate. For instance, rather than engage in a discussion about the band's final song, Lord simply chooses the Episcopal hymn Autumn, instead of Nearer My God To Thee. If you desire to know why Lord made that choice, you can read his follow up The Night Lives On, which is an in-depth treatment of a number of fascinating (if ultimately meaningless) questions (including First Officer William Murdoch's alleged suicide, an event blithely passed off as gospel in Cameron's Titanic, much to the chagrin of Murdoch's surviving relatives). I was five years old when Titanic was discovered, and probably ten when I read this book for the first time. Back then, the story of Titanic had real magic. Yes, it is human tragedy first and foremost; but it is also tragedy in the dramatic sense: the noblesse oblige of “women and children first;” Guggenheim dressing in his best to “die as a gentleman;” Ida Strauss refusing to leave her husband, who was not allowed in a lifeboat; the death of a titan set to music, and rockets, and finally the screams of fifteen-hundred people dropped into a freezing sea. Today, the only time Titanic is mentioned is when some new book or documentary tries to use cutting edge science to highlight some trivial new piece of evidence that is then blown out of all proportion. That is to be expected, I suppose. Even as the Titanic’s hulk rusts away on the Atlantic seabed, there are those looking to squeeze a few more bucks from her memory. Still, the endless slicing and dicing, the extreme forensic examinations, the listing of minutiae, cause me to forget why I gravitated towards the Titanic in the first place. Lord tells the Titanic story the way I hope it happened, and the way that the survivors remembered it. Knowing what we do about witness perception, and the tendency to embellish, Lord might have been a bit more critical of his interviewees. I mean, did Guggenheim really take the time to change into his dinner jacket before drowning? Did Captain Smith really step off the plunging bow and swim off into the night? No one can say for certain, yet some of these stories just sound too good to be true. They sound like bad fiction, rather than good history On the other hand, a lot of the witnesses turned out to be pretty darn perceptive. The great mystery that Ballard solved in 1985 was that Titanic had broken in two. Of course, young Jack Thayer had already said that, seventy-three years earlier, because it had happened fifty-yards from his seventeen year-old eyes. While the story of the Titanic has moved on, it has not entirely left A Night to Remember behind. It is, despite its minor flaws, still the best single book on the Titanic. Based on Lord's closeness to the actual participants – as well as his enormous talent – it will likely always retain that position.",156,10
61834,A Night to Remember,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",932,17600,5,"November 7, 2022","I think this is the last book I read before the onset of puberty. I was 12.It’s for sure it came from my Mom’s library, too…You see, back in 1962 the Township employed me as a Page there (do I hear muted whispers backstage, of Nepotism?) That was a fact of life in the big fat Police Village of City View, guys - but who loves y’a, baby?Anyway, this book of course is now eclipsed by Céline Dion singing My Heart Will Go On while standing bravely on the Titanic’s prow in our Collective Unconscious.Cause that’s the subject of the book - Titanic.Well, Heaven knows how many bold ‘n brave corrections to Lord’s summary our recent history has now washed up on the Beach of Historicism! For a while there, I thought I would actually OD on them…Or even lose my Lunch over Some of them.Oh, that garish overkill of Hollywood media! Who loves y’a, baby? Not us. Not me, anyway… No, I’ll stick with my books. “Is this the real life - is it just fantasy? Lost in a landslide, no escape from Reality!”Queen was right.Just like nepotism, Hollywood rules.",86,11
61834,A Night to Remember,Diane,"1,079",2605,5,"June 13, 2016","Wow, I can see why this book is considered a classic in narrative nonfiction. In fact, I picked up this book because Nathaniel Philbrick, himself a master writer, told the New York Times that this was one of his favorite books of the genre. (The other nonfiction book he mentioned was Alfred Lansing's Endurance, which I also agree was excellent.)A Night to Remember gives a gripping, detailed account of what happened the night the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the Atlantic Ocean, killing more than 1,500 people. Originally published in 1955, Walter Lord had interviewed survivors and reviewed documents to create this incredible narrative of the events surrounding April 15, 1912. I also liked the context Lord gave to the tragedy:Overriding everything else, the Titanic also marked the end of a general feeling of confidence. Until then men felt they had found the answer to a steady, orderly, civilized life. For 100 years the Western world had been at peace.* For 100 years technology had steadily improved. For 100 years the benefits of peace and industry seemed to be filtering satisfactorily through society. In retrospect, there may seem less grounds for confidence, but at the time most articulate people felt life was all right.The Titanic woke them up. Never again would they be quite so sure of themselves. In technology especially, the disaster was a terrible blow. Here was the ""unsinkable ship"" — perhaps man's greatest engineering achievement — going down the first time it sailed.But it went beyond that. If this supreme achievement was so terribly fragile, what about everything else? If wealth meant so little on this cold April night, did it mean so much the rest of the year? Scores of ministers preached that the Titanic was a heaven-sent lesson to awaken people from their complacency, to punish them for a top-heavy faith in material progress. If it was a lesson, it worked — people have never been sure of anything since.*I think Mr. Lord has overlooked a few dozen wars in this eloquent-and-yet-untrue sentence, including the American Civil War, the Napoleonic wars, and innumerable conflicts involving the British Empire. Other than that, this passage is great.I listened to this book on audio and was so engrossed I finished it in one session. Highly recommended.Favorite Quote""What troubled people especially was not just the tragedy — or even its needlessness — but the element of fate in it all. If the Titanic had heeded any of the six ice messages on Sunday ... if ice conditions had been normal ... if the night had been rough or moonlit ... if she had seen the berg 15 seconds sooner — or 15 seconds later ... if she had hit the ice any other way ... if her watertight bulkheads had been one deck higher ... if she had carried enough boats ... if the Californian had only come ... Had any one of those 'ifs' turned out right, every life might have been saved. But they all went against her — a classic Greek tragedy.""",82,14
61834,A Night to Remember,Matthew,"1,219",8681,5,"May 27, 2021","It is difficult to exist without knowing at least something about the Titanic. From just general fascination about a famous historical tragedy to pop culture interest around the late 90s film, you will be hard pressed to find someone who does not least have enough knowledge about the Titanic disaster to carry on a discussion about the topic. Despite what I know already, I wanted to take the time to go back and read the first (and maybe most famous) non-fiction account of the tragedy. It was 100% worth my time!I have had this book on my list for a while but was recently inspired to read it after reading The Wreck of the Titan. Titan was a book written several years before the Titanic and has the reputation of being eerily predictive of the real-life event. In my opinion, I found it lacking and wanted to cleanse my palate with an account of the true story. Lord does a great job of concisely describing the events of that fateful night. It was easy to follow and stay interested in. Sometimes non-fiction can get long winded and repetitive, but this account gets to the point with the details and brings the suspense of the real event to the page. Also found here in more detail than I have seen in other accounts (fiction and non-fiction) is the human response of the people; from heroes to cowards, split second decisions that both saved lives and cost lives, all of it extremely fascinating!If you have any interest in the event surrounding the Titanic, I highly recommend this title. I also recommend it to fans of maritime stories and important historical events in general. ",41,3

61834,A Night to Remember,Lobstergirl,"1,682",1218,3,"May 30, 2010","James Cameron's vision of the Titanic decided that the most compelling and lucrative story would focus on two young lovers who had just met. Looking at the passenger manifest, where survivors are listed in italics and the dead are not, suggests how blandly offensive this vision is. It's hard to argue with the chivalry of ""women and children first,"" but for family after family, particularly among first class passengers, fathers and husbands went down with the ship while mothers, wives, and kiddies (and often the female servants of the very wealthy) rowed away in lifeboats. Arthur Ryerson, scion of the steel and iron family, took off his lifebelt when he saw that his wife's maid, Victorine, didn't have one. Ryerson, his wife, and three of their children were returning from France to the U.S. for the funeral of his son, who had been thrown from a car the week before. Ryerson Senior perished. John Jacob Astor asked if he could accompany his wife, who was pregnant, into a boat; request denied. She and her maid survived; Astor and his manservant died. A strange calm descended over the doomed elite: Benjamin Guggenheim and his valet changed into their evening clothes so they could ""go down like gentlemen."" Mrs. Isador Straus refused to leave her husband (the founder of Macy's) and they watched the hubbub, arms entwined, as in another part of the ship steerage passengers, many of whom didn't speak English, clutched rosaries and prayed. But character was not uniformly spread amongst the nobility. As the ship disappeared beneath the waves, Lady Cosmo Duff Gordon in Lifeboat 1 remarked to her secretary: ""There is your beautiful nightdress gone.""Lord engagingly writes of these swells:There was a wonderful intimacy about this little world of the Edwardian rich. There was no flicker of surprise when they bumped into each other, whether at the Pyramids (a great favorite), the Cowes regatta, or the springs at Baden-Baden. They seemed to get the same ideas at the same time, and one of these ideas was to make the maiden voyage of the largest ship in the world.The sinking of the Titanic marked the end of an era in many ways, Lord argues, fairly convincingly. The American aristocracy ceased being noble and became merely wealthy. The sense of noblesse oblige went. People continued to make fortunes, but the war and the income tax bit into the unrelieved joyousness of being obscenely moneyed. ""Men would go on being brave, but never again would they be brave in quite the same way."" ",23,3
61834,A Night to Remember,Roman Clodia,"2,357",2285,4,"December 20, 2021","This is a surprisingly short audiobook, about five hours but it's utterly compelling listening. Lord keeps it taut and clear as we switch through various povs to experience that night when the 'unsinkable' Titanic went down. Issues of class are lightly touched upon and I was somewhat startled to find that Lord himself buys into the gendered values of 1912: that women and children should be saved first, that men should be stoic and self-sacrificing with a stiff upper lip, and that any man who shows fear is somehow a 'coward' and failing in masculinity. It's hard reading/listening to this now not to have more sympathy for people showing fear and desperation in the face of almost certain and terrifying death by drowning.Alongside this, the sheer hubris surrounding the Titanic is extraordinary - not just the asking-for-trouble 'unsinkable' label but the way in which it was blithely accepted that crossing the Atlantic without adequate life-belts and life rafts was totally fine - we might all joke about the burdens of Health & Safety in the workplace but there's clearly a reason for it!I was also taken aback at the way trained seamen reacted so differently once the ship had sunk - most steered their lifeboats away from possible survivors in the sea, only a few went searching for swimmers who were still alive. Some of this was down to the Society women who urged the lifeboats away so that they wouldn't be overcome by desperate survivors - but that seamen should subscribe to this seems extraordinary. And, finally, it's incredible that ships' systems seemed unable to pick up icebergs - not just in the case of the Titanic, but also from one of the rescue ships which navigates a field of icebergs through pure luck - now, it seems, icebergs are mapped. So a gripping and eye-opening read/listen with haunting evocations of separations and loss - very well read by Martin Jarvis with great clarity and without over-emoting.",22,9
61834,A Night to Remember,Kevin,462,68,5,"May 12, 2022","“Brilliantly lit from stem to stern, she looked like a sagging birthday cake.”With all due respect to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, my infatuation with RMS Titanic begins and ends with Walter Lord. Written some forty three years after the infamous disaster, Lord’s accounting is thorough and (no pun intended) deeply engaging. I was struck by the appalling level of class favoritism when it came time for Titanic’s compliment of 2,229 to abandon ship. The chivalrous cry of “Women and children first!” held true only if you were rich and affluent. Of the 54 children that perished, 53 were steerage passengers. Lord points out that, statistically speaking, a man with a first or second class ticket had a better chance of survival than an infant with a third class berth.As heartbreaking as this book was, I found I couldn’t put it down. I even read all the endnotes and acknowledgments—something I very rarely do. I just didn’t want to let it go. 5 stars.",22,2
61834,A Night to Remember,Juli,"1,844",470,5,"September 1, 2020","Today's cruise ships are basically floating cities. Able to carry more than 6000 people, the Oasis of the Seas (Royal Caribbean Line) is 5 times the size of the Titanic. But back in its day, more than 100 years ago, the Titanic was a wonder. It took thousands of men more than 2 years to build her. Titanic was 4 city blocks long and could carry more than 2,400 people. She was new....she was massive....and she was doomed. 2 years to build.....and the largest ship afloat in April 1912 took just under 3 hours to sink. Walter Lord tells the story of one of the most famous ocean disasters from before the ship struck an iceberg to the aftermath of the sinking. Walter Lord interviewed more than 60 survivors of the disaster to write the book. A Night to Remember was an instant bestseller in 1955. A film version was released in 1958. Lord even consulted on the filming of the 1997 movie Titanic.  I'm not sure why the fate of the Titanic is such a compelling story. It might be the huge loss of lives, the loss of such a grand ship on its first voyage, passengers with such disparate lives all doomed to the same fate....or a combination of all of it. First Class passenger John Jacob Astor, one of the wealthiest men in the world in 1912, drowned in the Atlantic alongside poor immigrants from steerage. It hits home when you compare ticket prices in today's money....those who paid the equivalent of $50,000 for a first class passage died alongside those who struggled to raise the $460 for a steerage ticket. Lord hits home with the difference in treatment of the classes on board when he points out that only one first class child died....but 52 children from steerage perished. Some passengers in steerage never even made it up to the boat deck for a chance of a seat in a lifeboat. I'm sure it's his interviews with so many survivors that makes this book so realistic. His descriptions are vivid and made me feel like I was almost there. I listened to the audio version of this book. A combination of Lord's story-telling and Fred Williams excellent narration kept me engrossed in the story from start to finish. I have read many many books on the Titanic, watched movies, listened to podcasts....for me, it's a story I just seem obsessed with. It's horrific...and mesmerizing at the same time. Lord makes the story about the people....not just the event. He tells the story of an Italian woman crying for her children on board the Carpathia, only to be reunited with them both; the first class passenger who refused to leave her Great Dane on board the ship so perished with her dog; and the stunned silence of the women in the lifeboats as they realized they had just witnessed more than 1000 people drown. It's about more than a luxurious boat that didn't survive its first Atlantic crossing.....it's about the loss of more than 1,500 people and the story of the last 3 hours of their lives. Great book! The audio (Blackstone) is just shy of 5 1/2 hours long. Fred Williams does a great job of narrating. He reads at a steady pace and has a nice voice. Very entertaining listening experience. Walter Lord also wrote books about Dunkirk and the attack on Pearl Harbor. I've got both on my TBR list now!",20,3

Written in 1955, Walter Lord, interviewed many of the survivors and pieced together a minute by minute re-telling of what happened that fateful night. Read the book and watch the wonderful movie, it’s much better than the modern telling where Rose murders Jack because she wouldn’t scooch over and let him climb up on the big door and float to safety. 😏",17,1 comment
61834,A Night to Remember,Bill,876,157,5,"November 27, 2016","A truely matter of fact account of the sinking of the Titanic, brilliantly told.

61834,A Night to Remember,Darya Silman,234,65,3,"September 7, 2022","In his book A Night to Remember, Walter Lord presented the Titanic disaster from the passengers and crew's viewpoints. Written in 1955 and partially based on interviews with survivors and families of the deceased, the book contradicts the standard narrative formed by the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Captain's suicide and the main heroine floating on the door, a vengeful husband and steerage passengers who craved to sneak into the first class - all were added for the dramatic effect. Those who read more or less about the disaster will find nothing ground-shakingly new in the book except for the single stories of individual passengers. Yet, as one of the earliest records, A Night to Remember is a brilliant example of ground-level research. The author managed to convey the sharp contrast between the initial calm - after all, Titanic was deemed unsinkable - and the panic when the realization of the danger struck people. Particular details stand out in their horror, like the vessel California being so near yet doing nothing to investigate what was going on with Titanic; or the restaurant's personnel, who, not officially belonging to the White Star Line crew, were left out for themselves. Perhaps, I became cynical after reading a lot on history, mainly about what one human being can do to another, but this book didn't touch me emotionally. I remember crying over the 'Titanic movie and the long, arduous book that covered excessively the first days after the disaster (the last third of that book was dedicated to the White Star Line's handling of the incomplete information and media coverage). Perhaps, I got lost in the vastness of personal stories where names merged into one: I'll remember the details but not the people. Or the audio version didn't play out well for me. Thus, A Night to Remember gets three stars from me as a classic. Maybe, I'll change my mind later.",15,N/A
61834,A Night to Remember,Evan,"1,072",726,4,"April 11, 2016","This is sort of the primary, classic book on the Titanic disaster. Published in 1955, it's short and smoothly written -- covering the viewpoints of a large cast and changing centers of perspective with ease. There have been four movies made about the Titanic in the sound era (there were several silent movies about or loosely based on it). I've seen three of the four and have the other one on VHS to watch. The first was a 1943 German, Nazi-produced spectacle that mainly was made, it seemed, as an anti-British propaganda piece. The special effects were so good that the ship sinking model shots were re-used in the 1958 Brit version, based on this book: ""A Night to Remember."" In the interim, Hollywood made an attempt in 1953, called simply ""Titanic,"" starring Barbara Stanwyck. For some reason, I've never found the time to watch it, even though I own it (*see 2016 addendum, bottom of review). I find it hard to imagine that it could surpass the 1958 British film: a soberly compelling version that remains my favorite. It seems most in spirit of the book.James Cameron's 1997 version is for little girls. Blah.Reading on...rating soon to come.This is a breeze to read. Very vivid, full of detail. The only thing that causes a slight slowdown is the sheer number of characters. To Lord's credit, he reminds us frequently of the positions and titles of the characters, so we don't have to go back or jog our memories trying to remember who these people are. I love when authors do that. I'm for easy. As I'm reading this I'm realizing how well the 1958 film captured this account and how badly the hokey 1997 film did.FINAL:Enjoyed this greatly. I especially enjoyed Lord's analysis of the class snobbery and attitudes of the time that led to a higher percentage of deaths among the third-class passengers vs. the first and second classes, and the media's disinterest at the time to hearing the stories of the common people in preference to the Astors and the other robber-baron types. On the other hand, he is fair, and gives credit to almost everyone for having class and dignity. I hesitate to call Lord's treatment of the issues ""socially conscious,"" I just think he was trying to be more ""fair and balanced"" as a historian than other writers had been previously.There are probably other books that go into greater detail on certain aspects of this story, but I can't imagine there being a better entire book on the Titanic than this.--------* Addendum: 2016:In the intervening years since I wrote this review, I did end up seeing the 1953 Titanic movie, and it is an entertaining potboiler vehicle for Barbara Stanwyck, all gussied up in high-gloss duds and 20th-Century Fox production values and familial bad blood. Kind of Stella Dallas on the high seas. Barbara can suffer in mink just as well on a cruise liner as in a mansion. It's grand entertainment, but not a very good Titanic movie. ",15,4
61834,A Night to Remember,Max,337,287,5,"February 5, 2016","Lord delivers a riveting account of a tragedy that symbolized the end of an age. The Titanic, the grandest of luxury liners, heedlessly speeds forward into the night as the wealthy elite indulge. They meet their destiny in the elemental forces. The Titanic’s demise eerily foreshadows the profound changes coming as the world soon unravels in the Great War. The prevailing confidence that man can control nature and his fate is shattered. A far more uncertain world is revealed. The actions of the crew and passengers depict the extremes of human behavior. Some were gallant, some were heroes, and others were cowardly and heartless. Most of us know how the band played on, how Captain Smith went down with his ship, and how some men donned their finest to perish in style after helping women and children to the lifeboats. But very disturbing is the behavior of those fortunate enough to be in one of the sixteen lifeboats. Only one lifeboat went back to save survivors after the Titanic sank even though most had plenty of room. Outcries from the boats’ predominantly female passengers demanded that the crews not go back afraid that people struggling in the water might swamp the boats. I understand fear but I still have a difficult time understanding leaving people to die in the frigid ocean especially when they could be friends or even the women’s husbands.This is a short book and reads quickly. Lord does an excellent job of putting you there. You can feel it. He also includes interesting commentary on the contemporary newspaper accounts, many of which were racist attributing cowardly acts to blacks and Italians that were actually committed by Anglo-Saxons. Highly recommended – a big payback for a small investment of time.",15,6
