It is about being awake and in touch with what is going on here and now. When the Buddha was asked to sum up his teaching in a single word, he said, ""Awareness."" The Buddha taught how to see directly into the nature of experience. His observations and insights are plain, practical, and down-to-earth, and they deal exclusively with the present. In Buddhism Plain and Simple, Steve Hagen presents these uncluttered, original teachings in everyday, accessible language unencumbered by religious ritual, tradition, or belief.","Stephen Tokan ""Steve"" Hagen, R≈çshi, (born 1945) is the founder and head teacher of the Dharma Field Zen Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and a Dharma heir of Dainin Katagiri-roshi.He is a published author of several books on Buddhism.
