22309627,How to Love,Dr. Appu Sasidharan ,944,1881,4,"July 16, 2022","In this third book, the author teaches us the importance of loving ourselves and others. According to him, connecting to people, we love means connecting to the universe.There are a set of meditations that can be done with our partner to understand more about our love in this book.
  My favorite three lines from this book. 

   “A true partner or friend is one who encourages you to look deep inside yourself for the beauty and love you’ve been seeking.”
“Other people’s actions are the result of their own pain and not the result of any intention to hurt you.”  “The roots of a lasting relationship are mindfulness, deep listening and loving speech, and a strong community to support you.”  This is a must-read book if you are someone newly married or don’t know how to express love.",113,N/A

22309627,How to Love,Heidi The Reader,"1,366",1413,5,"September 4, 2019","Thich Nhat Hanh, monk and spiritual leader, has written a short series of books he calls ""Mindfulness Essentials."" This entry is all about love. You might ask yourself, what could a monk possibly know about love? Turns out, plenty.Hanh applies the mindfulness techniques he's learned over his lifetime of spiritual practice to the potentially thorny pathways of love, and the result is a gem of a read.He counsels lovers to bring happiness to each other through being present in the moment and sharing your appreciation with each other. For example, if someone is distracted or worried, Hanh says you should draw their attention to the physical beauty of the world around them. In this way, you anchor the other in the present moment and ease the suffering of their busy mind.This type of presence is a gift that you can give to anyone at anytime. And it doesn't cost anything.Hahn describes four defining traits of love as loving-kindness, joy, compassion, and equanimity. Then he examines these traits in detail so readers can ponder the mystery of love and see where, potentially, we may be falling short of these ideals.He teaches all love begins with self love and walks hand-in-hand with spiritual practice. Through deep listening and the establishment of intimacy, Hahn believes love heals through empathy and ""karuna,"" a term that describes suffering with another and then doing what you can to end that suffering.In addition, don't take the other person for granted or make assumptions about what they may need. It is only through open communication that, Hahn believes, love lives.He makes it sound so easy. I wish it was.Recommended for readers looking to learn about the spiritual side of love in a quick and easy read. Hanh doesn't waste words and I am always in awe of what teachings he has to impart.",55,6
22309627,How to Love,Sunny Yoo,31,13,5,"June 29, 2018","Thich Nhat Hanh is so wise and deep. I love how this book is broken down into multiple sections and titles, allowing readers to be mindful of what they are reading. I recommend that you buy a copy instead of borrowing one. This book is easy to navigate through and I am glad because I will be revisiting it often.Throughout the book, I was forced to reflect about my past relationships and my current relationships, both romantic and non-romantic. I started to realize the mistakes I made. The times I wasn't a good friend and lover. How my actions caused others around me to suffer. If we practice mindfulness and these teachings we can nourish and support others to bloom like flowers.",32,N/A
22309627,How to Love,K Flewelling,125,15,4,"March 9, 2021","It is difficult to review a book like this. This book is composed of sweet morsels of truth, and statements meant to ponder. It is not something that you need to read quickly -- but I did read it quickly. It brought tears to my eyes, convicted my heart, gave me practical tools and meditations to practice. But that's all it can do. It is up to the reader to be changed. Some of the sections had a powerful impact, others not as much. I imagine if I were to re-read this short book, I would be attracted to different lessons. It is a strange but good thing to feel that you are interacting with a text, not just being told what to do. If you are looking for a meditation on love, I would recommend this for your consideration. If you are struggling to love -- anyone or anything -- this text will challenge you to open your heart, and bring mindfulness to your interactions. Love begins here.",12,1 comment
22309627,How to Love,Bianca A.,214,148,2,"January 26, 2021",Typical Eastern philosophy. Makes a few good conclusions but the argumentation for them is terrible and unscientific. It kind of relies on the reader just trusting the author that what they say is true and that's that. Couldn't really get into it.,8,N/A
22309627,How to Love,Madelyn Hernández,19,42,5,"November 25, 2016","I need to practice Hugging Meditation. ""When we hug, our hearts connect and we know that we are not separate beings. Hugging with mindfulness and concentration can bring reconciliation, healing, understanding, and much happiness. The practice of mindful hugging has helped so many people to reconcile with each other -fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, friends and friends, and so many others. You may practice hugging meditation with a friend, your daughter, your father, your even with a tree.""",6,N/A

Each chapter is very short, only 1 or 2 pages followed by a small line drawing - easy to digest and meditate upon. A series of little gems.",6,N/A

22309627,How to Love,Preethi Krishnan,54,25,5,"September 5, 2020","I keep coming back to this sentence in this beautiful book. ""One of the greatest gifts we can offer people is to embody nonattachment and nonfear. This is a true teaching, more precious than money or material resources. Many of us are very afraid, and this fear distorts our lives and makes us unhappy. We cling to objects and to people like a drowning person clings to a floating log. Practicing to realize nondiscrimination, to see the interconnectedness and impermanence of all things, and to share this wisdom with others, we are giving the gift of nonfear. Everything is impermanent. This moment passes. That person walks away. Happiness is still possible.""",4,N/A

22309627,How to Love,Laura,71,25,3,"March 26, 2019","I think there was a lot of wisdom in this little book and I got a lot out of it. I have found mindfulness to be a very positive force in my life.My biggest concern is that the book didn't address clearly when compassion and deep listening cannot change or maintain a relationship if you're with an abusive partner. I also question Thich Nhat Hanh's stance that crushes and sex without commitment are going to leave you feeling empty and lonely. I think that could be the case but as a person who is very sex positive, I think lust and sexual expression need not be confined to relationships as long as there is awareness around feeling safe emotionally and physically.",3,N/A
