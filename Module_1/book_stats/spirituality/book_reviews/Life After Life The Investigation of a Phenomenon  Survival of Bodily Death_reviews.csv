59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Tharindu Dissanayake,275,458,4,"July 24, 2021","""What Is It Like To Die?""Usually, I like to do my research thoroughly, prior to buying/ reading a book, for I like to spend the little time I have for reading as effectively as possible. However, when I saw Life After Life in a bookshelf, the title was sufficient enough to make me grab a copy immediately. I'm really glad I did so. ""All the great religions of man have many truths to tell us.""""There was more we needed to know about life that I hadn't ever thought about.""As the author himself quite eloquently express during introductory chapter, the subject of Death is not the most popular subject one out there, and it's understandable why most would stay away for a myriad of reasons. But this is not a book on death. Rather, it's a book to change one's views and opinions on death and what comes after.""Human language is inadequate to express the ultimate realities directly.""I knew I would love this book right from the start, for the author had this amazing way of presenting everything using a lot of facts (as much as possible) without any conjecture. This allows readers of diverse religious/ cultural beliefs to understand the contents without feeling any discomforts. Though the book might not present a large amount of research matter, or complex theories, the examples selected by Dr. Moody are well capable of driving home the key takeaways.""The being seems to stress the importance of two things in life: Learning to love other people and acquiring knowledge.""If you ever get a change to read this book, don't miss the opportunity. Whatever your present view of Life and Death is, Life After Life will give you a lot to think about and might be able to change your life profoundly. At the risk of repeating myself - which I do each time I read a great non-fiction book - I will say, everybody should read this book, at least once.""No matter how old you are, don't stop learning. For this is a process, I gather, that goes on for eternity.""",374,32
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Mohamad Jaber,175,14,4,"March 4, 2018","I had just started my first work, I was going to continue a phD and start my own business and then it hit me, we're all going to die.I was plundering into a state of paramount depression, I found out what I was experiencing was called an existential crisis and after a week of staying at home sleeping I decided to seek truth, I prayed more sincerely than I have ever done, I prayed God (which I was questioning his existence) helps me understand and then somehow instantaneously I stumbled upon this book.I figured out there are things beyond human understanding and there are phenomena you can't explain, the signs are there you just have to search, knock and the doors will open, ask and you will be answered, but whatever you do weather you're an atheist or devoutly religious, LOVE! not just your wife/husband or girlfriend/boyfriend, love your friends your neighbours your family...In short love humanity because this is the true meaning of this life and the one after, God exists because love exists.",68,2
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Amber,101,71,5,"June 27, 2014","I first saw this book sitting on top of my apartment complex mail boxes as I was taking out the trash. the book sat there for 2 months when I finally just picked it up to investigate and as you guessed, it was Life After Life. I began reading it and within the 1st chapter was surprised how interesting it was because I do not usually read these types of books. I was 18 and called myself an athiest. Really I think I was just mad at god at the time but by the end of this book I admitted to myself I did believe in some kind higher power. This book really effected me. Now I do not go to church or read the bible but there is meaning in living and I do believe in a life after this one. Anyhoo. Great book. Even if you do not believe in this stuff, its interesting.",37,2
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Susan's Reviews,"1,039",461,5,"June 9, 2021","This was an eye-opener for me. I was exploring different belief systems at the time that I came across  Life After Life . I had been reading accounts of Edgar Cayce's life and his predictions, and I was open to the possibility of NDE's and the notion of reincarnation. I like the idea that everything has some sort of energy or spirit or personality that is not totally extinguished on the death of the vessel encapsulating it for the time being.As children, we chant the nursery rhyme: Life is but a dream... And we are told to row our boats gently but merrily down the stream of life.We may never have all the answers to the eternal question of ""why"" or ""how"" of existence. And don't worry, I don't accept everything I read as ""gospel"" truth! I study both sides of an issue, and I prefer to remain open - to everything. Life is more ""wonder-ful"" that way!",34,6
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Renee Amberg,102,6640,5,"June 27, 2018","Moody does an excellent job at explaining his research on life after life. This book was the most fascinating book I've ever read. I've watched a lot of videos on peoples experience with the after life and seeing all of them draw similar stories and experiences blew my mind. I definitely have a completely different view on death, a calm and accepting view. I highly recommend reading this book at least once in your life. There is no bias, Moody does an excellent job at sharing the stories of others as well as making solid points from a scientific stand point. 5/5",17,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Tara,31,4,4,"June 23, 2011","This is my first book that I've read about people's life after death experiences. I knew that many people had such experiences and so I looked on amazon to see if any books had been written. I was surprised to see just how many books have been written. I chose to read Life after Life because it ""investigates more than one hundred case studies of people who experienced ""clinical death"" and were subsequently revived,"" and then categorizes these people's experiences into events that the people experienced in common. I was pleasantly surprised to see that most people experience very similar events, no matter what their background. I especially enjoyed reading about ""the personage of light"" that many people encounter and the feeling of love that they feel in this person's presence. Although I've always had hope and faith in life after death, this book has increased that conviction and has taken away any fear of death that resided within my darker corners. Although the author is a professor at the University of Nevada, which should say something about his credibility, unfortunately, at the end of the book he wrote about things that lessened his credibility in my mind, such as that he has developed techniques for people to contact the dead and visit the other side, etc. I don't believe that such things can occur by man's will, only by God's. Nevertheless, I still think the book is worth reading. I look forward to comparing this to other books on life after death.",15,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Book2Dragon,330,136,4,"February 14, 2020","I read this book some time ago. I remember it as a positive early look at what happens when a person dies. Having been a nurse, the stories resonated with me. I would say Elisabeth Kubler-Ross does a more thorough job of exploring this topic, as now it is a topic that is being discussed. I think you could call Moody's work pioneering, because Death was a forbidden topic when it was published (1975)",13,2

I, personally, will be forever thankful to the nurse who refused to give up on my Momma 45 years ago, while the doctor was telling my Dad that he was sorry and they did all they could to save her, the nurse (a family friend) had stayed in the room, climbed up on the bed, straddled Momma's waist, hooked her hands together and brought them down on Momma's chest with ""everything in me"". The paddles hadn't worked but the sheer determination and love of this little nurse started her heart and brought Momma back.Of course, Momma was furious because she said ""I was in Heaven, why didn't y'all just leave me alone.""Ah, Momma, you're there now and I miss you ... every minute of every day.",9,1 comment

59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Nick Imrie,284,122,3,"January 10, 2021","I should've read this book - the first serious book on 'Near Death Experiences'; the book which coined the term - before I read all those wacky kindle unlimited books on people's fabulous adventures on the other side.First published way back in the 20th century, this book is full of extra-ordinary revelations that the author expects you to find dubious like: 'Did you know that a surprisingly large number of people have had an NDE and - get this - they all have similar experiences, like they all have the experience of travelling down a tunnel towards a white light. Isn't that crazy?'So strange to read now that 'go into the light' is a cliché.Which is to say that this is an interesting, serious, and even-handed book, but everything in it has now passed into pop culture, so there's not much new.",7,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Christian Nikitas,231,50,5,"April 10, 2021",This was such an interesting book about peoples near death experiences/out of body experiences. It's amazing how many peoples stories are similar. I highly recommend it to anyone curious about death and beyond. ,7,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Lois,310,85,5,"April 25, 2022","This book has been a great comfort to me. Last month I lost my mum to a rare and aggressive cancer just six weeks after diagnosis, and our lives have been completely turned upside-down. I’m 24, my mum had just days turned 52. Not only is she my mum, she is my best friend, and I can’t even really begin to describe that pain, the big aching hole in the middle of everything. That’s where this book really came to help me, extending a hand over the chasm. My mum and I have always been very spiritual–spiritual, not religious–believing in the soul, its existence apart from the physical body, and some place we go after our physical lives on earth. Professor Moody’s book is truly fascinating: drawing from over 500 near-death experiences (he actually coined the term) and quoting approximately 150, it indicates the stages we go through on the brink of death. No matter the cause of death (evidently before resuscitation) in the cases explored here, it’s incredible how many of the same features crop up in each testimony. Moody is careful–he’s a medical doctor and psychiatrist–to signpost his thesis with evidence, to meet any and all resistance with evidence, which I really respected and which ultimately made me feel quite at peace. I know my mum is still with me, and I know I’ll see her again. If you’ve lost anyone close to you, or are simply just interested in the topic, then I highly recommend this book.",5,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Marguerite Harden,7,4,5,"May 10, 2012","Raymond Moody-- a doctor and someone who has never had a near-death experience himself-- presents an unbiased account of years of case studies regarding trends behind what happens to some individuals after clinical death, and resuscitation thereafter. Personally, I have a science background combined with a strong faith, and this book does a great job of revealing a, ""middle way of interpreting -- a way which neither rejects these experiences on the basis that they do not constitute scientific or local proof NOR sensationalizes them by resorting to vague emotional claims that they 'prove' that there is life after death"" (p. 163). After reading this book, I have found relief and comfort in the shared experiences of death, which are described in Chapter 2. In addition, I particularly enjoyed Chapter 3, which relates the personal case studies that had been relayed to Dr. Moody to historical texts, including mainstream religions (The Bible), philosophies (Plato), and even the Tibetan Book of the Dead.This book offers a historical, and insightful relation of some modern ideas relating to death and the potential for life after death. Because this book is the first notable book about near-death experiences, there is much defense of the research that was conducted, and the questions and skepticism that arise from these conversations are well vetted. I appreciated these sections, but I'm also looking forward to reading more books on the subject that speak are aimed more at the believers than the skeptics.I would recommend this book to people of all types, including those with spiritual or religious backgrounds, and those without; those with an open mind to what happens near and after death, and especially to those who are skeptical of the idea that anything happens after death. I appreciate this dialogue and wish the topic of death was a less taboo topic in our society, as Dr. Moody points out.",4,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Benjamin Stahl,"1,780",39,4,"September 12, 2021","For about the first half of this I was not impressed at all. The book, in my judgement, plummeted right down to two stars because it was just a lot of repackaged correspondence from certain case studies, bearing little real indication of reliability. Not to be all sceptical towards a subject I in no way reject and indeed invest deep hope in, but the supposed evidence presented was nothing more than purely anecdotal. Furthermore, it wasn't even that compelling as all the stories just repeated, numerous times, the same basic events, which did not necessitate so much retelling when most people interested in this subject would have heard it all multiple times before. Simply reporting the same experiences over and over again, without much analysis, made for a hardly satisfying read. The latter half of the book is much better though. Finally, Dr. Moody goes beyond the basic reporting of personal testimonies, and actually analyses, reflects upon and explores the implications of near-death, or temporary-death experiences. He even goes a long way in linking his conclusions (speculative though they ultimately must be) to historical perspectives on the afterlife.Overall, while this book isn't necessarily the best on the subject out there - especially as it was published in the 1980s - it is a decent book, with enough of quite exceptional value, thanks largely to Moody's clarity of writing, to justify reading it if you happen upon it and are concerned or curious about what awaits us after death.I picked this up because I was going through a bit of an emotional slump, for some reason, shortly prior. As I still am sometimes, I was particularly disturbed by a sense of my own mortality, as well as my wife's, and I was profoundly upset by the fearful notion of being separated (though, God willing, only temporarily) by a fatal sickness one day in the future, which I can only hope to God will never happen, at least until we have grown old together. Since marrying my wife, and now having a child too, I have more to lose than I'd ever imagined I could, and the inevitability of death, even with my faith, is often an upsetting prospect to contemplate. To be honest, this book doesn't entirely offer a cure to such existential fears as that. While written by a Christian (Methodist, I think he said), the book does not aim to affirm any particular interpretation or religious belief of what awaits us after death. It merely puts forward the argument that we don't just cease to exist, as atheists would have you believe. You will probably take out of this book, the beliefs you held going into it. I don't imagine it will necessarily convince anyone who rejects the afterlife to do any more than briefly wonder. And it does not contradict what Christians such as myself believe, apart from a few, weird stories I think can probably just be chalked up to the experiencer being confused.",3,N/A
59598,Life After Life The Investigation of a Phenomenon  Survival of Bodily Death,Mark Maguire,190,3,4,"February 4, 2013","This was a challenging, and thought-provoking read, which posed as many questions as it attempted to answer. The primary reason for reading this book was to try and find an answer to the following question: ""can human consciousness survive bodily death""? I have been asking this question for a number of years, and I have approached a number of authority figues in relation to this question, and I all have ever received has been either obfuscation, or a guarded ""yes"", dependent upon one's conduct in the present-life. It would seem to be a remarkable, and almost inexplicable feat for consciousness to survive bodily death, but having read the cases contained within the book, the almost formulaic repsonses given by those whom have either died, or have come close to death, does make for startling reading, and has brought me a step closer to a considered answer to the question above. The key problem that the Author runs into is the problem of ""proof"". At the time of writing, it has not proven possible to provide evidence of the existence of an afterlife within the socially-accepted boundaries of modern science. The current inability to quantify the afterlife, means, in the majority of cases, that studies in this field are dubbed ""pseudo-scientific"" or as being simply delusional. The Author does try to answer a number of questions that have been raised over the years since the book's original publication, and also evidences a number of comparisons between drug-induced hallucinations; dreams, and out of body experiences, all of which seek to challenge the orthodoxy that the subjects involved can be explained either medically or by reference to religious faith. However, within the accepted norms of the day, we have no definitive proof of an Afterlife. The question and answer session does go some way to pointing to an academic rigour which is missing from most other works within the field. The highlight of the book surprisingly, resides not within the incredible personal accounts of the Afterlife, but within the chapter on psychological explanations for the aforementioned experiences, which is one of the most rigorous and thought-provoking chapters that I have read thus far. Having recently read Koestler, I certainly feel that any ""proof"" of the existence of the Afterlife resides within the critical distinction between the Brain and the Mind,and thus our understanding of the Ghost in the Machine. This was a fascinating read, and I certainly feel that I making progress with my professed aim of answering the question: ""can consciousness survive bodily death"".  ",3,N/A
