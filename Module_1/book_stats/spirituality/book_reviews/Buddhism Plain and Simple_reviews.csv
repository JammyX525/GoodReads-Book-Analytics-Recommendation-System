776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,3,"October 4, 2016","Is Buddhism really plain and simple? I think not. The more I read on Buddhism the more I find I need to read. This book has led to a spiralling off of an entire arc of spiritual texts I feel I need to get to grips with. I have loads sat on my shelf, and I have loads I need to learn. Last month I almost signed up for a Buddhist meditation class in part because of this book. It pushed me further down the road of perhaps one day living this belief system fully. Unfortunately life got in the way and I didn’t go to the group. Next year when I have more time I will actually go to it. Buddhism is more than just you and I. It is about the universe and positive energy; it is about making the most out of existence and understanding that all life is precious no matter what form: it is about peace and happiness. Wouldn’t the world be a better place if all word powers relinquished power to a ruling body of Buddhist monks? I speak of idealism, but these men understand the human mind more than most. “It’s called enlightenment. It’s nothing more or less than seeing things as they are rather than we wish or believe them to be.”",43,6
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Justin,9,3,5,"December 7, 2008","This is a favorite Buddhist book of mine. Steve Hagen keeps the subject matter extremely simple and focused on mindfulness and our misperceptions of reality. I wouldn't say this would be a very good first book to read but it should definitely be the second or third book you read as you are beginning to explore zen buddhist thought.I especially love his take on exploring the afterlife. He essentially says it doesn't matter, that it's an ancillary concern. I couldn't agree more and it was nice reading a book that doesn't feel the need to explore the unknowable in order to justify Buddhism as a complete religion.",29,7
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,aPriL does feral sometimes ,"1,844",419,4,"June 24, 2018","I highly recommend 'Buddhism Plain and Simple' to those who want a short brief explanation of the basic precepts (mind[fully] you all, these are guiding precepts only, not Commands or Rules! Commands and Rules would not be very Buddhist at all) of a very old philosophical religion (2,500 years or so). The author of this 160-page book, Steve Hagen, has stripped out all of the history, beliefs added by different cultures, ceremonies, and rituals with which the various flavors of Buddhism has accrued in its journey through Time and communities. He only discusses the basic tenets and ideas of Buddhism.For the record, I believe I have infrequently experienced a sense of my 'self' being gone, my perceptions only being activated, and I was ""seeing"" and being ""awake"", which the author says is the point of Buddhism. It happens during the first minutes of waking up from being unconscious for me. I have epilepsy. Having an epileptic 'fit' isn't hardly ever an event which happens to me anymore, especially since I figured out how to avoid epileptic 'fits' - stay hydrated, eat regularly, exercise moderately, avoid drugs and, especially, never mix alcohol and drugs. I have a single erratic brainwave apparently, or so the results of an Electroencephalograph I was forced to have after an incident in a restaurant, the fifth incident.I will describe a particular epileptic incident which represents how all such incidents felt to me, although exterior circumstances varied.Once, at a party, when I was 19 years old, I was sitting on a couch. Two of my friends at the time came up and offered me a joint. I had not much experience drinking alcohol at this point, but I had had a drink or two, here and there. I had tried pot here and there as well, but it made me feel weak, dizzy. I told my friends I thought I should not smoke a joint AND drink because I wasn't sure I could handle it. The man friend was disgruntled. Everybody else was drinking alcohol and smoking joints. There was a lot of hilarity and joking. I already had had a small drink. But there were twenty or so people there, everyone was high, having fun, so I took the joint. I remember taking three tokes....This is where I suddenly was no longer a self. I was 'seeing'. I was a streaming moment. I did not know where I was, who I was, what I was - and I did not care. I did not know I did not care, or have any worries or concerns. I remembered nothing about anything - past, present, my life. I felt marvelous, without weight. I slowly became aware I was floating in a dark blue place with a light above me, as if I was swimming underwater looking up at the sun. Then I opened my eyes, and feeling slowly came to me - awareness of my body bits, piece by piece, awareness without a single thought in my head. To this day I can vividly recall every second of that being 'awake'. I looked around, slowly recognized the living room, the fact I was on a couch - but I was blissfully at peace, weightless. For many minutes. I think. Time did not exist. Then I became aware my two friends were panicked, and while they had been talking to me, I had been not tracking what they were saying. I was still feeling weightless, which lasted a long time, actually. However my friends believed I was dead and everyone had run. The room had emptied of all the people who had been there except my two friends. Later I realized how brave this was, and why everybody else, who also were my supposed friends, had split. I was underage, I apparently had died, there were illegal drugs everywhere, the cops would arrest everyone - jail, lawyers, losing job, angry parents, etc. So they all had left me there, maybe dying, without calling for help or trying to help me. Except for these two people.Please gentle reader, take a moment to reflect on this, and on any situations similar to this which you may unthinkingly have been taking part in your own past.*Ahem*I had a couple more 'learning experiences' about my epilepsy. So, by the time I was 22 years old, I no longer did ANY drugs, and I drank alcohol in small sips. And yes, it meant I was accused of being a 'narc' at parties in the 1970's, and a party pooper by many many many many many many many many people. Btw, for those of you who, for whatever reason, feel disgruntled when people refuse to drink or do drugs - BACK OFF.*Ahem*Anyway, this state I enter whenever I inadvertently trigger an epileptic attack is evidently what the endgame of Buddhism is about, except with a lot of philosophy. And note Buddhism doesn't recognize the existance of the concept of 'endgame.' P.S. I do not recommend inducing epilepsy as a shortcut to a Buddhist peace of mind. For one thing, bruises. For another concussions from hitting sharp and hard objects when you lose consciousness. And lastly, people are terrified, not blissed out over your 'achievement'. It turns out the Body is painfully streaming in realtime, HD and ephemeral as life may be.",12,N/A
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Bill,2,1 follower,3,"October 8, 2013","This book is a good overview of the core of Buddhist thinking. It can be difficult for many Westerners to explore Buddhism because many sects are built around particular Asian cultures and philosophies. Steve Hagen distills Buddhism down to its core philosophy, making it practical and accessible for all. I still struggled with some concepts, however. For example, the concepts of constant change and elimination of the self. While I understand that nothing is static in the universe, I still find the concept of the self has a very real meaning. I don't deny that my body and mind are changing from moment to moment, but there is also significant continuity. I have trouble understanding how acknowledgment of such changes can be applied to my daily living. I do, however, understand the broader points about non-attachment, so I may be taking his words too literally. I may have to re-read some chapters.Overall I think this book is a very good primer for those interested in learning more about Buddhism.",12,N/A
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Bill,10,1 follower,2,"January 19, 2009","I return to this book every once in awhile because I will forget what I ahve learned the first time. I do not want my 'star' review to indicate that it isn't a good book. It is written with enough anecdotes and simply enough to acheive what I think the purpose is; to explain the basic tennants of Buddhism. My problem is with Buddhism as he explains it. All life is pain and we just have to learn to deal with it so we don't experience so much dissatisfaction in our life. In this reading of the book I have come to the conclusion that Buddhism is not a religion, it is a philosophy. It has very usefull componants but regardless of how much duhkha I feel in my life my experience that is that there is a lot more out there. I think that this book is a good, and quick, read but that it did not feel satidfying to me or convincing as a belief system.",11,1 comment
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Renee Amberg,102,6640,4,"January 11, 2019","The only reason I rated this a 4 rather than a 5 is because this is such a deep thought provoking book that I don't think I could truly grasp everything that this book has to offer. That said, I will definitely be rereading it again in the future to do so. There are so many deep philosophical concepts in this one. I understood a lot in the beginning but towards the end, it got a bit too deep - to the point where I was a bit confused. Something at the end that gave me a sense of understanding and pulled lots of the ideas around for me was, ""Things only exist in relation to other things, thoughts, and feelings"", which honestly, you'd have to read the book to fully understand. I feel like so many ideas where planted in my mind with this book but thats all it was. Now it's up to me to keep growing that seed and fully grasp the understanding of what it truly means. Here are a few other quotes that spoke to me on a deep level: “If only you would stop telling yourself what it is, or asking yourself what it might be, or speculating on what it might look like, it would become readily apparent.”""You are not lacking a thing. You only need to stop blocking or interpreting your vision.""""We thirst for nonexistence when we want to be released from this world of pain and vexation.""",10,N/A
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,David,227,29,5,"March 8, 2009","I received this book from a longtime family friend as a Christmas present last year, and really enjoyed it. Hagen makes mention of two other great books, Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind by Shunryu Suzuki-Roshi and Peace is Every Step by Thich Nhat Hanh. I read both of these in 2008 and agree with Hagen that they are must-reads for those interested in Buddhism or meditation.This book also falls into the must-read category, in my opinion. I have read quite a few books on the subject, but this one is unique. Hagen effectively describes Buddhist concepts, focusing more on real-world application than definitions. This makes the book easy to understand and relatable.Buddhism: Plain and Simple is broken up into three sections: I) The Perennial Problem, II) The Way to Wake Up and III) Free Mind. Each section flows into the next, the way good writing should, while also standing on it’s own. I would easily suggest this as essential Buddhist literature, or even as a meditation practice manual to my closest friends. Hagen’s humility can be found on each page, and as a reader I got the sense that he wrote the book in an effort to really reach people and help improve our current situation. After all, we’re all stuck together for the time being, so why not make the best possible world that we can? 5/5 Stars. 159 pages. Published in 1997.",9,N/A
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Nikmaack,611,17,2,"September 24, 2017","I enjoyed it at first. It was very straightforward and simply stated. Quite nice. Then it gets deeper into Buddhist teachings and starts repeating itself and getting bogged down in nonsense. I found myself less and less interested in reading. It felt like he lost the thread of his own arguments. It also gets a little condescending and pompous. And it tries to tell me what I'm supposedly feeling, which always makes me angry. Here was my breaking point:Hagen starts lecturing about how there is no self. To make some point about this, he describes a ""little boy"" who has broken his arm and is now faced with an X-ray machine. The boy flinches, scared by the machine. The technician, seeing this, says, ""It won't hurt you. It's just going to take your picture.""""We're afraid in much the same way as this little boy,"" Hagen writes. ""We don't understand consciousness, just as the little boy didn't understand the X-ray machine. Naturally we're terrified that whatever it is we're about to confront, it's going to hurt. But I'll speak the X-ray technician's part here and tell you it won't hurt.""When I reached this point in the book, I'd been skimming. When I saw this passage, I was annoyed as all hell. I'm a scared little boy, and you're going to tell me it's okay? Screw you, buddy. You're not my guru, my teacher, or my goddamn parent. For me, this moment crystalized a feeling I have with a lot of Buddhist texts.""I, who have deeply explored Buddhist doctrines, shall now impart to you my wisdom. Oh, but I will never put it that way, for we are all enlightened already. We simply need to wake up. I will never actually say that I am more awake than you, but I am writing this book after all, so I must be more awake, right? Now take my hand, little boy, and let me explain to you how there is no self.""Somehow these books never come across as an author saying, ""Here's my perspective, based on my experiences and interpretations."" Instead, there's this god awful sense that their shit does not stink.The Buddhist ego is buried in the Buddhist bullshit. Buddhists supposedly strive to be egoless, selfless, detatched little clouds of insufferable wisdom. But I always get the feeling the ego is just repressed, under the surface, and the real motivations are always just a game of who has the most dharma filled life. Which of us is wisest. The lesson about the lack of self, which pops up in a lot of Buddhist books, typically goes something like this. Hey, remember when you were six? You're not that person now. All your atoms and stuff have changed. Can you really say you're that person? Can you look at a photo of you at that age and really say, ""That's me""?Of course I'm not still that person. I have changed. But that kid is still very much a part of me. If I was around when you were six and I chopped off your little finger, you would now be whatever age you are now, and you would still be missing your little finger. That experience carries forward. And less violent and simpler experiences also carry forward in some manner. To suggest there is zero connection between who we were and who we are is insane. We get programmed by our earlier experiences. We can look at that programming, question it, recognize the programming no longer makes sense, and change the behaviour. But to simply say, I am not that person at all and I live in the now, and the future is an illusion and the past is an illusion? Utter nonsense.I guess I'm supposed to respect Hagen and his wisdom because (the back of the book tells me) he ""has studied Buddhism for thirty years, including fifteen years with Zen Master Dainin Katagiri, from whom he received Dharma Transmission (endorsement to teach).""But that insufferable tone is probably something you pick up when you've studied this stuff for 30 years. Oh, he'll tell you no book can teach you the truth, and you need to find it for yourself. But he'll also tell you the truth you're supposed to find when you finally find it. Blah.",8,2
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Morgan Blackledge,551,1851,4,"September 28, 2018","If you’re a western Buddhist, there’s a little ‘high moment’ happening right here and right now!Starting about 15 years ago, his holiness the Dali Lama (or ‘HH’ as hipster in-the-know Buddhist’s are apt to refer to him) began his now legendary ‘Mind and Life’ meetings with western psychologists and neuroscientists including; Richie Davidson, Paul Ekman, Daniel Goleman, Daniel Siegel and the likes. This, in addition to the foundational (and incredibly boring) work of Jon Kanan-Zinn, and the (spectacularly lovable but vanilla as all get out) baby boomer era Buddhist icons, Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Sharen Salzburg and (that wild thing) Pema Chodren basically launched the NüBü2 (New Wave Of Buddhism 2.0) renaissance were currently experiencing. Yeah!Anyway, the Mind and Life crowd have issued tons and tons of ‘sciencey’ books that frame Buddhist philosophy, practices and phenomena in terms of their (snap-crackle-pop) psychological constructs and neurological concomitants. This book is not (yet another) one of those. At this point we probably have enough of those. So good. NOTE: if I sound snarky about all of this, it’s just an 80’s era, insecure adolescent ‘to cool for everything and everyone’ defense mechanism that I haven’t entirely outgrown. Mea culpa. I’m actually a BIG BIG fan of the ‘Neuroscience meets Meditation’ trend. Not only is it fascinating AF to hear about how meditation changes your brain, affect, cognition and behavior.It’s also super assistive in traversing the enormous dung heap of irrelevant religious nonsense that the Buddhist, and other eastern contemplative wisdom traditions are mired in. Go ahead and hate me for saying that. But please bare in mind, that I’m a long-time practitioner, and I have extensive training and experience in Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Additionally, I have extensive training in the social sciences and I’m a working licensed therapist. If I bag on the eastern traditions, and popular psychology, it’s pretty much from an insiders perspective. I’m at least a ‘prosumer’ i.e. professional consumer of these books and ideas. So rest assured, I’m not that run of the mill, board IT guy in a gamer chat room, sub-readdit dwelling, myopic, blowhard, tiki torch, golf shirt and khakis sporting hater type. In other words, I’m not your average shitty atheist skeptic. I am a shitty atheist, but I’d like to assure y’all that I’m not one of those guys (I hope).Anyway. This is all a round about way of saying (a) there are tons of good ‘this is your brain on Buddhism’ books available, and (b) this is not one of those books.This book is good, and useful for a whole different and equally important reason. But it’s not one of those. This book is useful because it translates some of the frequently overwrought and subsequently confusing as hell Buddhist ideas into fairly down to earth, smart enough, plain ol’ English. Not as easy as it sounds, and this book does a respectable job of it.Buddhism has changed every culture it has encountered, and conversely, every culture Buddhism has encountered has changed it. Buddhism is hitting our western, materialistic, dualistic culture, and we’re hitting back, to everyone’s benefit, with some systematic, hard nosed methodological clarity. In addition to grounding Buddhist practices in a systematic, materialist, monistic framework, the west is also in the process of squaring the Buddhist world view with western philosophical traditions. For instance:Heraclitus’s doctrine of eternal change is oft summarized with the phrase; no man can step into the same stream twice, for it is not the same river and it is not the same man.This notion is frequently cited as a western philosophical analog to the Buddhist doctrine of impermanence (Anitya) which asserts that everything in existence, without exception, is transient, evanescent, inconstant and thereby fundamentally unsatisfying. In other words. The world is falling apart and it makes us all feel crappy. Cool right?Anitya (impermanence) is intimately associated with another Buddhist doctrine of Anatta (no-self) which declares that things (including you and I) have no essence, or soul or no permanent self.In other words, there is no such ting as a soul, and that self ‘ego’ thing you’re identifying with is simply psychological smoke and mirrors. Don’t make me quote Niche. Cuz I will. Dukha (human suffering) stems from obsessively and compulsively (an necessarily unsuccessfully) trying to find lasting satisfaction in this churning, changing impermanent and illusory world/self stuff. Sartre and Camu anyone?Buddha, Dharma and Songha (roughly translated as self knowledge and mastery, effective training, and community of likeminded individuals) is our only reliable refuge in this shit storm of suffering also known as the human condition. Now we’re talkin’ Bill W (and friends) if you catch me. But please, please don’t get me started!Anyway. I don’t know about y’all, but so far, none of this is counter to my experience. And if I was religious, this would definitely be the one! This book does a nice job of expanding upon these concepts and bringing them to life in a way that won’t insult the intelligence and intellectual training of an educated contemporary western reader. However. Some of the poopy Buddhist bath water is still on this baby. Unfortunately, some of the more cherished Buddhist ideals depend on magical thinking. These are hard to discuss in this limited format, but in a nutshell, Buddhist’s frequently conflate phenomenologically derived epiphany i.e. cathartic meditation experiences, with scientific methodology and fact. In other words, they often confuse experience with experiment, and make baseless truth claims about the fundamental nature of things derived from meditation experiences that were emergent from indoctrination in the Buddhist world view to begin with. Thought Experiment: if I tell you that the universe is one big ‘conscious’ entity, and that we can merge with that ‘big universal consciousness’ by mediating, and you believe me, and then you sit down and ‘experience’ something like a non personal awareness, does this constitute proof of the initial hypothesis?Answer: no. But a-lot of Buddhists would claim yes, and even go so far as to claim this as a scientifically valid experiment. It’s not. It’s actually like, um, how do you say, ummmmm...... the opposite?It’s a valid ‘first-person’ observation, but it’s not a reliable ‘third-person’ experimentally valid, double blind, randomly assigned, placebo controlled, replicated, peer reviewed finding. No it is not! So stop. Please. It’s embarrassing. In a time when it is increasingly evident, the it’s bad news to become siloed in divisive ‘red verses blue’ world views, due to clever and well intended algorithmically derived personalized news and information feeds that ALWAYS obey your preferences, and ONLY confirm your biases.The problematic nature of an uncritical approach, to taking as fact, a quasi religious, magical truth claim, based on first-person experiential observation, of an intrinsically ambiguous phenomena, conditioned (i.e. psychologically primed) by a compelling (however nonsensical) notion, floated on top of other comparatively reasonable philosophical presuppositions, should be self evident. Just think of; every religious cult, or cockeyed, half baked, well meaning but actually disastrous political or cultural anything for examples. Any way, some of this type of nonsense is alive and kicking in this text. So buyer beware. If I were to take the middle path, I’d say I ‘like’ this book. But that would be an unsatisfying synthesis of my actual moment to moment experience of this text. 70% of the this book rocks. 25% is squishy but useful.5% is poopy effluvium (great word, look it up RN if you don’t already know it).That being said, the author seems like a mensch, and I really did enjoy this book and benefit from it immensely, and I’d say the world is a better place because of this nifty lil’ text.So bring your inner shitty, skeptical, curious, open, accepting and loving self (or no-self if you want to go there) to your one, wild, first person experience of this (largely awesome and at times sort of squishy, and at other times even a little intellectually bio-hazardous) real good read.",7,7
776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Deb Jones,681,77,4,"October 4, 2019","Author Steve Hagen explains that what he has done in the book is to strip away the arcane language that sometimes accompanies Buddhist text/thoughts and the cultural aspects of the movement to bring to the reader Buddhism in plain language. In addition, Hagen essentially boiled the meat off the bones of basic Buddhism principles to provide the reader access to the very essence of Buddhist thought.This book I borrowed from the public library, but it requires more than light reading to fully grasp and appreciate this very different way of thinking. I'm adding to my Christmas wishlist on Amazon.",7,N/A

776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Clara,335,3,2,"February 27, 2012","Buddhism Plain and Simple was, perhaps, too ""plain and simple"" for me. Not really. I just found it uninspired and uninspiring. I think I'd be a better judge of its value if it were my first or second introduction to Buddhism and I was able to approach the book with a ""beginner's mind."" Since that's not the case, if you're looking for an introduction to Buddhist thought, take my luke-warm rating with a grain of salt and decide for yourself.Hagen does do a nice job, in my view, of explaining no-self and interdependence plainly, without undue complication. There's nothing particularly wrong with the book; it's simply that there are other introductions, or books that, although not introductions per se, get the principles across in more compelling ways.",5,3

776,Buddhism Plain and Simple,Peter Neiger,92,7,5,"February 15, 2017","It is hard to me to pinpoint exactly when I started to have an interest in Buddhism. I remember learning about it in a high school religion class, but that introduction was little more than “it isn’t really a religion but it kind of is”. I was a hardcore Christian at that time and I have no doubt that I saw Buddhism as simply another Satanic ruse to steal souls from Heaven.In the decade and a half since high school, my interest in Buddhism has bubbled in my subconscious. I’ve purchased several books about it but rarely finish them. As much as I am interested in Buddhism the works I’ve read seemed unnecessarily vague and complex, I felt like the authors were playing tricks with words instead of just coming out and saying what Buddhism is.Buddhism: Plain & Simple by Steve Hagen is the opposite of that....http://peterneiger.com/buddhism-plain...",3,N/A
