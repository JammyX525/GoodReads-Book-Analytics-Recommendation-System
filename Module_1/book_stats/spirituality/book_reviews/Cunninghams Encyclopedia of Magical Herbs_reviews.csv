145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Heather Purri,37,28,5,"February 23, 2021","Difficulty Level: BeginnerNo magickal background necessary.Pros:- It's an occult/Pagan classic.I believe this book was written for Pagans in general.I know firsthand that virtually all Wiccans use this and most Hoodoo practitioners use it in conjunction with Hoodoo Herb and Root Magic by Catherine Yronwode, cross-referencing herbs between them.I highly recommend getting the ebook, so you can quickly find what you need.- Botanical names are given to each plant so that you won't confuse them with plants that have the same common name. For instance, plants that have traditionally used for witchcraft in Europe, often have ""devil's [something]"" in their common name or some similarly foreboding name to scare you off.-Written for practitioners at any level.Before you get to the encyclopedia part, it starts with an intro to magick for beginners while explaining why and how to use herbs, spices, etc.Cons:- No in-text citations. Would've been useful for the folklore entries. There's a bibliography though.- Doesn't contain medicinal qualities of plants.- Only contains botanical drawings of about half of the plants.",36,1 comment

145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Heka,29,2,3,"January 27, 2018","I had this book for years but, unfortunately, didn't actually much use of it. It seems like it should be a great reference; it's packed with descriptions of various plants, their correspondences, and some of their properties. But this is very much a magical reference text, not an academic or medical-style herbal. If you're trying to figure out which herb to use for spellwork, this may be the book for you. If you're trying to figure out which herb to take for your headache, have a cup of mint tea and read something else!",6,2
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Bettina,3,11,4,"March 21, 2015","Certainly not the sort of book one would read from beginning to end, but a very useful reference book and one I use often. The index allows you to look up herbs by the proper name, Folk name or Latin name. For each herb you will find the related Gender, Planet, Element, Deities, Powers as well as magical and ritual uses. Only drawback here is while Cunningham's reference list is long, he does not indicate which source is used to back up the claimed properties of each herb. While this book is great as a quick reference book, it will not tell you why a plant is related to a specific planet or deity. This book also provides a very basic introduction to working magic, the basic principles of magic and how to use herbs to make oils, ointments, sachets and more. The illustrations leave a little something to be desired, if you are looking for a tool to help you identify different herbs, this may not be your best option. ",4,N/A
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Lodane,100,10,2,"November 18, 2018","The 1-5 Star Review is the total of what I have to say about this book, specifically.Caveat: This review is historical/archival in nature. 'Date read' is speculative.This book is one of many books I have read about the occult/paganism/witchcraft. This was the readily available faith in my household as a child. Additionally, I worked for a company in this field, 2015-2016, and had to read an ocean of this stuff to do my job.Like televangelists, and snake-oil salesman, these publishers prey on the vulnerable. The authors are mentally ill: suffering from 'magical thinking' and delusions. Worst of all, most of them can't write worth a damn.Llewellyn Worldwide is the absolute worst on both counts. I wouldn't even trust their overpriced CALENDARS to be accurate.These books are also big offenders on the the 'cultural appropriation' front. In fact, they're in the running for worst case ever. So-called 'eclectic witches' steal aspects of other religions and mythology. They make it clear that they don't understand them, or feel the need to, before shitting in someone else's bed. The publishers/authors then profit off this, leaving the reader less smart and more broke. The living Venn diagram of demographics for these books would look like this: She's a white, American woman. She dropped out of college to attend massage/cosmetology school. Growing up, her strict parents took her to church every Sunday. She kissed a girl 10 years ago, and likes Katy Perry. To quote Holden from Chasing Amy, ""Over- or underweight [people] who don't get laid - they're our bread and butter.""Though a copypasta of it, these books never tell you about hermeticism. They don't prime you to understand hermeticism. Hermeticism, by the way, is also total bullshit. It is, at least, historic -- and seminal in almost all spooky fiction involving rituals or alchemy.If I give one of these books anything above 2 stars, it's a decent example of this type of book. It might have a redeeming feature, like reference material for fictional world-building. Having worked in this field, including sales of these exact books, I can tell you... the fix is in, they know it, don't buy this stuff.",3,N/A
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Joan DeArtemis,32,10,5,"May 25, 2011","This is one of my two absolute favorite books on the magical use of herbs. It is fun and easy to use, and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in undertaking the practice of Wicca or modern Witchcraft. Scott Cunningham was a wonderful, light hearted, positive Light Being (I knew him personally), and everyone I know who uses this book loves it. There has been some criticism that everything in it is not based in perfect scholarship. However, that does not matter. This book has been in active use by practitioners for over 30 years. Based on that, it stands on its own.",3,N/A
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Valrie Wylde,2,2,5,"December 1, 2014","I have to say, this is one of the books on my shelf that is filled with post it notes and book marks.. I use it a LOT and you can really tell as I'm soon going to have to order another copy! It's been tremendously handy when I've been making incense and herbal kits as there's just so much to draw from.It's a fabulous go to book for just starting out as well as seasoned practitioners who work with herbs as it's filled with helpful information. There's quite a lot you can sink your teeth into.It's one of those books that I'd recommend as a ""must have"" in your library. ",3,N/A
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Ailyn,4,4,3,"November 9, 2010","I've realized that my expectations for what I want n an herbal, and what is actually out there, are two completely different things. Yet Cunningham's Encyclopedia has more of what I would want, with some folk history of the different herbs. I don't like that everything is structured into the generic Greek 4 element model, but you get that with Wicca and ceremonialism. As a supplemental reference book, I feel it does pretty well, and it did spark my interest into herbalism.",3,N/A
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Katherine,340,3,5,"August 5, 2018"," This is an encyclopedia about herbs. Cunningham includes folklore, edibility, and ways these plants can be prepared. Symbols are included in each profile to signify for medical use or for spells. The reader should use their common sense. Out of all Cunningham's books I see this one as the most important. I use this book as a reference any time I am making gris-gris bags, tea, or gardening.

145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Swankivy,"1,173",132,4,"November 9, 2007","You don't really ""read"" or ""finish"" this book because it's more of a look-up-what-you-need encyclopedic book, but it's very clear and concise and informative. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a down-to-earth magical herbal guide--interesting for folklore buffs as well as Crafters, ya know?",3,N/A

145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Nicole Reid,8,3,2,"August 14, 2021","As much as Scott Cunningham’s work and influence needs and deserves recognition for his contributions to Wicca in the last 25 years, I really don’t like this book and I wish it wasn’t recommended so often for beginners.While the elemental and planetary correspondences of the plants are useful, overall I find the thoroughness of the information offered in regard to the magical uses of the plants woefully lacking. The ‘Powers’ of each plant sometimes leave out properties mentioned in the ‘Magical Uses’ descriptions and it’s overall a frustrating book to read because of it’s hodge-lodge approach.The sloppy organization of the information offered in this book is odd because the annotated bibliography at the back of the book is extensive. Obviously the author did a lot of research. I would have expected the book to be much more detailed and thorough because of the author’s research (even M.A. Grieve’s ‘A Modern Herbal’ - which is cited as a reference in the bibliography - has better information than what the author provides in this book). And with literal scads of information throughout human history on the ways in which plants were used in folk and ritual practices (hello - even the Bible has info on this stuff and even recipes for oils and incenses if you read it carefully!), I really would have expected more from this book given it’s underserved popularity.And I’m entirely confused about why gender is associated with any of the plants mentioned since the application of the concept of gender to plants is problematic to say the least.I’ve often wished for a better overall reference than this book and have even resorted to complying my own spreadsheet out of sheer frustration. This book shouldn’t be relied upon as a sole reference for any beginning practitioner and I’d really only use it as a cross-reference myself.",2,N/A
145562,Cunninghams Encyclopedia of Magical Herbs,Carrie,3,2,5,"June 29, 2008","This is my herbal bible! My current copy is starting to fall apart by the binding from over use, the plastic on the cover is coming away from the paper, the pages are well loved...A lot of people think Cunningham is too simple, that he's a 'good place to start', but why overcomplicate things when they're so effective to begin with? I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants more info on magical herbs.",2,N/A

An absolute MUST have if your interested in learning more in this area, I promise you will return to it again and again.",2,N/A
