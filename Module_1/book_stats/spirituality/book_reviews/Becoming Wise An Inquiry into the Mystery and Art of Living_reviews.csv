25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Westley Dangles,40,10,3,"October 6, 2018","I am a huge fan of her podcast but I could only finish half this book and here's why: Tippett writes excellent sentences and paragraphs but, cohesively, this was not an excellent book. It's like when you ramble on through a bottle of wine on a Friday night with an incredibly eloquent friend and she just keeps showing you all these YouTube videos (except here it's poems) and you're like ugh Krista let's just have a straightforward discussion. Or maybe you enjoy that kind of stuff--in that case you'd give this 5 stars. So maybe I just needed a bottle of wine.",48,5
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Swrp,561,86,4,"September 13, 2020","""History always repeats itself until we honestly and searchingly know ourselves.""Krista Tippett`s Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living is a book, as the title suggests, about ""becoming wise"". The book is also about achieving and living with high moral standards. ""You try to appeal to the goodness of every human being and you don't give up. You never give up on anyone.""Krista Tippett includes her personal thoughts and also from the conversations she had with many people of knowledge. The book focuses on five concepts - words, flesh, love, faith and hope.
  ""But I have seen that wisdom emerges precisely through those moments when we have to hold seemingly opposing realities in a creative tension and interplay: power and frailty, birth and death, pain and hope, beauty and brokenness, mystery and conviction, calm and buoyancy, mine and yours.
An inspiring, informative and fun read!""We have been treating Earth as a supply house and a sewer. We have been grabbing, extracting resources from it for our cars, and our hairdryers, and our bombs, and we`ve been pouring the waste into it until its overflowing, but our Earth is not a supply house and a sewer. It is our larger body. We breathe it. We taste it. We are it!"" ""I'm stretching my point only a bit when I say that in American Life, every vision must begin and end in an economic argument in order to be heard, on urgent matters of human life: labor, education, immigration, refugees, prisons, poverty, healthcare. Rename these ""issues"" in light what is at stake in human terms.We know in our hearts and minds that we are bigger and wilder and more precious than numbers, more complex than any economic outcome or political prescription can describe.""",47,3
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Clif Hostetler,"1,056",680,3,"May 17, 2022","Becoming Wise contains snippets of the author’s autobiography, but most of the book's attention is given to excerpted interview conversations from her NPR show, On Being. These excerpts are introduced with commentary by the author which provide perspective and context. The audio edition of this book contains the actual audio recordings from the On Being broadcasts. (Note: In May 2022 it was announced that as of June 2022 the On Being show would be changing from a weekly show to a ""seasonal podcast."")The book’s narrative and conversation excerpts are organized into five chapters focusing on five concepts— words, flesh, love, faith, and hope. The author, Krista Tippett, identifies these five concepts as the “raw materials” of “superstar virtues” of “love, compassion [and] forgiveness.”The types of interviewees referenced by this book are wide-ranging from poets to scientists, and from theologians to atheists. As suggested by the show’s name “On Being” the interviews focus on various life philosophies and generally include a visit to the subject of spirituality.Krista Tippett refers to these interviewees as conversational partners. At the end of the book is included a list of 414 conversational partners from the On Being show between the years 2003-2015. All of these conversations can be accessed at http://onbeing.org. The following is a list of the names of conversational partners that are quoted in this book. Many of them are referenced more than once throughout the book, but I have listed them only once in the order in which they first show up in the book. I have included links with each name to their biographic data. The book also includes numerous references (not listed below) to various writers, poets, and historical people who have not been conversational partners on the On Being, show.

25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Mara,"1,458",3540,3,"February 29, 2020","I loved the content of this book, but it did not fully work for me as a book rather than as a collection of interviews from a podcast. This worked much better for me when I switched to the audio, and with that said, I recommend just sticking to the podcast. You will get everything from it that this book has to offer (which is not nothing! just that the book is superfluous IMO)",12,N/A
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Joan,676,1 follower,2,"December 11, 2016","too many adjectives! such odd phrasing! how does one interpret '...some of the margins that are in fact the heart beat of society'? ; perhaps it is my current state of mind (too much at work, too much writing on my part), but I gave up on this book after the first section. It was simply too much work for not a lot of gain. Tippett has an interesting background and has interviewed many people who have things of interest to say, but the narrative pulling the pieces together was too heavily ornamented for comprehension. I was also uncertain of whether I agreed with the premise of the book 'What makes us human is our relationship with each other'. (an update of 'no man is an island'?) I stumbled over that one because those engaged in contemplative lives are in relationships with whom? I did get a small nugget in the form of a great quote 'Don't ask the mountain to move. Just take a pebble every time you visit' from John Paul Lederach (an expert in conflict resolution) Perhaps another time.",11,1 comment
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Jennifer Ridgway,156,14,4,"April 21, 2016","This review originally ran on Everyday eBookAfter the first season of the podcast ""Serial"" ended, my social media feeds were filled with pleas for new, amazing programs to listen to; one of the most suggested was On Being, hosted by Krista Tippett. Tippett's podcast is a series of conversations (usually between Tippett and one guest) that explore what it means to be human. Guests include theologians from a variety of faiths, scientists of varied disciplines, authors, philosophers, poets, and activists. In her new book, Becoming Wise: An Inquiry Into the Mystery and Art of Living, Tippett distills some of what she has learned through her own life and through her numerous interviews and interactions into a guide on living.Tippett's previous book, Einstein's God: Conversations About Science and the Human Spirit, was a New York Times bestseller; in it, Tippett collected edited transcripts of conversations that were about science and religion. Becoming Wise, while including many snippets of her conversations, follows more of a narrative arc and captures Tippett's voice, including her own life experiences and learning curve. From her childhood in Oklahoma to her experiences as a journalist in the divided Berlin to her experiences as parent, she gives her audience insight into how her own views have evolved and changed.Becoming Wise is structured around five themes expressed with deceptively simple words: Words, Flesh, Love, Faith, and Hope. Accompanying each theme is a great exploration of how it affects us, how we can use it more effectively, how it fits into our greater civilization. This is not about wisdom as we learn in school: facts and reason. This is the wisdom of living in the world, living a good life, being present -- both physically and mentally. At one point, when addressing the question of what the commonality is among the wisest people she has met, she says, ""an embodied capacity to hold power and tenderness in a surprising, creative interplay ... it is an experience of physical presence as much as consciousness and spirit.""The conversations in Becoming Wise are a wonderful antidote to our current political climate. Filled with potential and acceptance, Tippett encourages civilized, respectful debate, kindness, and forgiveness. When presenting her with the National Medal of Honor, President Obama praised her for ""thoughtfully delving into the mysteries of human existence."" Becoming Wise is indeed a thoughtful dive into the mysteries while also pulling together the amazement of what we can be and what we can do.",9,N/A
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Judy,"1,573",26,3,"June 12, 2017","Finally. . . I finished this book! Though to be truthful, I scanned parts of it. A class at church has been studying it, and it is not meant to be a study book. We have had some good discussions, due mostly to the creativity of different facilitators. The book is loaded with gems, but the formatting made it difficult for me to read. It has only five chapters, which are sooooo long. My advice: listen to Krista Tippett's podcasts. They are more digestible. ",9,N/A
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Anne,139,3,5,"June 15, 2016","It has taken me a while to read this book because I only ever wanted to take it in a bit at a time, and then sit with the lessons Tippett, host of the NPR show On Being, offers up, and savor them. Which means that, having now read through to the last page, I feel I wouldn't be remiss to go back to page one and start over: there is so much quiet, profound wisdom in this book.It is composed of six chapters: Introduction: The Age of Us; Words: The Poetry of Creatures; Flesh: the Body's Grace; Love: A Few Things I've Learned; Faith: Evolution; and Hope: Reimagined. It seemed particularly appropriate to finish this morning on hope, given yesterday's tragedy in Orlando. There is so much ignorance and hatred in this world, and yet it is important, imperative, not to succumb, but instead to nurture gratitude and hope and remain active, to fight against the bigotry and arrogance.Tippett, over the years, has spoken with hundreds of wise men and women. In this book, she turns to those conversations and reproduces some of the pithiest exchanges. Her quest feels very personal: she is trying to make sense (and heart) of it all for herself. But her quest also feels universal—because don't we all want to make sense of this crazy thing called life? The questions she asks, the thoughts she pursues, are questions and thoughts I might have if I paid these matters more attention. I thank her for doing it for me.My copy of the book is bristling with flags. For this report, I think I will just quote some of the lines and passages that struck me.""What does it mean to be human? What matters in a life? What matters in a death? How to be of service to each other and the world? These questions are being reborn, reframed, in our age of interdependence with far-flung strangers. The question of what it means to be human is now inextricable from the question of who we are to each other. We have riches of knowledge and insight, of tools both tangible and spiritual, to rise to this calling. We watch our technologies becoming more intelligent, and speculate imaginatively about their potential to become conscious. All the while, we have it in us to become wise. Wisdom leavens intelligences, and ennobles consciousness, and advances evolution itself.""She speaks of the inquiry into the nature of ""soul"" or ""spirit"" as leading ""organically, along straight or meandering paths, into the roots of the curiosity that becomes, in adulthood, passion and vocation.""In one conversation, she discusses ""generous listening,"" which itself is ""powered by curiosity. . . . It involves a kind of vulnerability—a willingness to be surprised, to let go of assumptions and take in ambiguity."" Generous listening, she says, yields better questions—because, contrary to what we learn in school, there is such a thing as a bad question. ""It's hard to meet a simplistic question with anything but a simplistic answer. It's hard to transcend a combative question. But it's hard to resist a generous question. We all have it in us to formulate questions that invite honesty, dignity, and revelation. There is something redemptive and life-giving about asking a better question."" Surely, Tippett herself epitomizes generous listening. When she needs to ""hold"" a question, turn it over in her mind, dwell on it, she's not afraid to do so.""The crack in the middle where people on both sides absolutely refuse to see the other as evil—this is where I want to live and what I want to widen.""""We are matter, kindred with ocean and tree and sky. We are flesh and blood and bone. To sink into that is a relief, a homecoming. Mind and spirit are as physical as they are mental. The line we'd drawn between them was whimsy, borne of the limits of our understanding. Emotions and memories, from despair to gladness, root in our bodies. . . . Our bodies are longing and joy and fear and a lifelong desire to be safe and loved, incarnate.""""If we are stretching to live wiser and not just smarter, we will aspire to learn what love means, how it arises and deepens, how it withers and revives, what it looks like as a private good but also a common good. I long to make this word echo differently in hearts and ears—not less complicated, but differently so. Love as muscular, resilient. Love as social—not just about how we are intimately, but how we are together, in public. I want to aspire to a carnal practical love—eros become civic, not sexual and yet passionate, full-bodied. Because it is the best of which we are capable, loving is also supremely exacting, not always but again and again. Love is something we only master in moments. It crosses the chasms between us, and likewise brings them into relief. It is as captive to the human condition as anything we attempt.""Oh, and there's so much more: about compassion, about allowing our hearts to be educated in relationship with others, about paradise being right in front of us, about mystery (which ""lands in us as a humbling fullness of reality we cannot sum up or pin down""), about befriending reality in all its beauty and pain, about hope and truth.She ends: ""We are so achingly frail and powerful all at once, in this adolescence of our species. But I have seen that wisdom emerges precisely through those moments when we have to hold seemingly opposing realities in a creative tension and interplay: power and frailty, birth and death, pain and hope, beauty and brokenness, mystery and conviction, calm and buoyancy, mine and yours. . . . The mystery and art of living are as grand as the sweep of a lifetime and the lifetime of a species. And they are as close as beginning, quietly, to mine whatever grace and beauty, whatever healing and attentiveness, are possible in this moment and the next and the next one after that.""",8,1 comment
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,David,645,293,3,"May 10, 2017","Krista Tippett is the host of the podcast On Being and as such has the chance to interview hundreds of physicists, spiritual leaders, thinkers, activists and more on how they grapple with meaning in the world. In Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living, she narrows her focus on words, flesh, love, faith and hope and dips in and out of a wellspring of past interviews. She’s a practiced interviewer playing host to some incredibly smart folks. The language is dense and prescriptive and is made for thoughtful contemplation not the aggressive consumption of my usual fare. You simply can’t chug through Rilke like you’re reading Rowling. I found myself tripping over the flowery optimism of the language. Still, I appreciate the exploration of ideas like how love demands effort and we should fight against its cheapening by appending it to Fridays, ice cream and “these shoes!” How faith is just as important to the atheist, and that science and religion need not be mutually exclusive. It’s just that when epiphanies are had on every page they tend to overlap and congeal diminishing their impact for me. ",5,N/A
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Anita,654,12,5,"August 26, 2019","Three years ago I read 30% of this book and felt I was not grasping it. This time I listened to the audiobook narrated by the author. There are many clips of interviews she did with wise people. This time I did understand and enjoyed the book immensely. It seems like such a wonderful resource of so much good thinking. I bought the ebook after listening to the audio, because there is so much that I want to follow up on. This book encouraged me to keep being the best me that I can be. So many wise people are saying that we need to keep hope alive. Doing the small part that we have before us especially in kindness is more important than we realize. That is just one aspect of the wisdom in this book, but it is what impressed me the most. I'm eager to read in print and look more into some of these people. I enjoy Krista Tippett's OnBeing podcast and fantastic website.",5,1 comment
25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Robin,198,6,5,"November 13, 2016","A beautiful collection of some of her most poignant interviews over the years, woven together with her own wisdom. A rare book that I believe would be better in audio (as you hear the actual interviews rather than read the transcript).

If I had to choose one way, I would probably go with print, because there is so much of beauty to note here. :)",5,N/A

25894085,Becoming Wise An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,Deb (Readerbuzz) Nance,"5,734",279,4,"May 23, 2020","Krista Tippett is a journalist.""The discourse of our common life inclines towards despair. In my field of journalism, where we presume to write the first draft of history, we summon our deepest critical capacities for investigating what is inadequate, corrupt, catastrophic, and failing. The “news” is defined as the extraordinary events of the day, but it is most often translated as the extraordinarily terrible events of the day.""Let's switch that idea around, she suggests. Let's talk to people and see what wisdom they can share with us.That's what Tippett does in this book. She has sifted through hundreds of conversations she has had with people and she's shared the parts that touch on wisdom.Here's one example from a conversation Tippett has with physician Rachel Naomi Ramen. Ramen tells Tippett a story her grandfather, a rabbi, shared with her when she was a child.""In the beginning there was only the holy darkness, the Ein Sof, the source of life. In the course of history, at a moment in time, this world, the world of a thousand thousand things, emerged from the heart of the holy darkness as a great ray of light. And then, perhaps because this is a Jewish story, there was an accident, and the vessels containing the light of the world, the wholeness of the world, broke. The wholeness of the world, the light of the world, was scattered into a thousand thousand fragments of light. And they fell into all events and all people, where they remain deeply hidden until this very day. Now, according to my grandfather, the whole human race is a response to this accident. We are here because we are born with the capacity to find the hidden light in all events and all people, to lift it up and make it visible once again and thereby to restore the innate wholeness of the world. It’s a very important story for our times. This task is called tikkun olam in Hebrew. It’s the restoration of the world.""",2,N/A
