51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,tim,66,61,5,"February 17, 2012","This is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. In 1990, Dr. Rick Strassman succeeded in reinstating the first federally-approved study on a psychedelic substance in the U.S. since the 1960s. Not only did Dr. Strassman find a way through the impossibly long and thorny maze of contradicting laws and regulations, but the psychedelic compound he selected for his study was none other than dimethyltyptamine (DMT), one of the most powerful psychedelics ever known. In addition to his scientific, psychotherapeutic, and spiritual experience, it is Dr. Strassman’s remarkable evenhandedness that made him one of the few people who could have pulled this off. DMT is confounding for a number of reasons. Not only is it commonly found in many plants and animals, but DMT is also produced within our brains. DMT is a neurotransmitter manufactured in the pineal gland, which is located right in the center of our brains. The pineal has a long and mysterious history of being considered the “seat of the soul”—if you believe in such a thing. On that, Dr. Strassman has this to say about the possibility of a soul: Compare life and death: the state of being alive to that of being dead. One moment we are thinking, moving, and feeling. Cells are dividing, replacing dying ones with fresh recruits for the liver, lung, skin, and heart. The next moment we are no longer breathing; our heart has pumped its last beat. What is the difference? What’s gone that was just there? There is something that “enlivens” us when joined with our body. When present in matter, it shows itself by way of movement and heat. In the brain, it provides the power to receive, and transform into awareness, our thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. When it is gone, the light is extinguished and the engine stops. Whatever it is, the presence of this enlivening force provides us the opportunity to interact with this time and place. Dr. Strassman hypothesizes that the pineal gland produces DMT at critical moments in our brains, not least of all, at our time of birth and death. Does DMT usher the soul into and out of the body? DMT might also play a role in naturally occurring mystical and near-death experiences. While Dr. Strassman was expecting to encounter both psychotherapeutic and mystical experiences in his volunteers, he was not prepared for the overwhelmingly high frequency of contact they made with alien entities. The overlap of many DMT experiences with those reported by alien abductees is stunning. One volunteer had this to say about his alien contact during repeated DMT experiences within the tolerance study (of which there is remarkably no known human tolerance to DMT): It may not be so simple as that there are alien planets with their own societies. This is too proximal. It’s not like some kind of drug. It’s more like an experience of a new technology than a drug. You can choose to attend to this or not. It will continue to progress without you paying attention. You return not where you left off, but to where things have gone since you left. It’s not a hallucination, but an observation. When I’m there, I’m not intoxicated. I’m lucid and sober.So what exactly is going on? DMT, a molecule manufactured within each and every one of us, not only separates consciousness from our bodies, but commonly brings people into contact with alien entities. Unlike other psychedelics, such as LSD and psilocybin which suppress the individual ego while under their influence, DMT leaves the ego intact, making the DMT experience all the more shocking and bizarre. The nature of these alien contacts, what these “aliens” actually are, is only one of many questions that arise around DMT.Since DMT is an intrinsic and inseparable part of our bodies, its mysteries pertain to everyone. And even though DMT’s mysteries are so strange that they often prove difficult to accept, let alone understand, we must continue trying to understand them. A better understanding of DMT will hopefully lead to a better understanding of who we are. Since DMT currently raises more questions than answers, more research and attention are obviously needed. That DMT is illegal -- a molecule found inside each and every one of us -- is a ridiculous farce. We are all, in essence, carrying around an illicit substance in our heads.I am not advocating that everyone rush out and try DMT, far from it. Instead my intention is to bring DMT and its little-understood relation to the body to the attention of those who have not yet heard of it. If I have succeeded in piquing anyone’s interest in learning more about DMT, this book is a great place to start. With that I leave you with one last excerpt highlighting Dr. Strassman’s hope in future psychedelic research: In addition to the treatment of clinical disorders, psychedelics could be used to enhance characteristics of our normal state of being, such as creativity, problem-solving abilities, spirituality, and so on. DMT elicited ideas, feelings, thoughts, and images our volunteers said they never could have imagined. Psychedelics stimulate the imagination, and thus they are logical tools to enhance creativity. The problems facing our society and planet require the use of novel ideas as much as new and more powerful technology. It’s impossible to overstate the urgent need to improve our imaginative abilities.",79,37
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Nathan,88,12,2,"November 27, 2012","Let down by my ""high"" expectations. HEY-OH.OK. Here's the problem: Strassman simply does not give enough to the scientists. Maybe his intention was to collect a bunch of case studies to show the reoccurring themes induced in the minds of those under the influence of DMT, but I walked away from a rather long book with only a handful of facts. No, I wasn't looking for a full description about what it's like to take the drug; I realize that explaining the experience of seeing a color requires a poet and to simply have experienced it yourself. But given his medical and scientific background, I did expect a deeper and more rigorous treatise of the chemical. The experiments he ran were only alluded to and referenced. What were some of the major findings? What impact did these findings have? And in particular, what are the neuroscientific and physiological consequences of the drug? Strassman presented more speculation and theories than data.  I found the most interesting chapters to be the introduction and general scientific background of psychedelics, and a chapter where Strassman laboriously goes through how he got permission to perform sanctioned research on psychedelics. Surprise: you just need contacts in the right places and to be at the right place at the right time. I also enjoyed musing on the interesting ""coincidence?"" that most people experience similar themes during their adventures in the DMT realms. Nevertheless, I squirmed as a scientist with Strassmans' willingness to make speculative claims about how the vague similarities in stories told between different users was perhaps a sign of parallel dimensions, alien encounters, alternative quantum states, etc. Note: though these unfounded claims were presented as speculation, but they still took up too much of the book and outweighed any scientific content. Finally, I believe the book finishes on a tone that precisely mirrors what it feels like to read the book. Strassman mentions that the medical and scientific models are intrinsically orthogonal to the experience, insight, and enjoyment of psychedelic trips, and implicates this as the major obstacle to his (or future) psychedelic research. Keeping stride, he backs up and essentially says: ""I'm not really sure what I learned from my DMT studies. The results were inconclusive. DMT remains a mystery."" This final ambiguity shines through in the book: as a reader, the text felt inconclusive and mysterious in its message.",44,11
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Erica,12,5,5,"December 4, 2007","It really is a shame that so much constraint is put on the research community when it comes to medicinal research. When something like DMT, an endogenous molecule that can even be found out in the yard is put under so much control one can only marvel as to why? The research Strassman does with DMT is very interesting, not only is it a great insight into the process of medicinal research but also an aspect of our bodies that remains undiscovered and/or mysterious. What causes the vividness of dreams? What is happening during a near death experience? Strassman aims to answer these questions and still leaves them open to speculation as the book ends (as research isn't always as well funded). I am happy that the research did not end with this book but will be pursued further despite government restrictions/control.",17,1 comment
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Erik Graff,"4,983",1083,4,"March 22, 2012","This one came in the mail as a gift from a friend, a very, very good friend as it was exactly what I wanted most to read at the time.Despite the prohibition of research on naturally occuring psychotropic drugs--as opposed to patented pharmaceuticals!--instituted by the Nixon administration in the seventies and the still continuing and unwinnable war on drugs enforced by the DEA et alia, some people continue to be seriously interested in the implications of such altered states of consciousness as relativize ordinary epistemological and ontological presuppositions.The author, a research scientist at the University of New Mexico Medical Center, represents in this book several stories. One is political, the story of how, over years, was finally able to obtain permission to study DMT, the only known psychedelic naturally produced in the human body. Another is personal and political. He is a believing Anglo-Buddhist, a member of a congregation who found himself treated by his coreligionists like mediaeval mystics tended to be treated by the Vatican. Another is professional. Previous work on sleep and the pineal gland led him to one of the gland's psychoactive products. He was given the necessary clearances because of a record of research and publication which it could be argued led to the topic of this book. Another is his account of this research project itself, the experimental design, the participants (all of whom, ironically, had to be experienced illegal drug users in order to qualify for the study so as to protect the university from lawsuits) and the results.The most interesting, and ostensibly unexpected, result of the study, a result which led far afield from the awarded grant proposals and governmental permits, was that a significant percentage of subjects went to other worlds, worlds reminiscent of Terence McKenna's stories and stage performances, worlds remiscent, to me, of personal experience and, in one case, to the ""gnostic"" texts of the first centuries of the last millenium.It's no big deal to go to other worlds, idiosyncratic ones. We do it every night, virtually all of us, dreaming. The big deal would be if we went, lots of us, to the same worlds, world not clearly derived from this one, worlds similar in ways that cannot be accounted for by similar conditionings of subjects. The claim that his disparate set of subjects did just that makes this book very important indeed.Note that this is a popular book which attempts to explain some serious biochemistry. It does it well. The nonspecialist reader gets a short, understandable course in neuroanatomy. The footnotes are there for those who want to pursue the vetted, academic papers.",11,4
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Sara Hunter,47,4,4,"June 9, 2008","I'm reading this book right now, and it's fascinating. As a psychology student (sort of), I'm particularly interested in how psychedelics work with our brains to help facilitate better therapy as well as to treat some medical problems. DMT is probably the most interesting of these chemicals, because it's something that is found in our own bodies (and also practically everywhere if you've read any Shulgin) yet its benefits have been downplayed like crazy. What I liked best about this book were all the case studies. It's too bad that it's currently illegal to conduct psychedelic research on consenting human subjects in the US; there's a lot that could be learned from this substance. What I found most fascinating was the recurring ""theme"" in a lot of the recorded experiences that seemed to involve what were described as alien encounters (Rick Strassman has a new book that talks about this aspect of the DMT and other psychedelic experiences a little more in-depth). Part of this is because I love anything to do with alien/UFO encounters; part of it is because it's interesting to me that so many people (who didn't know each other at all so there was little chance of collaborating on a story) described similar experiences. I highly recommend this book if you've got an open mind; this book will blow your mind!",10,N/A
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Scot Parker,268,49,4,"March 31, 2021","This is an excellent book from a person who conducted a great deal of research into the effects of DMT on the human mind. The book combines a discussion of empirical studies with more philosophical speculations regarding this molecule. I would have rated this book 5 stars except that there is a bit of woo that the reader must sort through. Overall I'd give this book an A- regarding its ratio of good information to nonsense. If you're interested in psychedelic research and the psychedelic experience, this book will likely interest you; check it out!",10,N/A
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Red,17,1 follower,4,"May 8, 2009","No question about it, this book changed my life. The very fact that the human body produces N,N-DMT, one of the most powerful hallucinogens that the West is aware of, absolutely changed my perspectives about spirituality and religion. I had been aware of issues like temporal lobe epilepsy and other conditions that can produce visionary states, but the fact that every healthy human produces DMT (in varying quantities) completely complicated my atheistic worldview. No longer do I think of visionary/mystical reports as lies, but rather as neuro-biological functions to which nearly every human is in some sense capacity capable of. Who knows, it may even have some function in the fascinating science of dreaming.I disagree with many of Strassman’s speculations. However, he clearly states that they are indeed speculations rather than simply spouting fantastic fictions and attaching his degree as a badge of authority on the matter. This I feel is intellectually honest and deepens my respect of the man. A powerful book. A landmark in reintroducing psychedelic studies. A fascinating step forward in understanding human consciousness. -Red",8,N/A
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Brad,5,2,5,"December 20, 2007","In DMT: The Spirit Molecule, Strassman tells the story of how he came to be interested in psychedelics as neurochemcial tools to unlocking the mind and consciousness and the subsequent research that he conducted to explore the one chemical he theorized was central to it all: DMT. In the first part of the book he details the harrowing experience of gaining approval from various review boards, funding sources, and ultimately the DEA and FDA - who would be the ultimate decision makers in whether he could have access to the drug, which is scheduled by the US Gov't among other drugs deemed to be of high potential for abuse and to have no potential for medical use. A socio-cultural perspective on this topic can be found in Daniel Pinchbeck's ""Breaking Open the Head."" Once he received the proper authorizations to go about his research, Strassman embarked on what would be a five year project involving the administration of DMT to 60 patients. All of the participants were volunteers and were chosen on two primary factors: previous experience with psychedelics and overall mental stability (indicated by strong relationships, usually). What he finds throughout the process of his research ...Well I've already gone into far too much detail (more than a review should contain I realize - I'm new at this) so I'm going to end my synopsis there and allow prospective readers to finish where I've left off.Prospective readers would include anyone with an interest in the mind and consciousness, as well as an openness to the possibilities that lie in the little known world beyond the realms of our normal perception. The book itself is a pleasure to read. Strassman's writing is clear and his reasoning process is sound. Despite his established career as a scientist and researcher, he writes in an engaging and non-technical way. He goes about presenting his argument in a thorough, well-reasoned, and well-supported manner -- taking care to point out previous research. Strassman makes clear his own background and interest in the study. He is careful, however, never to mention whether he's ever personally experimented with psychedelics. I understand is reasons for leaving this out however, I think it would provide a lot of context for his theories and research.Nevertheless, ""The Spirit Molecule"" is a great read and suggests a lot of exciting possibilities for the future of scientific exploration into psychedelics. Hopefully his fresh and frankly remarkable findings will inspire others to tread down similar paths. We must also hope that his study, which proved safe for his subjects and fruitful for the scientific community, will help change minds among politicians and legislators about this drug in particular, and psychedelics in general (nearly all of which are scheduled as the most heinous and useless in existence).",7,N/A
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Artiom Karsiuk,173,11,3,"July 3, 2014","I have an older brother. He was/is a witty guy with street smarts - not dumb by any stretch of the imagination. In many ways, I looked up to him, but in his teen years he fell head-first into heroin and, as of this moment, never came back for his ""happily ever after"". Since then I have been fascinated with drugs. Fascinated, because that was my first realization that if they could hook him, I can fall into the same trap just as easily if I don't mind my Ps and Qs. So around that age I vowed to read-up on any drug I was about to introduce into my body. What I did was, take a big fat stick and draw [or shovel] a thick line between heavy drugs and psychedelics, and proceeded to explore the latter. Right now, my experience with psychedelics is minimal - I dabbled in them on a very juvenile level: mostly for recreation and not as a tool for spiritual exploration, because I am still a manchild of 25 years and have no ""deep shit"" to sort through at this early stage of my life. Yet, somehow I agreed to join my friend for an ayahuasca retreat in a couple of months from today in the heart of the Amazon jungle. The first thing I did after saying ""yes"" to that loony plan, was buy this book to get a peak at what's in store for us.The main reason I bought this book in particular, aside from having my ""life coach"" Joe Rogan rave about it for many years, were two precious letters the author had next to his name: M.D. Before my pimpled face travels thousands of miles to get a taste of Peruvian shamanism, I was interested in reading what a Doctor of Medicine thinks about DMT and it's affects on our fragile meatsuits. Even though I realize that ayahuasca and pure IV administered DMT (discussed in this book) are two different animals, the book did give me a lot of information to work with. As it turned out, Rick's opinions, insights and comments were only the side dishes to the main course: the experiences of the study participants. These people visited various states ranging from unconditional love to terrifying darkness. Near death and out of body experiences, contacts with a higher intelligence (or ""beings""): their stories gave me something to try and mentally prepare for, if that is at all possible. Though there were some disturbing trips described in this book (i.e. the ""Pain and Fear"" chapter had few hugs and rainbows), I enjoyed its overall positive message as Dr. Strassman made it clear that The Spirit Molecule [in simple terms] should not be messed with. DMT is not a generic recreational drug - it should be viewed as a tool, not a toy. Or, at least, that's what I'm trying to convince myself of, because I am kind of wetting my pants before my upcoming audience with the Ayahuasca Goddess.P.S. Who am I kidding... I bought the book for the cover. Alex Grey is just badass.",7,N/A
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Marjan,152,39,4,"May 20, 2014","Despite very new-age cover this book is far from being detached from our reality. In fact; it is a very hard core medical description (for wider audience, of course) of a very curious experiment that took place in a hospital in New Mexico, with all the milligrams per kilogram, seconds and Latin names you'd expect from such report. Again; for public audience, but nothing seems to be sacrificed in the pursuit of intelligibility. The first part will take you into the process of preparations from neuro-anatomy-chemistry (especially in regard of the pineal gland) to legal labyrinth that Strassman had to navigate to get the approvals and grants.Then you are taken right into the heart of the experiment with medical descriptions and 1st hand reports of the volunteers. These stories are something!The last third features authors monologue on the future and value of this research. What does it all mean for our understanding of consciousness, spiritual experience and its role in society...What certainly came unexpected to Strassman and might surprise a reader is once more this incredible consistency of reports, not just from volunteers, but also across the geography and time, on one end with prehistoric shamanic rituals, then to Dante or Swedenborg and ending with alien abduction report in the 20th century. There is just something to it that cannot be denied and we can only hope for more of controlled experiments that might shed some light on this phenomena. ",7,4
51654,DMT The Spirit Molecule,Sally,"1,477",50,3,"August 27, 2016","In describing his scientific study of DMT (the hallucinogen prominent in many Amazonian psychedelics) in a university hospital in the 1990s, the author discusses its chemical properties, the process by which the study was approved, how the study was run in detail, the psychological effects and experiences, and concludes that in itself the drug is not beneficial, but that all depends upon the context in which it is taken and what the person involved brings to the experience. To me it was especially interesting that animals, including humans, naturally produce DMT in their bodies (some plants do also). Does it have a role in facilitating in the way we naturally perceive the world? Also, that people given the drug experienced not only ""psychedelic"" and near-death-like experiences, but also ""alien contact"" experiences indistinguishable from those reported by people claiming alien abduction, surprised and disturbed the author. I would have preferred to focus on just the drug's properties and effects, and the author's conclusions, instead of having so much information about his setting up and running the study.",6,N/A

Also the early chapters where Strassman cheerfully throws all scientific rigor out the window and free associates wildly like some deranged mystic left a bad taste in my mouth. Really?... the pineal gland may be the portal of the spirit into the body?, and wow did you know that it takes 46 days in the Tibetan book of the dead for the spirit to leave the body, and golly that's the same amount of time it takes before a human fetus shows the first signs of gender, isn't that ""intuitively appealing"".

This book will challenge your assumptions about life, death, consciousness, even the great unkown of outerspace. Is DMT a drug? Is it a tool? Is it the secret of life? After reading this book, I think I vote for all of the above.Someday the serious research of DMT started by Dr. Rick Strassman will continue. Until then, fundamentalists and evangelicals will continue to try to sweep this kind of research under the rug.
