54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Kevin Wilson,2,3,5,"April 8, 2021","Reading an advance copy of Sadhguru’s “Karma” book was a profound experience. It brought back glimpses I have had of the unknowable and unexplainable, and finally gave them meaning and context.  In the book Sadhguru describes karma as a vast library of past, present, and future events – a place he said he often ventures into for answers to life’s most complex questions. So many times, I’ve seen someone ask Sadhguru a question, and then he glances away and closes his eyes for a split second, and then returns with the perfect answer.  Sadhguru has explained in “Karma” how we are creating new additions for the karmic library, and how we can gain more control over the direction our lives are taking. It becomes clear when reading this book why Sadhguru stresses responsibility and awareness in Inner Engineering, and the inevitability of the moment – because of each of us are creating our lives using a karmic pattern that everyone who has ever lived on this planet has contributed to.  How did we get to where we are now in life? Where is it going next? Why does the groupthink of society seem to be going in the wrong direction? All of the answers are in this karmic library of experiences, memory, and potential futures. So, what can we do to change it with the small hands, head, and heart that we have? That is the essence of why I was first moved by Sadhguru. Working together, we might be able to help the world change course.  I think Sadhguru’s book, “Karma,” could be the first step in that direction for many people who have not yet experienced what we have as Isha meditators. It provides answers to so many deep questions. That’s why I highly recommend getting a copy of this book, reading it for yourself, and then sharing it with your friends.",47,2
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Arvind Benegal,1,2,5,"April 12, 2021","Karma means Action. Your life is your Karma. It is entirely your doing!With these simple yet profound truths, Sadhguru delves into exploring the mechanics of this oft misunderstood and maligned word. It leaves the reader with said truths prevailing and shining through this riveting and utterly absorbing user manual, which most of humanity has unfortunately long ignored to pay attention to.The book aims to completely upend the conventional misinterpretation of the term Karma, and succeeds brilliantly by providing utmost clarity about what it really is! What becomes clear through the entirety of this wonderfully crafted manual is that Karma is the most dynamic way to exist, and brings to fore our own limitations in dealing with it head on. Karma is an elaborate and sophisticated mechanism, but we simply don’t have a grip on it, primarily because we haven’t taken charge of our life and faculties!Even when one is not doing anything in particular, one’s body, mind, emotions and energy are all in action. These four actions of Karma are happening every moment of one’s life - in wakefulness and in sleep. The real question is how much of it has been conducted consciously, and how much is purely accidental?With his inimitable wit and wisdom, Sadhguru demystifies this complex subject into a practical guide, enabling and empowering one to craft one’s own destiny.",38,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Tina Shah,1,4,5,"April 18, 2021","Sadhguru has written a masterpiece, a beautiful one-of-a-kind book on what it means to be a human being and what we can do right now.Karma is a trip! For a long time, I thought that the point of life was to get good karma to have a pleasant life. It turns out karma is not what I thought it was. It's not something to get ahead of. Instead, it is an absolute miracle worth exploring. Read this book if you want to be amazed, empowered, and want an action plan for life.",27,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Christine Perakis,1,1 follower,5,"April 15, 2021","I had no idea, before reading Sadhguru’s Karma book, just how wrong I got it. I thought that “karma” was a system of punishments and rewards, that when misfortune happened, I was paying back a past-due debt, and good deeds were a deposit towards some future reward. Even if I handled whatever was thrown my way, I secretly believed that I didn’t really have control, and life felt like suffering – a series of judgments of good and bad, with no equanimity.In this beautiful, eye-opening book, Sadhguru turns the tables by showing us clearly that Karma is an empowering possibility for taking charge of our lives by choosing how we respond to what is happening. This book gives us the tools and actual practices to make this shift in taking responsibility, as the first step towards our true liberation and a more conscious planet. Sadhguru challenges us to start by bringing joy and gratitude to everything we do, and eliminating a single question, “what about me?” as a necessary step to annihilate an inflated sense of self-importance to reach our true potential, as individuals and as a part of humanity. I cannot think of a more important book to share!",24,2
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Ashish Iyer,737,458,4,"September 6, 2021",Sadhguru has broken the karma concept in easy language. It gives a clear understanding of the term karma and give clear meaning with prompt examples for better understanding. How living in the moment makes such a big difference and why it is important. It dispels many misconceptions about Karma and make us realized how lightly we are using 'karma' word for everything. Each chapter has Sadhana or Kriya for practice. This book will change the very purpose of life. Even his previous book Death changed many perspective of mine. It changes the way how we look towards life. I recommend everyone to read his Karma and Death book. Enlightening read they were.,20,2
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Ahselhs,50,3,5,"April 13, 2021","Book about KARMA! That too by SADHGURU!!!! OMG! Karm Yog book by Swami Vivekanand had always been a gem of my life, I reread that book every year. And now knowing that I'll get to read more about it from Sadhguru's perspective is just ❤",20,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Avani ✨,"1,469",287,3,"November 6, 2021","Karma: A Yogi's Guide to Crafting Your Destiny by Sadhguru is a new perspective on the overused and misunderstood concept of ""karma"" that offers the key to happiness and enlightenment. The book definitely holds a lot of goodness to it. I have been always wanted to read his books, and hence I picked this up.In Karma, Sadhguru seeks to put you back in the driver's seat, turning you from a terror-struck passenger to a confident driver navigating the course of your own destiny. By living consciously and fully inhabiting each moment, you can free yourself from the cycle. Karma is an exploration and a manual, restoring our understanding of karma to its original potential for freedom and empowerment instead of a source of entanglement. Through Sadhguru's teachings, you will learn how to live intelligently and joyfully in a challenging world.I am currently half way through the book and I am quite impressed with the thoughs and writings of Sadhguru in this book. But however, there are some lessons and learning which does not line with my principles, but nevertheless, this happens with every spiritual and self-help book, and we should always seek to explore new perspectives on these topics.",15,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Trent,2,2,5,"April 12, 2021","Reading “Karma” was a profound journey of realizing just how little I actually understood about karma. As I came to terms with all the falsehoods I’ve held about this term, I began to understand that karma offers the possibility of living in a conscious and inclusive manner. “Karma” illustrated the immense agency I have in moving from habitual and compulsive patterns to action that is discerning and conducive for my growth. I have found its insights trickling into my daily routine and activities -- continuous reminders that my life is my making. I no longer see karma as a bondage or punishment system; rather, I experience it as a pathway to a liberated life.Beyond all the lessons learned, what stood out most to me was Sadhguru’s emphasis on the miracle of being human: we have the potential to live in absolute freedom, crafting an enduring experience of joy, bliss and peace. I feel inspired to work upon myself and see my life as an intentional expression of my happiness -- no longer a pursuit of it.",15,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Kushagra Singh,140,21,4,"May 3, 2021","A book cannot contain Karma as a concept and its intricacies; Karma is an experience that dawns upon a seeker in time. Sadhguru isn’t trying to explain intricate philosophies as well via the book. Through the book, he espouses a way of living that no matter what kind of action you perform, you can make it joyful for you. What I most admire and resonate with Sadhguru is how he treats karma as a matter of taking responsibility. Without getting into endless debates on how, what, when, why (although such themes are addressed to an extent), the reader is encouraged to take stock of what is and try and make something good from it for themselves and the world around them. The long time followers of Sadhguru’s work will not find any new content as such. Much of the book’s content has already been disseminated in Inner Engineering programs, the Inner Engineering book etc. However, the book is a nice reinforcement of the good ideas accumulated from the programs and is a page turner. Everyone will enjoy the book as well written, easily understood (at least on gross level) and comes handy with nice exercises (Sadhna) one can try and experiment by themselves. A pleasant read. 😊",9,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,mahesh,212,8,4,"May 7, 2021","Received this copy on Apr 27th, Content in the book try to debunk the myth and distortion corrupting the meaning of ""Karma"". Once you reach the ending of the book, Your discretion theory of Karma will take a turn towards personal responsibility. The book is divided into three segments Firstly, it reveals the fallacy in our understanding of Karma and offers an authentic meaning. Secondly, it explores Karma yoga and the reduction of different types of karma through conscious practice. Every main topic ends with Sadhana in between to assimilate practice along with the wisdom. Lastly, books end with a question and answers related to Karma. Though Content is enlightening and profound, You might get jaded to read if you have read Sadhguru's previous book because all these topics are explored in a separate chapter of the previous books. If you need an honest answer, I have learned nothing novel here, the Sole purpose of buying this book is to contribute to the ISHA Foundation for the good fare of those in need. If you are already read Karma yoga by Vivekandad and previous books By Sadhguru, You might not be going to enjoy it entirely.",8,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Arsh,40,12,3,"November 7, 2021","If Karma revisits us from the past, it doesn't matter whether it is a past life or yesterday. Things can only be dealt with in the present. This book contains some of the deep questions that have been contemplated by sages and seers for centuries that could settle a tensed and distracted mind and explore such deep questions.However, its not very fruitful to use the doctrine of Karma to explain the world.Worrying about the Karma of other people is in the end a useless preoccupation by itself.",8,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Dawn,971,215,5,"May 2, 2021","Very good but a bit confusing, or overwhelming, to me at times.Sadhguru is a fully enlighten being, and speaks from experience and observation.There is an abundance of information and I would say that not everyone will be receptive to what is conveyed. He asks only that you explore and observe for yourself, not to blindly trust. He intertwines sadhanas, tools for self exploration, so you can do so. He dispels myths about Karma and explains how one can work toward not accumulating anymore as we all work in this lifetime to burn up our allotted karma.My only wish is that he elaborate more on certain topics.",7,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Tarini Chandrashekhar,24,7,5,"December 21, 2021","I'm only writing the review of this book so that the reader knows what they should be expecting when picking up the book because to actually review the book would be like explaining the ocean with a drop, and it would imply I comprehended everything mentioned in the book, which I don't, yet. In the modern context, we throw around Karma as a blanket phrase to mean the 'punishing hand', 'an excuse to explain our inaction', and even as a lazy explanation for 'doing good deeds', 'being good', or 'being nice'. Rarely does Karma get mentioned and comprehended in the context of work that needs to be done, and its intent, without polluting it with the subjective ideas of good or bad. There are many interesting and deep concepts concerning Karma, which are introduced throughout the book, and it might be overwhelming but if I had to observe a recurring theme throughout the book, which even the author admits to, openly, is the Karma Paradox - one who bases his every activity to shed his karma, is the one who ends up accumulating it more. It's something like living your life walking the rope of total involvement and abandonment all at once. It seems counter-intuitive at first if you're reading this. But the way this book puts it, it suddenly becomes clear, that if you're totally involved with the process, somewhere in the belly of the process, you've already distanced yourself from the outcome, and therefore your abandon is a natural outcome of your total involvement at the moment. As is with most books, you'll only read it, when it's time to receive it. Until you're internally ready to be a receptacle, it might be hard to finish the book. So, it's okay, if you pick it up and then leave it for later. It doesn't reflect anything other than the fact that it isn't time yet.",4,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,S Sharma,1,1 follower,1,"June 26, 2021","Nothing New Here I see nothing special about this book. The topics herein have been discussed umpteen times ad nauseam. There is no unique insight contained within it's pages like many of Osho's literary offerings, no analytical rigor like that produced by the Great Shakyamuni , nothing timeless like the Bible or even more so, the Gita, no poignant commentary like that offered by Krishnamurti , no heartfelt bhakti as amply demonstrated by Ramakrishna and no evidence of deep realization anywhere , as possessed by the greatest of all modern saints, Ramana Maharshi. Skip this light reading in favor of the aforementioned authors.",4,N/A
54895722,Karma A Yogis Guide to Crafting Your Destiny,Daksh Jindal,117,72,4,"December 5, 2022",Such an amazing book which goes deep into my favourite part of Bhagwad Gita that is Karma yoga. The way Sadhguru describes Karma and relates it to our real life is just eye opening. Part 1 of the book is my favourite as it goes deep into the practicalities of Karma and how to unchain ourselves from different types of Karmic memories.Part 2 and 3 goes deep into metaphysical world which is a little difficult grasp but very fascinating to imagine. I can’t comment on that part much as I need to experience it to believe and I am sure I will experience it one day.Overall a very good book which makes you feel like Sadhguru is sitting in front of you revealing all the yogic knowledge.,4,N/A
