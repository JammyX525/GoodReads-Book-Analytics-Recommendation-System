30118,A Light in the Attic,Austin,56,19,5,"March 7, 2008","Every child eventually discovers the perverted old man who wrote songs for Johnny Cash, did illustrations for Playboy, appeared on the Dr. Demento show numerous times, and managed to get a few books published along the way. For some reason, parents never seem to think this creepy old guy who was so fond of children was in any way ""disturbing,"" something I'm continually impressed with in the ""ban now, ask questions later"" climate of modern culture. If there are people who don't like Shel Silverstein, I don't want to meet them. Or, more to the point, you shouldn't meet them if that is an option. Children need to experience this kind of creepy / weird / funny / sad stuff, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of having a conduit through which they can make sense of most of the rest of the world. Knowing that Shel sees things this way, too, makes it all easier to take, and makes your own oddness that much more tolerable. We, as humans, need to come to terms with inexplicable and unfathomable in the world, and it wasn't until Shel that we began to realize that the only way to gently help our children do just that, is to let a perverted old weirdo with a large stack of Playboys in his basement lead the way.",88,25

This is definitely not as amazing as  where the sidewalk ends,  but these poems hit just as hard. They‚Äôre fun for kids (totally recommend you to read them to your children: 5 and up) and you‚Äôll be shocked every time these give you some adult life lessons as well ü´∂üèª  also they‚Äôre so hilarious and intelligently written, every kid who grows up with this will 100% be smarter than everyone else.",31,1 comment
30118,A Light in the Attic,Whitney Atkinson,903,13700,4,"November 25, 2019","I got some Shel Silverstein books from the library to feed my nostalgia, and it was an interesting reread. They're as funny and easy and light as I remember, but I'm shocked by how much I didn't remember. Maybe I just skimmed it for the pictures as a kid, but still, these were entertaining to read out loud to my cats.",27,N/A
30118,A Light in the Attic,Janine,42,10,5,"April 9, 2007","The feelings I have about Shel Silverstein's A Light in the Attic and Where The Sidewalk Ends contrast so sharply with the books themselves. I loved these funny, whimsical and sometimes downright sadistic poems with all of my young heart. Even now, I feel like I'm getting away with something when I think of Clarence Lee from Tennesee who loved the commercials he saw on TV. I am still afraid for Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too who never returned to the world they knew. In Shel Silverstein's books I found all of my childish wishes drawn out to their natural, absurd conclusions. But I was also given a glimpse of the way that language could create beauty and inspire wonder, for we have some flax-golden tales to spin. Come in! Come in! I never guessed how a bald, bearded, barefoot man with a guitar could read my mind. It is not too much to say that I revere both works. Which is not the point of these poems at all. ",22,5

30118,A Light in the Attic,Ronyell,956,319,5,"March 15, 2014","‚ÄúA Light in the Attic‚Äù is one of Shel Silverstein‚Äôs best yet most controversial books of poems ever written. This book is full of poems about clowns, pirates, monsters and all manner of strange people and animals doing crazy things. ‚ÄúA Light in the Attic‚Äù may be too suggestive and morbid for smaller children, but older children will easily delight themselves with the silly shenanigans of the characters. Shel Silverstein‚Äôs writing is as witty as it is funny as he writes each character‚Äôs stories in a poetic prose. One of the funniest poems I have read was ‚ÄúSquishy Touch‚Äù when the main character turns everything into Jell-O. Shel Silverstein‚Äôs illustrations are highly creative as the images make the characters look scratchy and also I love the images being presented in black and white colors, a technique that is usually used for long books. The image that probably stood out the most was the image of the Gink as it has a large mouth with sharp teeth and the image of the kids coming out of the Gink on the next page. Parents should know that there are some suggestive and morbid content in this book that young children might not understand. One poem that might be too suggestive for children would be the poem ‚ÄúHow not to have to dry the dishes‚Äù as it entices children to break the dishes in order not to dry them. Another poem that might be too morbid for children would be ‚ÄúLittle Abigail and the Beautiful Pony‚Äù as it deals with the death of a child and parents might want to explain to their children about the concept of death before they read this poem. ‚ÄúA Light in the Attic‚Äù is an excellent book about silly poems about silly people who do crazy stunts and it will surely be an instant for many children young and old. I would recommend this book to children ages six and up since smaller children might be a bit disturbed by the suggestive and morbid content displayed in this book.

30118,A Light in the Attic,Valerie,155,73,5,"August 5, 2008","Recently, I started re-reading A Light in the Attic with my younger daughter, who's four-and-a-half. I think when I first read it I must have been about eight or nine years old, because I remember reading it myself, and loving it. (I must have checked it out of the library about a million times.) What's not to love? Shel gives us such gems as:BEAR IN THEREThere's a Polar BearIn our Frigidaire--He likes it 'cause it's cold in there.With his seat in the meatAnd his face in the fishAnd his big hairy pawsIn the buttery dish,He's nibbling the noodles,He's munching the rice,He's slurping the soda,He's licking the ice.And he lets out a roarIf you open the door.And it gives me a scareTo know he's in there--That Polary BearIn our Fridgitydaire.andHOT DOGI have a hot dog for a pet,The only kind my folds would let Me get.He does smell sort of badAnd yet,He absolutely never getsThe sofa wet.We have a butcher for a vet,The strangest vet you ever met.Guess we're the weirdest family yet,To have a hot dog for a pet.Of course, she loves almost all of the poems. And I'd forgotten that the wonderful illustrations were also by Silverstein. One word of caution for parents reading to younger kids: some of the poems do deal (albeit in a silly way) with issues such as drowning (in your own tears), getting kidnapped (by a Wild Barbazzoop), and Ticklish Tom (who unfortunately giggles his way onto a railroad track). Small matters, surely, but good to know when you're reading something to your child that's slightly over their head in terms of age-appropriateness. It's nice to be prepared for the moment just after you've finished reading, and your little one turns to you and says, ""Mommy, what's kidnapping?""",14,1 comment

30118,A Light in the Attic,Stephen,"1,517",10800,4,"July 29, 2010",4.0 to 4.5 stars. One of those books that can be enjoyed by children and adults depending on how deeply you dive into the meaning of the stories. Incredibly imaginative and very well done. ,13,N/A
30118,A Light in the Attic,Jerry,"4,616",54,4,"July 26, 2020","I was introduced to the works of Shel Silverstein when my fourth grade teacher read Where the Sidewalk Ends to my class. Sadly, the author passed away not long after I discovered his poetry; still, he lives on thanks to his timeless works. This book has some crazy poems; between the zany words and hilarious illustrations, kids and even some adults are sure to laugh. Occasionally, the poems were crude, but only in a ""PG"" way. While I was disappointed when I found out about Mr. Silverstein's lifestyle--and, if you check out his Wikipedia page, you'll see why--that doesn't reflect on this book.",12,N/A
30118,A Light in the Attic,Gauri,236,6,4,"December 16, 2016","I read a little bit from this book everyday to my younger brother this past week. I can't remember if I finished this myself in my own childhood, but it felt like I read it for the first time, so I'll put this in the list of books I read this year. This is a book full of poems about jokes or about little lessons presented in comical ways. It gets little kids thinking and gets them interested about deeper thinking. Definitely a must-read for children!",12,7
30118,A Light in the Attic,Amber J,850,52,5,"January 4, 2022","This was one of my favorite books as a child, and I loved being able to read it again. Even more so I got to read it to my 7 year old daughter and some to my 10 year old nephew. They both loved it. They laughed at most of them and my daughter commented about it being sad when it was a sad poem. I got two more of his books from the library and I'm very excited to read them for both myself and my daughter.",12,N/A
30118,A Light in the Attic,Ammara Abid,205,138,4,"December 5, 2016","Absolutely brilliant. Every time I read it, every time I love it more. Many poems are my favorite, I can't write all of them here but couldn't resist myself sharing these two,The Nailbiter Some people manicure their nails, Some people trim them neatly, Some people keep them filed down, I bite ‚Äôem off completely. Yes, it‚Äôs a nasty habit, butBefore you start to scold,Remember, I have never ever Scratched a single soul.Zebra QuestionI asked the zebraAre you black with white stripes?Or white with black stripes?And the zebra asked me,Are you good with bad habits?Or are you bad with good habits?Are you noisy with quiet times?Or are you quiet with noisy times?Are you happy with some sad days?Or are you sad with some happy days?Are you neat with some sloppy ways?Or are you sloppy with some neat ways?And on and on and on and onAnd on and on he went.I'll never ask a zebraAbout stripesAgain.",10,N/A
