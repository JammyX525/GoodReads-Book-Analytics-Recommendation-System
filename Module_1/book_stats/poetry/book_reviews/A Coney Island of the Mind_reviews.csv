99713,A Coney Island of the Mind,Theo Logos,586,88,5,"January 15, 2023","Lawrence Ferlinghetti, man! The dude’s NAME is a poem! He would sling and he would sing images and words that buzz and hum through your head and electrify your heart. He could drop a phrase that was a poem by itself -In a surrealist year of sandwichmen and sunbathersCat, that line right there is the Most! The rest of the poem is nearly superfluous. Or he could give you new rhythms to old songs, fresh eyes to reveal hidden blasphemies -Sometime during eternitysome guys show upand one of themwho shows up real lateis a kind of carpenterfrom some square-type placelike Galilee and he starts wailingand claiming he is hipto who made heaven and earthand that the catwho really laid it on usis his DadAnd then, mid volume, he syncopates, with Oral Messages, poems written for experimental reading to jazz accompaniment -I am waiting for the Second Comingand I am waiting for a religious revival to sweep thru the state of Arizona and I am waiting for the Grapes of Wrath to be storedand I am waiting for them to prove that God is really American and I am seriously waiting for Billy Graham and Elvis Presley to exchange roles seriouslyThis is high test fuel, Baby! Vintage poetic wine as intoxicating now as when first written. Dig it!",29,8
99713,A Coney Island of the Mind,Maureen,726,85,4,"February 12, 2011","In looking at the book page for this book, I am struck by how many people chose to include one of Ferlinghetti's poems. In my opinion, what that says is that although some of the slanguage and cultural references may be a bit dated, these poems still resonate with people, me included. I bought my copy of this book at City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, sat, and read it from cover to cover. Almost everyone who reads this book will find a poem that will stay with them a long, long time.",27,N/A

I truly liked this much more than I do Ginsburg. I felt it aligning itself in step with O'Hara perhaps, a parallel solidity. As was the case with our sojourn to the Deep South I read this with an ear for Race. The time of its publication is close to when James Baldwin returned from exile, to pay his dues. (1955)I liked Ferlinghetti's images, his reworking of Christian mythos. The interplay with redemption and Santa Claus. There's an urgency about being-in-a-place. An understanding which places Baldwin and Heidegger side by side in earnest contemplation.",18,N/A

99713,A Coney Island of the Mind,Erik Graff,"4,983",1082,3,"July 2, 2009","Throughout much of my youth I bore fealty to a single woman. In junior high it was Nancy, half a foot taller than me, she of the checked skirts. In high school and into college it was Rachel, artist, fabricator of her own clothing, the girl down the block. Nothing came of these relationships in the ordinary sense. We were friends, but the passion wasn't reciprocated. I never really expected it would be.Rachel had a custom during my last two years of secondary school of having folks over for Constant Comment tea on her parent's front porch when the weather was good. The group was never very large as it normally only included those of us who would walk home together when classes were done. It did not include my older, political friends, some of whom were already in college. It did include some of those who were our suburb's counter-culture: pseudo-hippies, psuedo-beats, though we never used those terms, preferring ""freaks"" if anything.I was loaned a copy of Ferlinghetti's poems on that porch one fine spring day shortly before graduation. Previously I'd only read a bit of Ginsberg, a poet who attracted both the artistic and the political types. Ferlinghetti was just a name to me, a representative of the older generations, a representative of the Beats.Frankly, I wasn't much impressed, not like I had been with Ginsberg, not like I wss with the more conventional, and usually philosophic and/or romantic, poets we read in school.I left Rachel and Park Ridge for college that late summer, staying faithful to the romantic ideal of her until another girl, a virtual stranger, contrived to impose her own romantic ideal and have her way with me. It was disappointing and I felt it an act of betrayal on my part. Rachel, presumably, was relieved.This all comes back, incidentally, because I'm at the home of one of these old friends, the old, familial home in Park Ridge. His mother just died and I'm ostensibly helping him organize the house for potential sale. Ferlinghetti was in his room along with other memories.",7,4
99713,A Coney Island of the Mind,Matt,"1,010",644,4,"August 23, 2019","A slightly different take of mine about this book: https://thebaffler.com/latest/to-real...Every bookish malcontent in the world gets all hot and bothered by the Beats, and that's fine, of course, but Lawrence Ferlinghetti is one of the major poets of the movement and he gets overlooked quite often. In fact, there's a moment in this documentary I saw on him where he's at his 70th birthday or something and he's chatting with Gregory Corso. Corso's all shabby and grungy and resentful, a bitter minor voice if there ever was one, and he says something to Ferlinghetti to the effect of ""Jack and Allen got famous, we didn't!"" Which is of course, true, at least in a commercial sense, not to mention posterity.Ferlinghetti nods and responds with admirable poise and grace: ""I know. I don't mind.""What a classy guy. And the poems in this book are really really good. His learning and mastery of technique are there if you look for them, but his voice is broad and his meter is free. Also, compared to the guilt-ridden Kerouac and the notoriously orgiastic Ginsberg (not to mention the lurid Burroughs) Ferlinghetti is more of a man on the street, a fella you could drink absinthe with, and takes pleasure in the senses and the life force and has his political radicalism and eats it too. Highly recommended, especially for people who are hep to the Beat jive but need to be given a wider perspective. Also the lack of pretentiousness and lyrical frankness is charming and nourishing. If you have the chance to listen to him read aloud, on a recording or youtube or something, please do so.",6,N/A

99713,A Coney Island of the Mind,Dan,"1,057",52,5,"November 5, 2022",This was objectively an excellent book of poetry. The poems 'I am Waiting' and 'Autobiography' in particular are real treasures while the poems in the rest of the collection are all relatable and many are also quite good. I read a prose book years ago by Ferlinghetti and did not like it but I'm glad that I didn't give up on him as he is a fine poet. 5 stars,4,N/A

99713,A Coney Island of the Mind,Miriam Cihodariu,576,113,5,"February 5, 2018","I would give this a 4.5 stars but for lack of half-measures I will settle for 5. Still, this means I really loved it. I don't usually rate things so high. It's a beautiful, gorgeous madness with nothing of random musings in it. Instead, in spite of the random appearance of this madness, everything is horrifyingly meaningful. Best parts:it's full of references (that actually make sense) to many cultural landmarks, sensitive, insightful, full of that mandatory drunkenness (on life) which seeps into all (good) poetry.Not so awesome parts: some repetitive images, and the fact that the contempt for middle class values, in my opinion, is really getting old. At least when it's explicit (as it tends to be here). My favorite:I have not lain with beauty all my lifetelling over myselfits most rife charmsI have not lain with beauty all my lifeand lied with it as welltelling over to myselfhow beauty never diesbut lies apartamong the aboriginesof artand far above the battlefieldsof loveIt is above all thatoh yesIt sits upoin the chiocest ofChurch seatsup there where art directors meetto choose the things for immortalityAnd they have lain with beautyall their livesAnd they have fed on honeydewand drunk the wines of Paradiseso that they known exactly howa thing of beauty is a joyforever and foreverand how it never neverquite can fadeinto a money-losing nothingnessOh no I have not lainon Beauty Rests like thisafraid to rise at nightfor fear that I might somehow misssome movement beauty might have madeYet I have slept with beautyin my own weird wayand I have made a hungry scene or twowith beauty in my bedand so spilled out another poem or twoupon the Bosch-like world.",3,N/A
