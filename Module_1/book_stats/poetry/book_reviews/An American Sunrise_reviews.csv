43726586,An American Sunrise,Diane S ☔,"4,686",1400,4,"January 23, 2020","There is nothing quite like poetry to give balm to ones soul. Thoughts, feelings, praises, regret, hopes, dreams told with few words but great emotion. Here, the US poet Laurete, Jo Harjo returns to her native land and in a series of works honors what was, what was lost, taken away and what will never come again. The poems are beautiful, regretful and bittersweet, but most of assessible to all readers, lovers of poetry or not.The piece I'm quoting is part of a longer work, but this section called out to me.""4. WestSunsets, bringDarkness,Brings black. We find solitude,Time to take in breathe and Pray.Even in darkness youCan be found. Call out even in a whisperOf wimper,You will be heard.To find,To be found,To be understood,To be seen,Heard, felt.You are,Breath.You are, Memory.You areTouch.You are,Right here.""",99,20
43726586,An American Sunrise,Brina,873,4,4,"August 30, 2019","Joy Harjo has been named the new US Poet Laureate in 2019, becoming the first Native American to hold the position. American Sunrise is her first published work since becoming the top poet in the United States, and, as with other collections of hers that I have read, she does not disappoint here. This new volume pays homage to her ancestors who traveled the Trail of Tears. Her spiritual grandfather Monawee has been able to travel beyond the boundaries of time and visit members of his tribe and blessing them with good tidings. Harjo talks of Monawee as well as her aunts, uncles, and grandparents, noting that she and her grandmother share a love of the saxophone, both being above average musicians. After reading Harjo’s memoir Crazy Brave earlier this year, her poetry does not seem as powerful to me because I am now familiar with its backstory. Yet, the prose is still poignant, and Harjo interjects the poems with historical anecdotes of the Cherokee Trail of Tears and how her Ocmulgee people have gotten to where they are today. Now that Harjo is the US Poet Laureate, I look forward to upcoming expressive work of hers. She has been a prominent poet for years now, and is much deserving of this honor. 4 stars ",66,4
43726586,An American Sunrise,Sarah,335,95,4,"November 24, 2022","This collection is short, and I chose the audiobook because it’s read by the author. I won’t analyze each offering, but I would like to share a brief, illustrative story about one poem called Washing My Mother's Body. I listened to this poem, which is fairly long, without much emotion as I drove to pick up dinner. I heard the words, but I didn’t realize how deep they were hitting until I got a strong urge to call my mother. For some reason, I tried telling her about the poem, and I got exactly three words into my sentence before crumbling into tears, after which I blubbered something like: “She’s washing her body… *sob*… and it turns into a sort of prayer… *snot*… and she’s just remembering…and thanking her mother for…*sniffle*… all the sacrifices she made… and saying goodbye… 
  and mom, you need to keep living for a long time, okay?!”
My mother was quiet for a moment, then I heard a small whimper on her end of the line, and then she inexplicably switched gears, drove us to safer terrain, “You know,” she said, “they used to wash bodies in our family, and not too long ago. My grandmother did it. You had to, because there weren’t any embalmers way out in the country and you just buried your own dead.” She continued her history lesson a while, talking much faster than usual, and then she blurted out directions to cremate herself and my father when they pass, “And we don’t care what you do with the ashes. We’ll be gone, so just do what you want. We don't even need a funeral, really.” Strange, huh? From tender tears to stone cold last wishes in under a minute. I’m sharing this because Harjo’s collection unfolds in a manner similar to my conversation with my mother. It gets very emotional for a poem or two, then switches to a history lesson, then it gets sexy, then it shares truths about the white man (""We were called heathen/But who is the heathen here/And when a people strips your spirit of your body/And sells your red skins for bounty/Then they are the ones who have broken the law.""), then there are poems of hopelessness mixed with anger and plans of action at the local bar, then a bedazzling origin story, then a trickster tale, then a series of wisdom psalms (some of which the author really does sing, to my delight), then something funny, then another tear-jerker...Life is like that, I guess. A mixed bag that never holds still long enough for us to get to the bottom of one emotion before another rises to the fore. This is my first Joy Harjo book, though I did watch her Masterclass prior to reading it. I'm already eager to read another. 
  All memory bends to fit. We become poems.

43726586,An American Sunrise,Jennifer Welsh,208,147,3,"December 4, 2020","Some nice cross-pollination between this and her memoir, Crazy Brave. I chose the audible version in which Harjo reads her own work. Lovely voice. Except when she sings. Her poetry is informative; it very organically paints a portrait of Native American culture and experience. But her poetry is ok. I liked it more as I listened, and then by the end I was tired of it. Still, I enjoyed the experience of learning through her, and the two books together supported the learning of that experience.",52,13

  Singing Everything
by Joy HarjoOnce there were songs for everything,Songs for planting, for growing, for harvesting,For eating, getting drunk, falling asleep,For sunrise, birth, mind-break, and war.For death (those are the heaviest songs and theyHave to be pried from the earth with shovels of grief).Now all we hear are falling-in-love songs andFalling apart after falling in love songs.The earth is leaning sidewaysAnd a song is emerging from the floodsAnd fires. Urgent tendrils lift toward the sun.You must be friends with silence to hear.The songs of the guardians of silence are the most powerful ---They are the most rare.",41,N/A
43726586,An American Sunrise,Linda,"1,166",1213,4,"January 20, 2022","Within intense misfortunes and cruel injustices, the seeds of blessings grow. And we have been blessed with the heart and mind of Joy Harjo, Poet Laurete of the United States in 2019. You can't be a voice for a people unless you have immersed yourself in the walk-through of suffering, desperation, joyless moments, and the elements of want. And you can't be a voice for a people unless you have touched the threads of happiness, determination, and the soft murmur of satisfaction. Harjo does know.....Respect lies in the acknowledgement of all Native American Nations across this land. Harjo speaks in the tones of the beginnings of the Mvskoke originally east of the Mississippi River. But in these things, the lines fade and then take on unstable shapes and forms. But the tribal histories remain steadfast in the remembering past down from generation to generation. History, in its cruelties, remains rock solid in the bones. To be ""removed"", in no uncertain terms, does not squander the source of ""being"" found in spirit and truth.Joy Harjo is a superb storyteller traveling the current of her poetry. Her words can be brutal, revealing, and smack-you-in-the-face raw. And at the same time, Harjo can be tender and can leave deep furrows in the heart with ""Washing My Mother's Body"":""I step in to make my ritual. To do what should have been done, what needs to be fixed so that my spirit can move on,So that the children and the grandchildren are not caught up in a knotOf regret they do not understand.""An American Sunrise is also a theme of hope. That we see with the eyes of the soul rather than with the eyes of indifference. Indifference is the cruelest of all. Let me leave you with this: ""Every increment of any thought, action, or deed matters, has consequences in all directions.""""There will be no balance without all voices present in the power circle.""",39,14

43726586,An American Sunrise,Kevin,463,68,3,"December 19, 2022","I was born and raised in the Mvskoke nation of Oklahoma. In those days, we always referred to it as the “Creek” nation, a moniker assigned to Mvskokes by white immigrants. While I myself have no native american ancestry, I grew up immersed in pow wow country and surrounded by Mvskoke (and Seminole, and Cherokee, and Choctaw) friends. In Mvskoke-land, Harjos are everywhere. The surname is about as common as caucasian “Smith.” I say this because seeing the name Harjo associated with the title ‘Poet Laureate’ gives me a bit of nostalgic homeboy pride. It is my distinction by association. It is my prestige by proxy.I absolutely love Joy Harjo. As a representative of indigenous peoples (and Oklahoma) I love what she brings to the table. She is more than a poet, she is a force of nature. But, and here is where I turn from socialite to troglodyte, I like-NOT-love poetry. I’ll take good prose over great poetry every time. Langston Hughes, Sylvia Plath, Virginia Woolf… I like their poetry, but I LOVE The Ways of White Folks and The Bell Jar and A Room of One’s Own. Respectively and respectfully.I’m off to read Poet Warrior.*For more insight into Mvskoke-Land, check out the FX series Reservation Dogs written and directed by Sterlin HARJO.",12,N/A
43726586,An American Sunrise,Deborah,731,47,4,"October 6, 2019","Named the Poet Laureate of the United States in 2019, Joy Harjo has written a collection of poems honoring her tribal history, her mother, ancestors, singing, remembrance, exile, saxophone, spirituality, and much more. In 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act. Her tribal ancestors of Muscogees (Mvskokes) were ousted from their homes and lands in Alabama, forced to abandon their lives and possessions, and trudged a Trail of Tears to the Oklahoma Territory. I was surprised to learn that it was illegal for native persons of the U.S. to practice religious, spiritual, and cultural rituals until the Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 was enacted. She returned to where her people were ousted. She explores the “destruction and disrespect” of the native sovereign nations. Not only is she the first Native American Poet Laureate, she is an author of books, poetry, and plays and a musician. Some selections:“I was taught to give honor to the house of warriors Which cannot exist without the house of the peacemakers.”(From The Fight)“He knew one day, far day, the grandchildren would return, generations later over slick highways, constructed over old trails Through walls of laws meant to hamper or destroy, over stones bearing libraries of the winds.He sang us back to our home place from which we were stolen in these smoky green hills.”(From How to Write a Poem in a Time of War)“I am a star falling from the night skyI need you to catch me I am a rainbow lifting from a dark cloudI need you to see me”(from Falling from the Night Sky)My favorite poems were Washing My Mother’s Body, Singing Everything; For Those Who Govern; and Advice for Countries, Advanced, Developing and Falling.",11,N/A

43726586,An American Sunrise,Judy,"1,640",269,5,"November 17, 2021","I have been reading these poems by Native American Poet Laureate Joy Harjo over the past month. The collection is a perfect companion to her memoir, Poet Warrior.I am a mere beginner when it comes to reading poetry. I began reading a poem a day in 2016 with Mary Oliver's A Thousand Mornings. I have learned that just as there are many ways to tell a story in fiction, there are many ways to write a poem. With some poems I can get pretty close to what they are about. Others confound me. I usually read poems aloud because I feel I connect better that way.Joy Harjo's poems just went right to my heart and mind. Having read her memoir I already had the background on her life and the lives of her family and ancestors, the sad and shameful tale of the Trail of Tears, when her Muscogee ancestors were forcibly removed from their lands in Arkansas and marched to barren lands in Oklahoma, the struggles of her people to find their places in American life.The poems, some of which are prose poems, some free verse, some influenced by Native American songs and rites, sing with truth and even hope. Not just hope for Native Americans but also for all of us that we can reconnect to the land and plants and creatures. Though all peoples of the world carry violence and war in our make up, Joy is essentially a pacifist. Thus she speaks to her own people but to all of us with her plea for living in harmony with our environment and each other.She reminds me that it is both possible and essential that such ideas be entered into human consciousness by way of words and music and action.",9,4

In 1830 Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, forcing indigenous peoples out of the southeastern United States. Harjo’s family were force-marched from current-day Alabama to Oklahoma. This collection takes that Trail of Tears as a backbone, interweaving experiences from Harjo’s own life and politics, as well as relationships with the natural world, family, and those around her. I was grateful to learn something of the (shameful) historical context - Harjo intersperses stories from her own family as well as excerpts from oral history of the time. Among the poems, I found Washing My Mother’s Body especially moving.",7,3
