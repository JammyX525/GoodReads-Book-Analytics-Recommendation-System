1294681,And Still I Rise,Brina,873,4,4,"March 19, 2019","Still I Rise is Maya Angelou’s encouragement to women of color everywhere that yes they can achieve great things. These words reach for the heights and that is what every person should do, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or social standing. It is easy for women of color to think that the world is not designed for people that look like them to dream big, but that is exactly what Angelou’s signature poem does. Entwined with the artwork of Diego Rivera, all that is missing is improvisational jazz and the work would be complete. A necessary reminder for women to hear during women’s history month. 4.5 stars ",79,9
1294681,And Still I Rise,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"August 20, 2021","And Still I Rise, Maya AngelouAnd Still I Rise is author Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, published by Random House in 1978. It was published during one of the most productive periods in Angelou's career; she had written three autobiographies and published two other volumes of poetry up to that point. Angelou considered herself a poet and a playwright, but was best known for her seven autobiographies, especially her first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, although her poetry has also been successful. She began, early in her writing career, alternating the publication of an autobiography and a volume of poetry. Although her poetry collections have been best-sellers, they have not received serious critical attention.And Still I Rise consists of 32 poems, divided into three parts:Part One: Touch Me, Life, Not SoftlyA Kind of Love, Some Say,Country Lover,Remembrance,Where We Belong, A Duet,Phenomenal Woman,Men,Refusal,and Just for a Time.Part Two: TravelingJunkie Monkey Reel,The Lesson,California Prodigal,My Arkansas,Through the Inner City to the Suburbs,Lady Luncheon Club,Momma Welfare Roll,The Singer Will Not Sing,Willie,To Beat the Child Was Bad Enough,Woman Work,One More Round,The Traveler,Kin,and The Memory.Part Three: And Still I RiseStill I Rise,Ain't That Bad?,Life Doesn't Frighten Me,Bump d'Bump,On Aging,In Retrospect,Just Like Job,Call Letters: Mrs. V.

1294681,And Still I Rise,Bionic Jean,"1,212",999,4,"July 26, 2021","Maya Angelou is an inspirational figure, admired the world over for her sensitivity, passion, and advocacy of black rights; she was a vigorous activist, especially with regard to women. The world lost a remarkable influential figure when she died. So what is her poetry actually like? The word ""inspirational"" is bandied around today to include all sort of cant and twaddle. I must admit to being apprehensive at the start. Although by the time this collection had been published, Maya Angelou had received over thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities all over the world, there is a lurking suspicion that this is for the person herself; her overcoming of almost unimaginable hardships, plus her achievements in society and the legislative progress, rather than strictly academic prowess. After all, her poetry is thought to be populist, and has not received much serious critical attention. Would Maya Angelou's poetry turn out to be over-simplistic rhetoric, or sanctimonious versifying? Thankfully, the answer is no. The poems match the figurehead. She does speak to the people; she speaks to aspects of humanity we all have within us. There is diversity; much variation of mood and style. Sometimes the language used is direct and repetitive. Her much-lauded ""Phenomenal Woman"", ""Woman Work"" and the title poem for this collection, ""And Still I Rise"" all conform to this type. These are accessible to those who may not regularly read poetry. Many women have felt a personal connection, or significance, saying that one such poem speaks to them - that it is their own experience. ""And Still I Rise"" has been called an anthem for the entire black race. But some poems are significantly darker and embittered. Some have more variant forms, jerky spasmodic rhythms, elusive and sensual language. Some are pain-filled, some outrageous. Some are filled with despair. These are not all ""feel-good"" poems by any means. And they are not always ""easy"" to read, in any sense of the word.The collection And Still I Rise is Maya Angelou's third volume of poetry, and was first published in 1978. Angelou was well into her stride as a writer by now. As well as the two former volumes of poetry, she had also written three of her autobiographies; she tended to alternate between the two. This collections is made up of 32 short poems, and is divided into three parts. 1. Touch Me, Life, Not Softly2. Travelling3. And Still I RiseIn the very first poem we are confronted with cruelty and abuse,""Hate often is confused. ItsLimits are in zones beyond itself ...""The dark theme is mirrored by a spiky, disjointed structure. The next two poems describe the experience of black youth, giddy, earthy and sensual. The next begins with feeling of isolation, loneliness in the crowds, ""I searched the facesHoping to findSomeone to care""  but ends with connection,""I've never been so strong, Now I'm where I belong""It is noticeable that Angelou's rhymes are often in rhythmic couplets, and come either as a refrain, or at the end of a poem, where she wants to add extra emphasis. The following poem ""Phenomenal Woman"" is an example of an even more spare exaggeration, where the author plays with the word ""phenomenal"", and the whole poem has a bouncy, upbeat and playful rhythm. It is a poem of self-assertion and humour. I have reviewed this poem separately link here, in a different edition.But the optimism does not last long. With the next poem, ""Men"" the reader is back to youth, entrapment, fear and oppression,""... The hurt begins,Wrench out a Smile that slides aroundthe fear ...""And we are also back to the dislocation of words.The final two poems in this section speak of early love, memory and regret.The readers may wonder whether perhaps the middle section will become more optimistic, but no. It starts with ""Junkie Monkey Reel"", a dark description of a drug addict; with raw painful images. ""The Lesson"" continues the theme about the selfishness and ultimate self-destruction of drug addiction, ""Rotting flesh and worms doNot convince me againstThe challenge. The yearsAnd cold defeat live deep inLines along my face.They dull my eyes, yetI keep on dying,Because I love to live."" The next poem, ""California Prodigal"", is perhaps the most difficult in the collection. A description of the California landscape using metaphor and personification of the rugged natural formations, a description of an old adobe house up in the mountains; a quiet, peaceful place to conjure up a sense of loss and abandonment,""Flush on inner cottage walls Antiquitous faces,Used to the gelid breathOf old manors, glare disdainfully Over breached time.Around and through these Cold phantasmatalities, He walks,""But the poem ends on an optimistic note describing the sunlit poppy fields,""...Each day isFulminant, exploding brightly""""My Arkansas"" is also a dark poem, referring back to Angelou's childhood, and the racism prevalent at that time. The poem is full of symbolism such as the moss which represents the ""old crimes"" of Arkansas, spoiling the poplar trees on which it grows. Many aspects of nature are used here as symbols for events. For instance, red universally symbolises danger, whereas a sunrise is usually an indication of hope. Yet with, ""dusk no more shadowsthan the noon The past is brighter yet"" the reader wonders how strong the hope really is. Will the new dawn for Arkansas ever come? The memories remain, festering,""It writhes. It writhes in awfulWaves of brooding.""The next poem provides glimpses, vivid shapshots of a city, always with a dark feel.""Lady Luncheon Club"" is simpler; direct and ironic. It recalls every impassioned after-dinner speech the reader may have encountered, and the trivialities of the ""chattering classes"" who may be in attendance,""He sighs for youthful deathAnd rape at ten, and murder ofThe soul stretched over long.Our woman notes:(This coffee’s much too strong.)""The poem has humour, but it is a grim twisted humour.The next, ""Momma Welfare Roll"", is also bitter. Angelou often writes about women who have few life choices left. In this one, a mother is forced to accept government assistance, to go ""on welfare"". She is described as courageous and defiant,""Her jowls shiver in accusationOf crimes cliched by Repetition ...""...""Too fat to whoreToo mad to work""...""They don't give me welfare.I take it.""""The Singer Will Not Sing"" is probably meant for Angelou's friend, the singer, Abbey Lincoln, since it was written at a time when the singer was not producing much, and this is what is described,""Sounds do not lift beyondthose reddened walls.""""Willie"" is a hauntingly beautiful and sad poem, about a lonely tramp,""Solitude was the climate in his headEmptiness was the partner in his bed,Pain echoed in the steps of his tread,""...""I may cry and I will die,But my spirit is the soul of every spring,""...""I'm the rustle in the autumn leaves.""It is clearly an allegory, and a very positive, uplifting one. Willie is crippled, yet after he dies he will live on in many different ways. This is my personal favourite.""To Beat The Child Was Bad Enough"" is an emotional description of a new birth, as it must feel to the child,""Hunger, new hands, strange voices,Its cry came natural, tearing.""""Woman Work"", lists the mundane chores of a woman who stays at home to mother her children. It has a strong rhyme scheme, an almost singing tone in its forceful rhythms and chants. The theme of women's vitality here is similar to that of ""Phenomenal Woman"", and its positivity will appeal to readers to whom this lifestyle feels familiar. The end indicates the world outside, a world of peace and contentment, and an ""other"" aspect of the world that the working woman of the poem craves, and feels she deserves, ""Fall gently, snowflakesCover me with whiteCold icy kisses andLet me rest tonight.Sun, rain, curving skyMountain, oceans, leaf and stoneStar shine, moon glowYou're all that I can call my own.""It is followed by the very popular poem, one which begs to be said aloud, ""One More Round"",""There ain't no pay beneath the sunAs sweet as rest when a job's well done.""The strong metre and rhythm echo the plantation songs, the work and protest songs from earlier eras, and the theme is against oppression and past slavery,""And now I'll tell you my Golden Rule,I was born to work but I ain't no muleI was born to work up to my graveBut I was not bornTo be a slave.""The final three poems in the middle section deal with the racial injustices of the past, the poverty of Maya Angelou's Arkansas childhood, the drudgery of life working in the cotton rows and the sugar cane,""And all my days are dying.""The third section start with the masterpiece ""Still I Rise"", and straightaway there are the vociferous accusations from an oppressed race, the injustice of misrepresentation which is in the very written record, ""You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may tread me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise.""It is a proud and defiant statement,""You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise.""There is a hopeful determination to rise above difficulty and discouragement, a determination to be strong and resiliant, referring back again to the earlier times of slavery,""Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise""Ending with a timeless and triumphant dream, a determined declaration,""Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise I rise I rise."" The next, ""Ain't That Bad?"" is a rare jocular poem to encourage Black Pride, using ""bad"" in the street vernacular, to convey positive connections with Black culture and mores,""Dressing in purples and pinks and greensExotic as rum and cokes,""conjures up an image of street cred, the strength and pride in being Black and observing the customs and community,""An' ain't we BlackAn' ain't we fine?""""Life doesn't frighten me at all"" continues the positive, more upbeat and defiant feeling, as does ""Bump d'Bump"". ""On Aging"" continues the provocation with skill and sensitivity, with instantly recognisable thoughts for those to whom it applies,""Don't think I need your chattering.I'm listening to myself.""Plus there is an acceptance of fate and time, a resolution, and a quirky sense of humour,""But aint' I lucky I can still breathe in.""There is a brief return to the themes of nature and love, the progress of life, and two poems which are a commitment to Maya Angelou's faith in her Christian God, with a refrain,""Let me humbly say,Thank You for this dayI want to thank You."" This collection of poems is a very personal collection. Maya Angelou's experience of life could hardly be much more different from my own. So how do they make me feel as a white person? Do I feel guilty for the crimes of my ancestors? No. I feel outraged, angry, and deeply saddened. But it is Maya Angelou's skill as a poet which makes me feel I have far more in common with her, as a fellow human from a totally different culture, with totally different experiences, than I have with anyone involved with the centuries of oppression and mistreatment of black people in the past.Maya Angelou speaks out and gives a voice to all black people, all people (especially women) who have ever been oppressed, and all her ancestors. With her indomitable spirit, she speaks out for the poor, the disenfranchised, the deprived, and the handicapped. She addresses both the basic human spirit, and social issues. The poems cover a wide range of topics, including themes here of painful loss, sexual awakening, sensuality, self-acceptance, aging, the home, the importance of family, love, loneliness, drug addiction, Christian salvation, Springtime, social injustice, continuing discrimination, Southern racism, the struggles of slavery, segregation, sexism, the nature of women, rape and abuse, and perhaps most passionately, the strength of women's voices. Maya Angelou is concerned with survival, the right to a personal identity. She is darkly defiant, black, angry and bitter, wryly comical, wise and hopeful, self-assured and ultimately encouraging and resilient. She thinks life can be beautiful and full of joy, but that we all have a long way to go yet. The poems are a triumph. ""I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope of the slave. I rise I rise I rise."" Here is a list of all the poem in And Still I Rise:1.

There is so much obvious sadness in Maya Angelou, but still I feel freer and taller and stronger after reading a few of her poems. They grow with life as well. What did the poems about ageing have to do with me, when I first encountered her in my rebellious twenties? I only saw her take on women and racism and patriarchy and the aching pain of hearts broken and rebuilt and rising, rising, rising, not matter what!Now I smile at her stubborn refusal to get a rocking chair to rest the lungs that are hardly what they used to be... Maya, I want to say, a whole generation will need the rocking chair early because of our times and our curses. Lungs are not what they used to be. And still, we breathe...For those of you who want to feel sweetness in the inevitable sadness, ""And Still I Rise"" is just the book for you!",46,4

1294681,And Still I Rise,Veronique,"1,217",164,5,"July 29, 2020","Apart from her powerful poem 'Still I Rise’, which I love, I didn’t know much of Maya Angelou’s writing. This little anthology was therefore a timely discovery. While reading aloud, several adjectives came to my mind: raw, sensual, melancholic, vital, lonely, fierce, irreverent, etc. There was also a musicality to some of the poems, making me think they could easily be used as lyrics. The format too goes from the very short, not unlike haikus, to longer form with a more complex thread. A lot of them had this warmth, as if I could feel the sun beating on me, while others were shrouded in shadows. Some made me smile, but many left me lost in my thoughts...As you would expect, Angelou focuses on black lives, but also women’s lives and old age/experience, which surprised me. Her voice really came through her writing, so powerful and evocative. Many of these poems 'talked’ to me, as a woman, and as a person who has always been a foreigner wherever I’ve lived. I’ll finish with an extract from one of her poems, that really fits her: ""I’m a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That’s me.”",13,3

Reading Maya Angelou is great, but listening to her is better. I am always put into a better state of mind with her words. Dr. Angelou was one one of the great multi-talented writers of the 20th century as a playwright, poet, actress, and memiorist. Though her most celebrated work is her autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, she considered herself a poet first. She wrote over 11 volumes of poetry, but this may be her most famous volume. It contains some of her most quoted poems (including the title poem) and has been a consistently anthologized book. On AgingWhen you see me sitting quietly,Like a sack left on the shelf,Don’t think I need your chattering.I’m listening to myself.Hold! Stop! Don’t pity me!Hold! Stop your sympathy!Understanding if you got it,Otherwise I’ll do without it!When my bones are stiff and aching,And my feet won’t climb the stair,I will only ask one favor:Don’t bring me no rocking chair.When you see me walking, stumbling,Don’t study and get it wrong.‘Cause tired don’t mean lazyAnd every goodbye ain’t gone.I’m the same person I was back then,A little less hair, a little less chin,A lot less lungs and much less wind.But ain’t I lucky I can still breathe in.This audiobook is a bit of a mystery to me as it was recorded some time between the 1990s and the 2000s and only contains 13 of the 32 poems found in the actual printed book (leaving out--for instances--a poem like Phenomenal Woman). Still the poems included-in are great and we get to hear Dr. Angelou's great ability as a storyteller and reciter on full display. One bonus we do have is commentary in which she tells the story behind some of the poems and what she was aiming for or how she felt she missed the mark in one place so she included another poem to make-up for it.Ain't That BadDancin' the funky chickenEatin' ribs and tipsDiggin' all the latest soundsAnd drinkin' gin in sips.Puttin' down that do-ragTighten' up my 'froWrappin' up in BlacknessDon't I shine and glow?Hearin' Stevie WonderCookin' beans and riceGoin' to the operaCheckin' out Leontyne Price.Get down, Jesse JacksonDance on, Alvin AileyTalk, Miss Barbara JordanGroove, Miss Pearlie Bailey.Now ain't they bad?An ain't they Black?An ain't they Black?An' ain't they Bad?An ain't they bad?An' ain't they Black?An' ain't they fine?Black like the hour of the nightWhen your love turns and wriggles close to your sideBlack as the earth which has given birthTo nations, and when all else is gone will abide.Bad as the storm that leaps raging from the heavensBringing the welcome rainBad as the sun burning orange hot at middayLifting the waters again.Arthur Ashe on the tennis courtMohammed Ali in the ringAndre Watts and Andrew YoungBlack men doing their thing.Dressing in purples and pinks and greensExotic as rum and CokesLiving our lives with flash and styleAin't we colorful folks?Now ain't we bad?An' ain't we Black?An' ain't we Black?An' ain't we bad?An' ain't we bad?An' ain't we Black?An' ain't we fine?One of the reasons I was glad to have the audiobook was to have the poet's insight on the rhyme and rhythm of the poem. I think you can use meter to an extant when reading this book, but you gain a lot of priceless context in hearing how the poet imagines her piece to what the piece's meaning is. This book explores a lot of the inner life of people--their dignity in the face of hard times or good times. It is a volume of poetry that seems to come from an ancient place of the psyche, but a modern or everlasting message--at least to me.

1294681,And Still I Rise,David J,217,204,3,"December 14, 2019","Here I am, at 27, and finally getting around to Maya Angelou. I never had to read her work for school and somehow passed up reading I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings the many times I’ve seen it on my library’s shelves. Better late than never, right? And Still I Rise is Angelou’s third poetry collection, originally released in 1978. And for how much praise Angelou receives, I was surprised that I wasn’t bowled over by this collection. Yes, I definitely liked it but there was also something missing. And I can’t quite put my finger on it.There were many poems I did really enjoy: “Men,” “Refusal,” “The Lesson,” The Singer Will Not Sing, “Still I Rise,” and “In Retrospect.” There was a steady undercurrent of history, truth, and encouragement to these poems, as well as a critical yet uplifting look at womanhood and African American life. But for all of these wonderful poems, there was an equal amount that just didn’t do much for me. Perhaps I went in with too high of expectations, which is admittedly dumb since I hadn’t read any of Angelou’s work before this.These works are simple, but simple can be powerful. Some of these poems just didn't quite hit the mark for me, though. I’m still keen on reading more Angelou, don’t get me wrong. But I’m hoping her other work strikes me better than this collection.",11,N/A

It impressed me even more when I watched the YouTube clip of Angelou narrating the poem in her own style. The confident look on her face, the boldness in her moves, the determination in her voice totally left me off-guard. And then, I picked up this whole poetry collection, and OH BOY! It was astounding.Her writing is quirky in a way she tries to convey to the woman in genenal, racism and the struggle.

1294681,And Still I Rise,Neil R. Coulter,"1,045",97,4,"January 28, 2019","There are poems in this collection that I love, and some that I think are just okay. But what I love about Maya Angelou is her defiantly hopeful perspective on life in all its ups and downs.""Life doesn't frighten me at all / Not at all / Not at all"" (46).""I was born to work up to my grave / But I was not born / To be a slave"" (34).""I may be last in the welfare line / Below the rim where the sun don't shine / But getting up stays on my mind"" (47).""You said to lean on Your arm / And I'm leaning / You said to trust in Your love / And I'm trusting / You said to call on Your name / And I'm calling / I'm stepping out on Your word"" (50–51).""I want to thank you, Lord / For life and all that's in it. / Thank you for the day / And for the hour and for the minute. / I know many are gone, / I'm still living on, / I want to thank You"" (53).And of course all of the title poem itself, which is fantastic.I love how she can see the suffering and disappointment of her life and life itself, and yet laugh at it and defy it. I hope I can have that kind of strength in my own life. Her laughter and perceptiveness make me laugh—especially in a poem like ""Lady Luncheon Club."" And in a lot of her poems, there's a wonderful ambiguity in whether she's talking about a person, a personification of an idea, her own life, someone else's life, or simply a universal cry to God.
