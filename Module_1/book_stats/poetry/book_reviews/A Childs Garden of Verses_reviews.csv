20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",932,17600,5,"January 29, 2023","All by myself I have to goWith none to tell me what to do -All alone beside the streamsAnd up the mountainsides of dreams.A Child's Garden of VersesI remember my little friend, Gwennie, from back in 1953 when I think of this book. Her dad and mom lived beside our house on the East side of it - and my Mom used to declare that Gwennie's dad, Herb, was ""the most brilliant man I've ever known."" Be that as it may, we two tots had full open access to acre upon acre of grassland - home to a vast variety of insects... And Tadpoles.Tadpoles, infant frogs, thrived in the stagnant water of the ponds in that grassland. We kids wanted to see them grow in jars in our bedrooms, which of course, they never did.The point I'm trying to make is that kids in the post-war years were largely left unsupervised and unconstrained, across a laissez-faire North America!""With none to tell us what to do...""And, of course we grew up absurd, misfits in an affluent society. We really missed the little things of life when they packed up and left, at the onset of affluence.Is it any wonder that A Child's Garden of Verses was a prime source for the kids' story time at City View Public School? Mrs Stephens used to love to recite it to us 9-year-olds, later on. RLS's verse resounded in my head too, when at 10, I had my tonsils removed!It followed me as far as to the regimented absurdity of high school, where it was lost. Forever?Well, at least we kids seemed in our own eyes to never have fallen from Grace -How could we have?God was right there, under that vast cloud-spotted, blue-canopied City View Sky:And He never told us what to do and not to do!",67,6
20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,Cecily,"1,094",3831,5,"January 27, 2019","""Everything was grey. There wasn't any colour. It was all up to my imagination.”Brian Wildsmith, artist, on his childhood.Image: Summer SunThis review is an excuse to share some of the startling and colourful illustrations that Wildsmith crafted for this 1966 edition (words here). A truly wild smith. I can’t imagine what Robert Louis Stevenson would make of them, but I hope he would appreciate the edge they give to his words.Image: The CowThe poem leaves me cold, but the happy cow in her bucolic meadow, I love. The poems are mostly delightful. Many are familiar from repetition in my childhood, then to my child. We had plenty of other books of rhymes, but it was primarily the extravagant illustrations that drew me repeatedly to the pages, and the words I learned so well.Image: The Land of the CounterpaneI think this made me something of a hypochondriac as a child - though I’m quite the reverse as an adult.When I’ve seen modern editions, they’re invariably illustrated with competent, sometimes lovely pictures, but they're safe and predictable. Just what you expect for a cosy Victorian classic. Image: Armies in the FireI loved pareidolia long before I knew there was a word for it; perhaps this is why?I think the dissonance of Wildsmith’s pictures and Stevenson's verses add the vibrant joy and confusing kaleidoscope of childhood, and sometimes add modern relevance to the words themselves.Image: Whole Duty of ChildrenA dry Victorian instruction with a subversive twist.The child is always clearly recognisable, a character to identify with, but the backgrounds are often more abstract. There are echoes of Klimt, Turner, Miro, and Matisse, yet they are very much Wildsmith’s own.Image: Looking-Glass RiverAn example where the words do little for me, but the picture is lush.My FavouriteI was a tomboy, who loved cars, tractors, and trains. This was my favourite poem, and as an adult, I think the words, rhythm, and imagery are superb. You can't read it slowly, nor should you:Faster than fairies, faster than witches, Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches; And charging along like troops in a battle All through the meadows the horses and cattle: All of the sights of the hill and the plain Fly as thick as driving rain; And ever again, in the wink of an eye, Painted stations whistle by. Here is a child who clambers and scrambles, All by himself and gathering brambles; Here is a tramp who stands and gazes; And here is the green for stringing the daisies! Here is a cart run away in the road Lumping along with man and load; And here is a mill, and there is a river: Each a glimpse and gone forever!Image: From a Railway CarriageThen I went to Tate Britain for the first of many times (probably around seven years old) and saw this. The two are forever, happily, linked in my mind:Image: Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway, by JMW TurnerThe VersesSee Ted's excellent review, HERE, which is what prompted me to get out my copy and post this.

20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,1,"February 4, 2018"," A Child's Garden of Verses is a collection of poetry aimed at young children though due to the latent racism and views on British supremacy, I would not recommend it to a young impressionable reader. Robert Louis Stevenson was a very versatile writer; he delved deep into the human psyche when he wrote The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde but he did not restrict himself to representations of the gothic and the persecuted. He also wrote brilliant children's adventure stories such as Treasure Island and Kidnapped, but, again, he did not restrict himself to prose writing because here he demonstrates his ability to write poetry.In the fashion of William Blake's The Songs of Innocence and Experience, Stevenson's poetry has a certain deceptive quality. Like Blake's writing, it looks very simple on the surface. The style employed hides the nature of the poetry. The diction is very straight forward, but if you scratch the surface of the poetry and consider the meanings of the words in a wider context you will see exactly what I mean. It is very important to note the era in which Stevenson wrote these verses; he was a Victorian and as such there are some latent views regarding race that would be considered slightly risqué by today's standards.For example Stevenson celebrates British identity with an attempt at humour, though unfortunately it is at the expense at everything foreign. I would hesitate to recommend this book to children due to the nature of its representations of everything not British. Instead a more mature discerning reader is required to sieve through the falsities of Stevenson's representations, and to understand that he is not entirely to blame for them: he, like all the Victorians, wrote from a position of ignorance towards the east. They believed Britain Empire was the absolute apex of culture and society, everything else by comparison was lesser and underdeveloped. Their view of the world was distorted to say the least.This edition here if full of colourful illustrations that sit perfectly with the apparent simplicity of the poetry; it, certainly, is very pleasant to look upon. But, again, I would not put this in the hand of a child today because of the nature of some of the poems. A young reader could very easily absorb the information here, information that provides the views and opinions of a mind-set out of date and completely out of touch with the realities of Empire. This, in itself, is a real shame because there are some good pieces of poetry in here, but when Stevenson addresses the foreign he does so with the haughtiness and pomposity that came with his own literary era.",45,4

20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,Ted,515,744,5,"May 10, 2019","just got this book. I've read a few of the poems, but it really isn't for me.I'll soon be giving it to my daughter. It's for her daughter, my seven-year old granddaughter.It turns out that the youngster is currently enamored with poetry. Her bedtime reading of choice, her reading of choice period - meaning what she reads on her own.It's interesting. None of her family have that interest except me, and I only got the poetry bug a few years ago.Probably has to due with a poetry splurge by her teacher. Anyway, I'm sure she will love this book. . . . . . . . . . . .My review resulted from a look at a couple of A.A. Milne's books here on the site. And that resulted from This Day in History for Jan. 18, in which the birth of A.A. on that date in 1882 was indicated. This led to a mention by Goodreads of a similar book, the one being reviewed.Now, I can't be sure how much of this book I've read. I thought we once had it in the house, which my wife verified. But a search in all the likely places didn't turn it up.Well, Robert Louis Stevenson. Most noted for Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and A Child's Garden of Verses. To my memory, he is most noted for the epitaph that he wanted inscribed on his tomb.Under the wide and starry sky,Dig the grave and let me lie.Glad did I live and gladly die,And I laid me down with a will.This be the verse you grave for me:Here he lies where he longed to be;Home is the sailor, home from sea,And the hunter home from the hill.I no longer can be sure of why these words have lodged into my memory. I vaguely recollect that they were quoted as an epigraph in some short story (possibly a SF story) read long ago. Well a search on that turned up a story by Robert Heinlein called Requiem. It's the lead story in Famous Science Fiction Stories Adventures in Time and Space. My copy is a Modern Library Giant published in 1957. I might guess that I bought it and read that first story in high school. Thanks for the memory, Modern Library!The Stephenson thing isn't an epigraph. It's right up front in the story itself.On a high hill in Samoa there is a grave. Inscribed on the marker are these words:(…the Stephenson thing…)These lines appear another place – scrawled on a shipping tag torn from a compressed-air cylinder, and pinned to the ground with a knife.And away Heinlein goes.Stevenson went through a long period of decline in the 20th century. His Wiki article gives examples to document that he came to be judged a second-rate writer, to the extent that in the 1973 2,000-page Oxford Anthology of English Literature he was entirely unmentioned. Since then his reputation has rebounded quite a bit:The late 20th century brought a re-evaluation of Stevenson as an artist of great range and insight, a literary theorist, an essayist and social critic, a witness to the colonial history of the Pacific Islands, and a humanist. He was praised by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings, as a writer of a consistently high level of ""literary skill or sheer imaginative power"" and a pioneer of the Age of the Story Tellers along with H. Rider Haggard. He is now evaluated as a peer of authors such as Joseph Conrad (whom Stevenson influenced with his South Seas fiction) and Henry James, with new scholarly studies and organizations devoted to him. Throughout the century however, Stevenson remained widely popular. One index ranks him as the 26th most translated author in the world, ahead of Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe.Here's a couple poems from Garden.The LamplighterMy tea is nearly ready and the sun has left the sky;It's time to take the window to see Leerie going by;For every night at teatime and before you take your seat,With lantern and with ladder he comes posting up the street.Now Tom would be a driver and Maria go to sea,And my papa's a banker and as rich as he can be;But I, when I am stronger and can choose what I'm to do,O Leerie, I'll go round at night and light the lamps with you!For we are very lucky, with a lamp before the door,And Leerie stops to light it as he lights so many more;And O! before you hurry by with ladder and with light,O Leerie, see a little child and nod to him tonight!My ShadowI have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;For he sometimes shoots up taller like an India-rubber ball,And he sometimes gets so little that there's none of him at all.He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play,And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.He stays so close beside me, he's a coward you can see;I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!One morning, very early, before the sun was up,I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;But my lazy little shadow, like an errant sleepy-head,Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.The rating - well, a lot of my friends have given it the same, that's good enough for me.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: The Corpse ExhibitionNext review: The Supplicants AeschylusOlder review: The Glory of their TimesPrevious library review: Far From the Madding CrowdNext library review: One Fat Englishman",34,14
20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,Laysee,486,214,5,"December 1, 2020","A Child’s Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson is a lovely collection of poems that captured the unfettered imagination of children and the alloyed joy they find in ordinary things. It was a treat to read a hardcover copy that was beautifully illustrated by Brian Wildsmith.Below is a snap shot of the world as seen through the eyes of children:The ‘Summer Sun’ making the world glad, including a dust-clad spiderThe magic of gazing into a ‘looking glass river’The indignation of having to go to ‘bed in summer’ with 'the birds still hopping on the tree...’The delight of going up in a swing, ‘up in the air and over the wall...’The mystery that birds ‘go flying... high overhead’ while we ‘must go plodding and walking’The ‘joy to clamber... the happy hills of hay!’The whimsy of longing: ‘I should like to rise and go / Where the golden apples grow; -‘The dream of sailing through the skies ‘where the clover-tops are trees, and the rain-pools are the seas...’The pleasure of ‘picture books in winter’: ‘How am I to sing your praise, / Happy chimney-corner days, / Sitting safe in nursery books, / Reading picture-story books.’Every poem was gorgeously illustrated and I took time to pour over each piece of art as much as I relished each word. This is a book I bought as a gift with a special child in mind. Now, it has become a gift to myself.",34,32

20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,Soraya,21,4,5,"April 23, 2012","My grandma gave me this book when I was very young. I read it around ages 6-7 years-old. It made me happy to be young and now it makes me want to be that young again. It was strange how easily I could identify with the young Robert Louis Stevenson. I could absolutely understand his annoyance at being sent to bed while it was still light in summer and I just wanted to be there with him. When I read it back now I am reminded of the innocence of being so young, something that I didn't think about on first reading because I was far to innocent to understand innocence. I am baffled that a poetry book first released in 1885 could capture the imagination of a 7 year-old girl in 2002. That makes it unique in my view. In childish writing, inside the cover of my copy it says 'This book was given to me by Grandma Bertha.' My Grandma Bertha has since passed away and this is the most treasured thing I have that she gave to me. It was the first time I had loved reading poetry and it probably first sparked my interest in poetry as a genre. This book is brilliant. Buy it for your children or grand children. I'm very glad my Grandma Bertha did.",20,N/A
20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,Louie the Mustache Matos,880,59,4,"January 26, 2023","Anyone that has read my reviews will realize the esteem by which I hold Stevenson. A singular talent whether he was writing adventure or horror, lyrical or prose, for adults or for children. Here in A Child's Garden of Verses, Stevenson is writing poetry for children. There is incredible recollection of his childhood and all the magical things that filled him with wonder. In the 66 poems, he writes about the things he dreamed about and the wonderful things he would imagine. In a vivid poem that profoundly resonated with me, he writes about playing with his toys in bed and how soldiers would climb the mountains formed by his pillow and would explore the caves made by his blankets. There is mastery of those nuances of childhood, of having to miss school due to illness. True there are bits of affluenza type superiority, even where nationalistic tendencies may peek through, but those sensitivities are more of a modern concern. IMHO this is a really good sample of Stevenson's literary flexibility.",17,N/A

20413,A Childs Garden of Verses,max,186,21,3,"August 15, 2016","The Land of CounterpaneWhen I was sick and lay a-bed, I had two pillows at my head, And all my toys beside me lay, To keep me happy all the day.  * * * * *I was the giant great and still That sits upon the pillow-hill, And sees before him, dale and plain, The pleasant land of counterpane.Once upon a time, when I was a young child home sick from school and confined to bed, my mother encouraged me to memorize this poem. The title baffled me, since I had no idea what a counterpane was. I thought that perhaps it had some connection with a windowpane. Only years later when I looked the word up did I discover that it was a bedspread. I can still recall the captivatingly beautiful illustration that accompanied the poem -- a young boy in bed looking rather unwell with little houses and toy soldiers surrounding him. And so I tackled the project of memorizing it, reading the lines, getting the words into my head, using the rhyme scheme to lock it firmly into place. By day's end I could recite the full poem, all sixteen lines of its four stanzas.We had one of those delightful large anthologies of children's poems and stories (including several from A Child's Garden of Verses) and I recall things like ""Animal crackers and cocoa to drink"" (first line of a poem by Christopher Morley) and also the story of The Little Match Girl in the same volume. Do they even publish these anymore? More to the point, would children read them if they did? The book opened up another world, one which, in my solitude, I was all too happy to enter. This kind of book was for me a precious treasure. The notion of watching television was unthinkable, as my mother would not have allowed it. And really, for intellectual stimulation and aesthetic experience, what television program could possibly have matched my intimate encounter with R.L. Stevenson on that particular morning?We are now at the stage where the intrusion of technology into our lives -- especially the lives of children -- can properly be called into question. When you memorize a poem, you own it. It takes mental effort, of course, and the slow task of building the complete product in your head also requires considerable patience. Technology, such as cellphones with instantaneous internet access, removes any need for effort or for patience. Something precious is lost in the process. Alas, when the imaginative life shrivels and dies, civilization dies along with it.",15,2
