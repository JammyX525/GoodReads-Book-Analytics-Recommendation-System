11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Steve,784,218,5,"February 27, 2011","Since about 1980 I have probably read Ariel six times, and once again I step back from it thinking, My God! It remains for me the most powerful collection of poetry that I’ve ever read. However, I should probably scratch that word “remains,” since my previous readings had me in awe of numerous poems within the collection. But with this new edition, I am reading for the first time, Plath’s arrangement, which jacks things up considerably (How could that be possible?). I have no side in the Hughes / Plath wars. He cheated on her; she was high maintenance. As an outsider, it’s impossible to know much more beyond that surface story. On the poetry side of things, I have always thought that Hughes (a superb poet), with his violent and powerful imagery (see Crow) provided an assist in Plath’s own growth as a poet. And being the smart girl that she was, she would not be outdone in savage imagery, especially when Hughes provided her, though his adultery, with a red hot core of poetic purpose.And I don’t think this can be downplayed in any way. Frieda Hughes, the couple’s daughter, says so clearly in her (indispensible) Introduction, acknowledging (what we all know) that Ariel is an act of revenge. For Frieda, this is a difficult and sensitive subject. She loved her father, she loved her mother. She does try to recycle – though she doesn’t necessarily agree -- the old Hughes argument that the earlier arrangement was done for Art’s sake. Not so, not even close. There are a few poems that could have been dropped as weak (“Barren Woman” and “Magi” being agreed upon examples), but overall the restored poems are very strong. Moreover, it’s their placement that matters. If Plath’s collection was an act of literary revenge, Hughes' editing was an also an act of literary violence. He deliberately muddied the waters, blurring the impact of the collection as a whole. You see this in both the beginning and ending of the collection. The new edition follows an arc, an arc that, with all its ferocious savagery, strangely enough becomes transcendent with the last grouping of poems, which ends with “Wintering.” In the earlier edition of Ariel, Hughes has these poems (starting with “Daddy”) in sequence, but then tacked on a monkey’s tail grab bag of poems that robs the reader of the sense of closure that Plath’s arrangement provides. (It also helps to dilute the impact of the accusatory “Daddy.”) But it’s the beginning that really shocked me. The dropping of “The Rabbit Catcher,” a very strong poem, and one that must of burned Hughes' ears right off, is where the violence to Plath’s purpose is most obvious. It’s a key poem, since it establishes a foundation for the recurring accusatory poems (“A Secret,” “The Jailer,” “Daddy,” and I’m sure others), and these poems are part of an intended tapestry. I have no doubt that this restored version of Ariel will be the one that will now be studied, argued over, etc., from now on. Hughes' deceptive version will also be studied, but it will exist now as a footnote. It’s a testimony to the power of Plath’s poems that Ariel can exist in both forms, but there is no doubt which is the better version. ",91,15
11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Trevor,"1,279",21300,5,"December 28, 2011","I have always meant to read a book about the life of Sylvia Plath and to learn about the whole Ted Hughes adventure – but something there is that doesn’t love that kind of voyeurism and to date I have avoided it. There is a sense, however, where I think Plath’s poetry is so intensely personal that it would make sense to read it knowing more of the story of the American poet who killed herself on the bleak winter’s day in the year in which I was born.This ‘reinstatement’ of Plath’s Ariel has a foreword by Frieda Hughes, her daughter. It is a touching and interesting introduction to the poems and to the significance of a life as seen by her daughter.Frieda makes some interesting comments about the nature of art, poetry and artist – and other collective creations. The most interesting of all is how much we like to pretend we ‘know’ an artist by their poetry – but too often it works the other way around and the artist becomes a shadow we think of as being filled out by their poems. My favourite example of this is Beethoven who wrote both the forth and fifth symphonies at exactly the same time. If they were a reflection of his mood at the time then clearly he suffered from some kind of multiple personality disorder.This collection of poems contains some of Plath’s most disturbing and confronting poems. Daddy, for example, and Lady Lazarus are terribly difficult poems to read, even if they are perhaps the easiest poems to understand in this collection – they are raw and yet crafted at the same time. Plath more than any other poet is to be read aloud. These are poems that work as music and getting the music of the poems right is an important part of ‘getting’ the poems.The book also contains a series of ‘Facsimile drafts of the poem “Ariel”’ and there are eleven versions of the poem reprinted here. There is a terrible idea that people who do not know much about poetry believe that a great poet is somehow someone who can pop off a poem in one go and there it sits before them complete and perfect. This is rarely, if ever the case. A writer only becomes a writer when they learn that the creative process is a process. And most importantly, that that process is iterative. It is also important to think that if she spent quite so long writing the poem it might pay to spend a proportionate amount of time reading the poem. Before we go, I want to quote Plath’s, Tulips:The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-inI am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietlyAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nursesAnd my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuffLike an eye between two white lids that will not shut.Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,So it is impossible to tell how many there are.My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as waterTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage ----My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boatStubbornly hanging on to my name and address.They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolleyI watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my booksSink out of sight, and the water went over my head.I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.I didn't want any flowers, I only wantedTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.How free it is, you have no idea how free ----The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine themShutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.Even through the gift paper I could hear them breatheLightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down,Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour,A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.The tulips turn to me, and the window behind meWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadowBetween the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.Before they came the air was calm enough,Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a riverSnags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.They concentrate my attention, that was happyPlaying and resting without committing itself.The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closesIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,And comes from a country far away as health.One night when I was in the middle years of high school I was staying overnight at a friends house and we were doing home work and smoking cigarettes and we had a poem we needed to have read for English the next day. It was Plath’s Tulips and it was insanely difficult – infinitely more difficult than perhaps is reasonable to expect two 16-year-old boys (or there-abouts) to read and understand. Anyway, we were science nerds and poetry was far too other-worldly for us. All the same, I was madly in love with my English teacher and was keen to impress by coming to some understanding of the poem.I remember we started reading it and could make no sense of it at all. So, we stopped and went through it line by line, stopping at the end of each line and talking about what it could all mean. It was a slog, but suddenly we started getting a sense of the woman in the poem being in hospital and then of all that blood. I have read this poem hundreds of times since that night. About ten years ago I decided that it ought to be read in much the same voice that you might read these lines from TS Eliot:My nerves are bad to-night. Yes, bad. Stay with me.'Speak to me. Why do you never speak? Speak.'What are you thinking of? What thinking? What?'I never know what you are thinking. Think.'You know, neurotic. But I now think that is quite a wrong reading of the poem. I think the right reading (at least at the moment) is quite a straight and calm voice, but with a hint of perplexity in the tone, but only a hint, just enough to be detectable, and no more. Much the way Maggie Smith does Love Among the Lentils by Alan Bennett.If I was to give advice on coming to this poem for the first time – obviously you need to pay close attention to the relationship between the woman in the poem and the ‘others’ in the poem, all of the others, not least the tulips themselves. But also the nurses and the nuns and those who are implied as being there even if they never actually are. And then how often red and white are contrasted and how red on white is so often about blood in our culture and in this poem. And of course, water and all the things that water can signify.I love the way an act of love by someone (in sending tulips) can become like a series of hooks dug into the flesh of the person they are sent to. I love how peacefulness had previously meant avoiding being noticed and in becoming white and then the sudden redness of the tulips disturbs all that. How they stop being inanimate and become like wild animals needing to be put behind bars. I love how the tulips become the projection of this woman’s incredibly complex relationship with her husband and children. “They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations” and look at that word ‘associations’ – what a terribly important word that is. For that is what the tulips do not allow her – to remain clear of her associations.This is a complex poem and one that requires a careful study of the imagery and most important, a feeling for the music of the words on the page. It is, and has been for a very long time, one of my very favourite poems.Bird Brian has started a page here http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/2... of reviewers reading their reviews.

This edition has some facsimile in the back of Sylvia's drafts, and some original versions that were of course edited by her husband. Lady Lazarus is still one of my favorite poems, with this final stanza (if I can use that for a poem):""Out of the ashI rise with my red hairAnd I eat men like air.""",33,1 comment
11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Roya,190,376,4,"November 10, 2015","Final rating: 3.5 starsLast May I went on a cruise to Alaska with my parents, brother, and grandfather. The book I was reading at the time was crap. Fortunately for me, there was this freaking cool library on the ship.I'm going to go off on bit of a tangent here, but I think it's kinda lame how a cruise ship has a library and the island I live on hasn't had one since I was eight....Anyway, moving away from my general bitterness, let's go back the library. So I picked up this cool book called The Bell Jar. I enjoyed it so much that it became a favourite. Reading ""Mad Girl's Love Song"" made me more interested in Plath's poetry, so reading this was sort of bound to happen.This book was probably longer than it actually needed to be. All the poems in the first part are repeated in the second part, which is a facsimile of Plath's manuscript with all of her edits and scribblings. The first part is just like the second part, except it's corrected. A lot of the poems in this book honestly made no sense to me until I analysed them. Most caught my attention, but few held it. ""The Jailor"" and ""A Birthday Present"" were so interesting and made me want to know how they'd end. ""Lady Lazarus"" took me back to the first time I read ""Mad Girl's Love Song"", while ""Daddy"" is very resentful and gripping. I also adored ""Lesbos"", ""Elm"", and (in some ways) ""Wintering"". I don't think I'm really geared towards poetry, but Plath does an exceptional job even when you don't know what the hell she's going on about and have to add ""analysis"" to the end of every Google search. What can be said about this book is that it really sets a certain tone throughout. It's a bit dark and depressing, but simultaneously rich and full of emotion. You have to be in the right mood to read it, but it's never anything less than beautiful. I tend to only keep five-star books on my bookshelf, but despite its imperfections, this book had quite a few gems, so it's a keeper.",31,11
11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Kimber,197,61,5,"August 2, 2022","I loved this version better than the one originally published by her husband, Ted Hughes. Her symbols and recurring themes stand out-- death, mausoleums, purity, whiteness, red, flowers, the moon, blackness. Rebirth. It's stunning how I feel more at one with her vision- I can appreciate experiencing her from this perspective, the way she herself chose and arranged them.. it shows her in full control of her artistry. Although Frieda explains her father's editorial decisions it is understandable that she defend him but not satisfactory. The energy- overall- feels different. Some of them hit hard. But as Sylvia always circled back to the symbolism of winter to spring- it is felt and experienced as she meant here.",27,6
11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Florencia,649,1876,4,"January 26, 2018","First reviewEvery time I don't love some book that other people love, I feel bad. Or stupid because I didn't understand it. Or a heartless gal because apparently I don't have a soul and that must be the reason why I'm not jumping up and down after reading it. I've always been interested in Plath's life, such an intense and tragic life. I read a bit about it and it seems like it's all there in her poetry. Her intimate, unsettling, honest poetry.So, I really liked a couple of poems and the rest was okay. I'm not a fan yet, but it was a good read. Actual rating: 3.5 stars.Next step, ""The Bell Jar"" (I think I should have read that one first).Feb 05, 14* Also on my blog.",24,12
11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Eliza,593,1381,3,"June 23, 2017","I thought her book, The Bell Jar, was much better than any of these poems. I almost wish she had been more of a novelist than a poet. Oh well. Either way, maybe two of these poems stuck out to me in a good way but then the rest were very strange and random. Honestly, I didn't connect to her poems the way I did with her novel, so that was a bummer.Overall, they're definitely poems to check out if you have time. But don't be expecting Emily Dickinson or anything like that, because you'll be disappointed.",22,N/A
11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,But_i_thought_,169,1426,5,"January 2, 2023","Reading poetry has always felt like futile detective work for me, so I was pleasantly surprised by the impact this collection had on me! “Ariel”, Sylvia Plath’s most famous poetry collection, was written in a “blood jet” of creativity shortly before she committed suicide in 1963. The collection charts her emotional turmoil in the wake of her disintegrating marriage, the claustrophobic effects of domesticity, the salve of motherhood, and her conflicting attractions to both rebirth and self-destruction. After her death, her husband Ted Hughes became the curator of the (unpublished) Ariel poems and unfortunately “sanitized” the collection by removing what he deemed “confrontational” poems and replacing them with other “less offensive” poems. These missing poems, released in later collections, included those that portrayed him in a negative light (e.g. “The Jailer”, “The Rabbit Catcher”), commented on his infidelity (e.g. “A Secret”, “The Other”, “The Detective”), or insulted acquaintances of the couple (e.g. “Lesbos”). This restored edition (published recently in 2004) for the first time reinstates Plath’s original arrangement. I personally found the “missing” poems to be some of the most raw and evocative of the lot. For example, in “The Rabbit Catcher”, Plath describes a windy walk in the wild in which she comes across rabbit snares and imagines the game keeper waiting with almost sexual anticipation for the death of his prey. The symbol of the rabbit snares evolves into a metaphor for her marriage towards the end of the poem:And we too had a relationship - Tight wires between us,Pegs too deep to uproot, and a mind like a ring Sliding shut on some quick thing, The constriction killing me also.In another poem, ""The Courage of Shutting-Up"", Plath describes the trauma of public silence on her husband's affair. Her tongue is compared to a relic that has been dried and hung up, like taxidermy, and she likens this state of forced silence to that of:A country no longer heard of, An obstinate independency Insolvent among the mountains.Many of the poems in this collection crackle with vivid, inventive imagery, explosive symbolism and memorable opening lines (e.g. My night sweats grease his breakfast plate as the opening to “The Jailor”). While reading, I could easily spend an entire evening dissecting a single poem, mining the various layers of meaning and supplementing with online research. Overall, this was a moving, unsettling and illuminating reading experience, well worth the effort, and highly recommended, even for poetry virgins like me.

11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Auguste,61,169,5,"February 6, 2017","Maybe when I first read Ariel, the originally published, Ted Hughes edition of the poems, I was too young to appreciate Plath's stunning vision; however, I'm inclined to think that her own layout of her swansong collection was the decisive factor in my recent reading of the work, which blew me away. So much substance - the words 'dark matter' come to mind - from a poet so young, it's rare, it's humbling. Being Greek, I can only think of Karyotakis's last collection, though Plath is a clearly seperate case, since self-destruction was to her more of a precise art, a science, almost.I urge readers, be they familiar with Plath or not, to give the Restored Edition a try. This book has brought considerable beauty into my life; it's one of those reads whose lingering feeling is that of a profound gratitude.",16,N/A

11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Holly,363,68,3,"July 14, 2017","I gave it my all, but Plath's masterpiece just isn't for me. And, like Plath's poetry, it's a personal problem. The poems in Ariel are too obscure, too heady, too veiled—no one could ever accuse Plath of being too conscious of her audience. A woman always thinks she'll see her own pain in the words of another. The idea of Sylvia Plath is a perversely nice one to mull over, to play ""I-saw-it-coming,"" to diminish her entire life to those few hours in her kitchen. Frieda Hughes' insightful forward addresses this phenomenon.But don't get me wrong: Plath can write a devastating line, play masterfully with compounds, throw out appalling phrases with the bathwater. She's at her best when she's frantic and flying (""Getting There,"" ""Daddy""). But she lacks a certain artistry, the kind of assured rhythm I love in poets like Gwendolyn Brooks and Louise Glück. I don't mean to make meaningless comparisons; it's just that my background in poetry is elementary. But Sylvia is a complete cypher, the brainy, silent girl in the back of the room, and as much as she intrigues me, I can't know her. She speaks purposefully esoterically, and all it does is cast a wash of contextless melodrama over her ultimately style-free poetry (the embodiment of what I mean is the poem ""The Other""—yes, I know what it's about). And while the exterior expression of her interior consciousness is beautiful for Plath, it just doesn't do a lot for me. Because that's what I demand in poetry: me, me, me.",10,N/A

Plath's use of color fascinates me, and reading these sparkling, corrosive poems aloud makes your tongue and ear dance. But being completely honest, I found a lot of them impenetrable without research. I just had absolutely no idea what was going on, and so couldn't remember most of them after I'd turned the page (with some notable exceptions like ""Lady Lazarus"").

11625,Ariel The Restored Edition,Wesley,5,2,1,"February 11, 2015","I've been having trouble organizing my thoughts and reactions to Plath, so here's a list in no particular order of some things that I wondered while reading Ariel. To all you Plathers: please understand that I respect Plath as a poet, that my rating reflects my limited perception of her work, and that I'm well aware of the subjectivity of taste. However...1. What exactly is so great about Sylvia Plath? I don't mean that sarcastically, I mean what are Sylvia Plath's literary innovations, her credentials for being referred to as great? Formal invention? Subject matter? What is it? Ezra Pound is great because he initiated a literary paradigm shift from stodgy Victorian poetry to something fresh and exciting and new. Chaucer is great because of his uncanny command of Middle English and his diverse influence on other great writers (Pound himself being one of them). How did Plath make poetry new? More importantly: did she? I don't see much in terms of traditional forms in the book (sonnets, sestinas, and the like), and much of the book is —or appears to be— free verse. However, I think there are other poets who can write much better free verse than Plath (Pound, H.D., Eliot, Ashbery, Jarrell, and the like). So, in terms of craft, how is Plath great? Why should we read her?2. Many people, but especially Americans like myself, have an obsession with the role of the Artist Martyr, a young soul full of tortured creativity who dies a tragic death, leaving us wondering what works they might have produced had they lived longer (looking at you, Jimi). To me, Plath's psychological problems and her untimely, disturbing death has shrouded her work in a sort of perceived mystery and haunting power. Or rather I should say that Plath fans have intentionally shrouded her work with such a facade. Quite frankly, I don't get it. What if Plath had lived a long, healthy life? Would this influence the way we read her work? Should it?3. I keep hearing that one shouldn't write about love or death. This is ridiculous. I think one can write about either, so long as the writing is excellent, original, innovative in some capacity. Plath writes frequently about death, but does so in a way that I found unforgettably boring, which is quite ironic considering the realities of her life. Her work on death sometimes borders a juvenile obsession, like a teenager first coming to grips with her own mortality, but having little of substance to say about the whole experience.4. Plath's work seemed to me more cerebral than aortic, more about the mind and its strangeness than anything else of human experience. That's fine. And perhaps this explains some of her style. Is she deliberately trying to disorient the reader, to use her art to imitate psychological instability? I like this idea. I like it because it provides some validation of her form, her voice, her unusual juxtaposition of images. But why then, when finishing each and every poem, did I feel nothing, think nothing, save for a vague suspicion that I had just wasted a bunch of time? Perhaps I'm just uncultured and uninitiated?5. When I read something that resonates with me, it resonates with me because I learned something, and not just about the story or the characters or the craft of writing. All that's great. But it resonated with me because I learned something about myself. When I finished this book, I spent a few days mulling it over. I realized I had learned nothing, taken nothing away from Plath's work that informed my perception of myself or others, didn't provoke new ideas or explore emotional depths. The whole experience felt flat and lifeless, disconnected, incoherent and, I admit, rather irritating.  ",9,N/A
