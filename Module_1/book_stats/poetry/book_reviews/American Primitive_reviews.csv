178959,American Primitive,Dolors,515,2139,5,"March 28, 2016","I close my eyes and it's not difficult to imagine Mary Oliver waking up right before dawn to open the window shutters of her house in Provincetown and wait for the sun to trace its slothful arch while waiting for words to come. Words. Words that indeed do come; in deluges, in hasty frenzy, flooding the black tip of her charcoal pencil to fill her notebook and the hearts of countess wistful readers. Words that draw a picture of the natural world by a keen, careful observer of the small wonders that occur every day for those who have the patience to see beyond the prosaic facts of the quotidian. Oliver's clearly delineated stanzas represent a paean to life, nature and to conscious acceptance of the unfathomable mysteries and contradictions of existence. Her naturalistic sensibilities are reminiscent of Emerson or Whitman, but there is an inimitable gentleness in the texture of Oliver’s verses that distinguishes her from other ""praise poets"". In her probing questions, one may find answers, but also a reaffirmed conviction that allows wonder and gratefulness to coexist rather than to be at odds. There is genuine devotion for ""mother earth"", for one can tell that Oliver's ""work is loving the world"" in the hymns that she sings to the heron gliding over the still pond, the fox in the leafy shrubbery or the sunflower seeking for guidance in the cerulean sky, but not the sort of puritan adoration more typical of religious worshiping. Oliver's poems brim over with passionate, carnal sensuality that is not edulcorated or tamed down by conventional standards. “How shall I touch youunless it iseverywhere?” The GardensThe spirituality of Oliver's poetry is without temple or creed. It doesn't leave anybody out. Both the believers and godless, the apathetic and fervent, the skeptical and unsuspicious are equally summoned by the sheer hopefulness of her meditative verses, whose melody invokes that of a latitudinarian prayer that beseeches us to make peace with grief and to embrace our identity with all its razor-sharp edges. “What should we sayis the truth of the world?The miles alonein the pinched dark?or the push of the promise?or the wound of delight?”The bobcatA fertile question to greet the world with every morning, like Mary does. Her lyrical chants teach us something that is very simple but extraordinary at once: that poetry is a spiritual activity that generates an immense pleasure because it stops one dead on his tracks; only to start walking again with renewed vision. To look at the world under the spell of poetry is to carry out an exercise of utmost respect towards all things, in all their forms, even the ones that ceased to be, because they become perennial through the power of condensed art in minimalistic expression.And so after the frosty night, after the utter darkness, the sound of promise may rise again with the sun, and the loud roar of the river and the chirping of birds will tone down the unnerving humming of doubts and uncertainty, soothed by restorative stanzas that take the edge off the inconsistencies of life.May that be so for those who raise their faces towards the morning sunbeams and its silent glories.

178959,American Primitive,s.penkevich,731,4996,5,"March 19, 2012","‘Whatever it is you try to do with your life, nothing will ever dazzle you like the dreams of your body’I’ve always found that the world outside my window, deep in the immersion of nature, is where I feel most alive and at peace. I love to travel into the wild woods of Michigan, off from the beaten path, and lose myself among the trees. I look up and feel dwarfed and insignificant among the leafy giants that stretch towards the limitless sky, and allow the breeze to blow through me, taking my worldly thoughts away with its passing. Sometimes it feels as if I could just dissolve from my physical form, meld with nature, and become counted among the countless trees and plants. Perhaps this is the primitive animal instinct in us all, calling us back to simplicity. The pristine beauty of Mary Oliver’s Pulitzer Prize winning collection, American Primitive, is the voice of this wild world and celebrates the unity of the animals and Earth. Her words are a trek through the seasons, a nature walk of words across meadows and streams and deep into the mysterious forests of our hearts.Oliver has a gift to bestow all the sounds, smells and feelings of the wilderness through mere words. You will feel the drops of rain, hear the babbling brook, and watch the animals scurry about all within a white page. She harnesses the rhythm of nature, from winding rivers to the sight of two snakes slithering through a field of flowers ‘like a matched team / like a dance / like a love affair’. Poems such as Bobcat use the form of the poem to reflect the darting movement of the beast across the land, or to elevate the imagery of waves in The Sea. The language is always simple, yet intensely eloquent.All four seasons are accounted for within this volume. Her poems of the Ohio winters hit close to home, detailing the muted silence of a snow covered night, beneath a starless sky such as in First Snow:Its whiterhetoric everywhere calling us back to why, howwhence such beauty and whatthe meaningThere are the blossoming poems of spring, bringing us rain ‘soft as lilacs and clean as holy water’, and the glorious warmth of summer. 
  There is no end,believe me! To the inventions of summer,to the happiness you bodyis willing to bear
While much of the works are directed towards the blooming and buzzing of life, the river of her poems travel to darker territories at times where the land reclaims the living. The poem The Kitten, about a stillborn cat, is particularly moving:
  But instead I took it out into the fieldand opened the earthand put it backsaying, it was realsaying, life is infinitely inventivesaying, what other amazementslie in the dark seed of the earth, yesI think I did right to go out aloneAnd give it back peacefully, and cover the placeWith the reckless blossoms of weeds
There it the fall poetry of the falling leaves and dying warmth, and the wet smell of damp decay rises up from sweet stanzas to fill your nose. I once worked at a large park and was lucky to spend my summers surrounded by miles and miles of wilderness. This collection really brings back the joy from those times, yet one poem in particular hits close to home. Something mentions a man who goes into nature to end his life, which is something that commonly happened at this park as well and her words brings back the unshakable memory of an early morning discovering a swinging form engulfed by the rising sun. From the earth we came, and to the earth we will return.If you love nature, or poetry, or just good writing in general, do yourself a favor and introduce yourself to the poems of Mary Oliver. She gives Robert Frost a good rival with American Primitive, and upon reading it you will most likely find yourself lacing up your shoes and setting forth into the woods with a new found synergy with the rhythm of the wild. I highly suggest you do so. And now, nature calls and I must go. 5/5Fall SongAnother year gone, leaving everywhereits rich spiced residues: vines, leaves,the uneaten fruits crumbling damplyin the shadows, unmattering backfrom the particular islandof this summer, this now, that now is nowhereexcept underfoot, molderingin that black subterranean castleof unobservable mysteries - roots and sealed seedsand the wanderings of water. ThisI try to remember when time's measurepainfully chafes, for instance when autumnflares out at the last, boisterous and like us longingto stay - how everything lives, shiftingfrom one bright vision to another, foreverin these momentary pastures.",37,31
178959,American Primitive,Kimber,197,61,4,"March 2, 2022","Nature is the theme uniting this well-crafted, beautiful and majestic collection of poems from one of my favorite poets. Mary transcends the physical world by in essence being One with that world. Sometimes her ability to do that is disconcerting. While this was not my favorite collection of hers (poetry is felt on such a personal level) these are remarkable poems indeed. Notably Moles, John Chapman, Tasting the Wild Grapes, The Honey Tree, A Meeting, Postcards from Flamingo, Vultures, An Old Whorehouse, Rain in Ohio, Skunk Cabbage, The Fish, Humpbacks, The Roses, Blackberries, In Blackwater Woods, The Plum Trees....I could probably go on.....But I especially loved First Snow. I'm always trying to capture (somehow) the feeling into words-of what feels like the experience of the feeling of snow, and more specifically the first snow of the season. And Ms. Oliver does it. Ah, thank you! It's something magical-the first snow!-and part of what makes me glad that I live in the North. ""The snowbegan herethis morning and all daycontinued, its whiterhetoric everywherecalling us back to why, how,whence such beauty and whatthe meaning; suchan oracular fever! flowingpast windows, an energy it seemedwould never ebb, never settleless than lovely! and only now,deep into night,it has finally ended.The silenceis immense,and the heavens still holda million candles, nowherethe familiar things:stars, the moon,the darkness we expectand nightly turn from. Treesglitter like castlesof ribbons, the broad fieldssmolder with light, a passingcreekbed liesheaped with shining hills;and though the questionsthat have assailed us all dayremain — not a singleanswer has been found –walking out nowinto the silence and the lightunder the trees,and through the fields,feels like one.""",18,6
178959,American Primitive,Chris,710,17,2,"July 14, 2013","So after years of teaching ""Crossing the Swamp"" and really coming to love it, I last year made an annotation for myself on my very own copy of the poem that I found this May: ""Why the fuck aren't you reading more Mary Oliver?"" Since I always take my own vituperative and vulgar advice, I picked up this collection. And now I know why I don't read more Mary Oliver.Take this example as indicative. Here's my favorite of her poems in this collection: The FishThe first fish I ever caught would not lie down quiet in the pail but flailed and sucked at the burning amazement of the air and died in the slow pouring off of rainbows. Nice, right? That ""lie down/ quiet"" rejected by the flailing and sucking of life refusing to let go as life so often does, the ""amazement"" of the air, and this transmutation as the fish dissolves/evolves into liquid rainbows. That's nature poetry I can get behind. And while I admit there's a good bit of the ""wrenching things awry"" Richard Wilbur rails against in ""Praise in Summer"" (one of my favorite poems that I refuse to allow to hijack this review for too long), this--comparatively--doesn't seem like a gross manipulation of the natural image. The liquid rainbows are a bit magical, a bit idealized, but we all know or should know that there's something liquid about the glimmer of fish scales. It's not a huge leap but a natural truth I know well very nicely phrased. It's a damn fine little poem. Of course, Mary can't leave it alone. The poem doesn't end there. It continues (with no stanza breaks):  Later I opened his body and separated the flesh from the bones and ate him. Now the sea is in me: I am the fish, the fish glitters in me; we are risen, tangled together, certain to fall back to the sea. Out of pain, and pain, and more pain we feed this feverish plot, we are nourished by the mystery. Really!? Really with the overt Oneness? Really with the inextricability and the euphemized death? ""[N]ourished by the mystery""? Can't you just leave well the hell alone, Maria? Must we leap into natural fantasy? This pedantic, new-agey aggression will not stand, man, and it's all over this collection. Bluefish become ""angels"". Climbing up the Chagrin River she finds the ""timeless castles/ of emerald eddies"". Two perfectly described snakes ""like two black whips/ lifting and dashing forward;/ in perfect concert"" by poem's end travel ""like a dance/ like a love affair."" This last is the most infuriating because she has again busted a perfectly lovely poem with what need not be said. Present the image and let it work upon the reader. Leave us something to do. Mary Oliver has mad chops. She has a fabulous ear (click that ""Crossing the Swamp"" link if you haven't and read it aloud), solid metrics, and she often finds images that grip and connect. I know I'm not being entirely fair when I ask her to serve effectively as a conveyor rather than an interpreter of the natural world, but I ask it nonetheless. In short, this collection is just good enough to make me angry that it's not better. ",16,3
178959,American Primitive,David J,217,204,4,"April 19, 2019","4.5I love Mary Oliver’s poetry. This is the fourteenth collection of hers I’ve read and it’s everything I’ve come to expect when reading her words (though her earlier poetry is distinctly different from the majority of her work). Oliver won the Pulitzer with this collection and it’s easy to see why: she writes simply but deftly, and each poem is impactful.Most poems focus on the nature around Oliver, around us. The beauty, the fierceness, the life, the death, the wildness, the love, the horror, the stillness, the trepidation that sits in front of us right outside our front doors. It’s all right there and Oliver urges us to experience it. There’s something to be learned within every step of the woods, with every babble of the stream, within every small death that feels so grand and almost too much.There’s an obvious connection to Transcendentalism here, and while I can’t say I’m the biggest fan of Thoreau and Emerson (Whitman’s great, though), I think Oliver taps into their groundwork and presents a modern take on self-reliance and one’s place with nature. It’s also a take I greatly prefer. With her passing earlier this year, I’ve finally gotten around to reading this monumental work, and I think everyone should read it at some point. And since it’s the tail end of poetry month, I hope to read her last collection “Devotions” (2017) as well.",15,1 comment
178959,American Primitive,Jessaka,853,100,5,"February 7, 2016","Mary Oliver's poems should be read in the morning when the birds have first awakened, or by a woodstove on a cold winter's day with the wind blowing through the wind chimes outside your door, or even before sitting in meditation. These poems may quiet your mind or just make you feel blessed to have even read them.Her poems take you into the beauty of a wild swamp where alligators recite their poetry and to the sadness of a kitten that was born dead, as she gives it softly back to the earth. You walk with her in the spring and in the summer woods to listen to the robins and the crows, and then you walk with her through a whorehouse where spiders have spun their webs in the chandelier. The vultures are dark butterflies that live on the dead, and the white egrets fly like showers of fire. Her poetry brings you the spirituality in all things and even transcends it as she takes you to meet God, even if you are not aware that one exists. One poems haunts me, ""The Lost Children."" This is only the first half: ""In southern Ohio,a long time ago,Lydia Osborn, aged eleven, lefther younger sisteron the path and headed aftersome straying cows, and did not return.Seven days a search was made; menfrom Ohio and Kentucky trampedthe darkness, milesof underbrush and trees.They found where she'd slept,under two fallen trees, and eatenfox grapes and other berries.The searchers went on into the darkness. On the fifteenth day they foundfootprints by a stream;nearby, a blackberry path, and near thata small house built of sticks,with a little door, and a roof of green moss.Inside, a tiny bed of leaves and more moss,wild flowersscattered over it...""And she won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry.

178959,American Primitive,Maria,609,99,5,"June 20, 2016","I don’t know if you have ever seen it, or at least heard of it, but there’s a rather famous sculpture of a naked woman bleeding light through the cracks on her body. The piece is called Expansion and is from the talented Paige Bradley. As I read American Primitive by Mary Oliver, my brain apparently couldn’t help but connect the two.“and though the questionsthat have assailed us all dayremain – not a singleanswer has been found – walking out nowinto the silence and the lightunder the trees,and through the fields,feels like one.”Mary Oliver acknowledges the cracks. Instead of seeing them as something that makes us flawed though, she seems to celebrate them for allowing the light to shine through. For her, every moment is a matter of perspective. It all comes down to us, to the way we choose to interpret what our eyes fall upon. She seems to find splendor at every corner.“But we were fourteenand no way dust could hidethe expected glamour from us,or teach us anything.”We might all be walking around with our eyes open, but Mary Oliver sees. I couldn’t be more grateful for her poetry. It feels as if she is lending us her senses, as if she is tempting us with her senses – go out and see for yourself, it’s beautiful, even when it hurts.“there is no end,believe me! to the inventions of summer,to the happiness your bodyis willing to bear.”One detail that appears to be more evident in American Primitive is Mary Oliver’s gift for creating certain textures with her words that are beyond palpable. It’s quite an experience.If I were to describe American Primitive in one word, I believe I would go with feathers. They are soft to the touch and yet together they cover wings that lift bodies into the sky.",9,N/A
178959,American Primitive,Dan,"1,057",52,5,"January 6, 2020","5 stars.Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1984.This collection of 50 pastoral poems is about as good as I’ve read — particularly if you have a childlike wonder for the natural world.Oliver’s poetry is conventional and clear. She makes heavy use of familiar images to evoke nostalgia. She was one of the most popular poets of the past half century and hailed from the suburbs of Cleveland Ohio. Here is one of my favorite poems from the American Primitive collection about Johnny Appleseed. John ChapmanHe wore a tin pot for a hat, in whichhe cooked his suppertoward eveningin the Ohio forests. He worea sackcloth shirt and walkedbarefoot on feet crooked as roots. And everywhere he wentthe apple trees sprang up behind him lovelyas young girls.No Indian or settler or wild beastever harmed him, and he for his part honoredeverything, all God's creatures! thought little,on a rainy night,of sharing the shelter of a hollow log touchingflesh with any creatures there: snakes,racoon possibly, or some great slab of bear.Mrs. Price, late of Richland County,at whose parents' house he sometimes lingered,recalled: he spokeonly once of women and his gray eyesbrittled into ice.

178959,American Primitive,Rebecca,"3,508",2506,4,"February 12, 2019","(3.5) Although it won the Pulitzer Prize, this collection isn’t quite as strong (at least for me) as Dream Work. However, it still has plenty of memorable lines, deceptively simple but densely packed with wisdom and, as always, Oliver encourages the reader to appreciate nature and the seasons afresh. There are also a handful of poems about relationships: human tragedies, love and its loss.Some favorite lines:“you do / what you can if you can; whatever // the secret, and the pain, // there’s a decision: to die / or to live, to go on / caring about something.” (from “John Chapman”)“though the questions / that have assailed us all day / remain—not a single / answer has been found— / walking out now / into the silence and the light / under the trees, / and through the fields, / feels like one.” (from “First Snow”)“To live in this world // you must be able / to do three things: / to love what is mortal; / to hold it // against your bones knowing / your own life depends on it; / and, when the time comes to let it go, / to let it go.” (from “In Blackwater Woods”)",8,N/A

I thought it was strong, solid nature poetry, but without that extra dimension that makes me love poets like Robert Frost and Annie Dillard - writers who can get you so wrapped up in a completely mundane scene that you don't even see it coming when they hit you with some profound, metaphysical truth.

178959,American Primitive,Joshua Buhs,647,103,4,"April 1, 2016","From the banal to the scrupulous.As I've said before, my vocabulary for writing about poetry is limited. So take that for what it's worth.I'm not quite sure what to make of this book. It won the Pulitzer, which is no guarantee of quality, but says better people than me thought it excellent. And, indeed, there are excellent--amazing--poems here. But they are mixed with some that seem simple-minded (perhaps I am too simple minded to understand them) and others that distract from and vitiate the collection's point.As the title suggests, Oliver is after a primeval American experience, one that not only connects the body to the natural world, but shows them as made up of the same stuff. She aims at stripping away modernity, even as she uses its poetical techniques, to get at those basic things: eating, sex, breathing, seeing, being. The poems are arranged according to the progress of the seasons, underlining that even our sense of time is rooted in the ways of a nature to which we belong but which we cannot control or even escape.At times, her attempts seem heavy handed. She relies often the words sensuous and silk, both of which proclaim--rather than demonstrate--what she is trying to expose. Some of the poems, in their openness, seem naive. I guess they are meant to be meditations on experience, but the experiences seem well known. Indeed, some of it reads like nineteenth-century Romantic poetry, in its paeans to the healing powers of nature, in its saccharine mood, although the language is more modest, the modernist's demotic English in search of transcendence.Other poems, though, are densely woven, tying together acute observations, metaphors, and language. There's ""The Fish,"" for example, with its tangle of pagan, Christian, and naturalistic imagery: ""I opened his body and separated/the flesh from the bones/and ate him. Now the sea/is in me: I am the fish, the fish/glitters in me; we are/risen, tangled together, certain to fall/back to the sea. Out of pain,/and pain, and more pain/we feed this feverish plot, we are nourished/by the mystery."" The ending of ""Moles"" knocked my socks off:""so willing to continue/generation after generation/accomplishing nothing/but their brief physical lives/as they live and die,/pushing and shoving/with their stubborn muzzles against/the whole earth,finding it/delicious.""The same elegiac mood brings a whole new dimension to the fable of Johnny Appleseed, in a poem titled ""John Chapman"": ""Well, the trees he planted or gave away/ prospered, and he became/the good legend, you do/what you can if you can; whatever//the secret, and the pain//there's a decision: to die,/or to live, to go on/caring about something. In Spring, in Ohio,.in the forests that are left you can still find/sign of him: patches/of cold white fire.""There's a bit of humor here, too--which is much needed in nature writing. There's the ""Did you?"" ending of ""Music,"" for example. Mostly, though, joy and happiness--and there are a lot of references to those--are mediated through metaphor or oblique description (getting messy eating berries and honey is joy for Oliver). The sexiest poem here--""Blossom""--is about a pond that opens in April to the moon, the desire of frogs: ""we belong/to the moon and when the ponds/open, when the burning/begins the most/thoughtful among us dreams/of hurrying down/into the black petals,/into the fire/into the night where times lies shattered,/into the body of another.""That tidiness about sex--making it the moon's reflection on a pond--reflects a very 19th century view. (I can imagine the same imagery in a Emily Dickinson poem.) Which brings up the most problematic part of these poems: the use of Native Americans as a proxy for the correct way to interact with nature. There's some straight-up red face here, with one poem talking about a person painted red. Native Americans, of course, are the stereotype of the American Primitive.The problem here is more than just one about being politically correct. (Although reading this without noticing the use of Native Americans is like reading Thoreau's ""Walking"" and glossing over ""Manifest Destiny"" encysted there.) It's that the Native Americans remain stereotypes. Just as nature so often remains stereotyped--fat berries in spring, herons, what have you. It's the problem of the collection as far as I am concerned, what keeps it from being great. The poems too rigorously turns nature into objects of thought, things, and too rarely shows the interpenetration. A large part of that is because the book seems to rely on Romantic tropes, which values wilderness, and that which is separate from humans, and not other kinds of nature--the kind that is always around us.But of course that should be expected, from the title alone. Oliver is after a particular experience of a particular kind of nature. And in going after that she more often hits her mark than misses it. ",5,N/A
