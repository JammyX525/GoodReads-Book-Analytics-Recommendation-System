31374,A Great Deliverance,Phrynne,"3,111",1975,5,"August 19, 2017","This is a series I have been meaning to start for ages and I am so glad I have got around to it at last! This book is great! It has everything I like in a mystery.1. A really attractive, talented, charismatic main character who knows exactly what he is doing. And so far he does not appear to be an alcoholic or have any other unappealing trait as most MCs in crime books do these days. (although as this book was written in 1988 nearly everyone smokes all the time)2. Due also to the date it was written there is a lovely historical aspect to everything. It's all done without mobiles and computers, and life in general seems calmer.3. The story is good, gritty and totally gripping. The last scenes in the psychiatric hospital made me reach for the tissues.4. The author knows how to write. Just occasionally she gets a bit carried away with setting her scenes but she does it so nicely I can forgive her.5. Best of all there are a LOT more books in the series. I love a good series:) If you have not read this yet I strongly recommend it!",112,19
31374,A Great Deliverance,Christine ,568,1068,4,"March 31, 2020","This is a novel that had been sitting on my tbr list for some time. Though the idea of picking it up really peaked my interest, I think the fact that a number of books in the series are quite long put me off. Since I’m retired, I finally figured if I was ever going to read long books, now’s the time. This is a terrific British tale, surprisingly written by an American author. Elizabeth George is a wonderful writer. Her prose is reminiscent of old-time British writing, though not as stilted. Every page or so contains a word I was unfamiliar with, and I loved using the kindle dictionary to learn the definitions. I really didn’t find this to be a flow-breaker as the book moves along at a relatively leisurely pace as it is; furthermore, many of these words have meanings that are clear in the context they are used, so one really doesn’t need a dictionary to understand the content. Characterization is outstanding. Our protagonist, Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley, is also the eighth earl of Asherton. He is newly paired with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers who has difficulty getting along with others and low self esteem. As they pair up in an effort to discover the truth about a number of unfortunate occurrences in rural England, we learn their fascinating back stories and see them attempt to form some sort of working relationship. This tale has a large cast. I did have a bit of trouble remembering who was who, so was happy I was reading on the kindle with its helpful “search” button.The author has a real handle on delivering imagery to the reader. I feel like I grasped a true sense of the British countryside in this novel.The plot is captivating. There are quite a few threads and threadlets to keep track of, but all came together beautifully at the end. I would, however, have liked the pace of the final revelations to have been slower so that I could better savor the unraveling of the puzzles. Ms. George makes liberal use of Shakespearian references. This will be a delight for Shakespeare lovers. Alas, I have never been much of a fan of his so feel I missed out a bit here.I found A Great Deliverance engaging enough to continue on with the series. In fact, if not for a ridiculously late spring blizzard, I would have immediately trekked down to the library for a copy of book 2. Oh well, that will be a book I can look forward to on another day. I highly recommend A Great Deliverance to all lovers of British crime stories with great characterization and sense of place. ",82,39
31374,A Great Deliverance,Melindam,607,255,1,"August 6, 2022","For me, the author's Inspector Lynley series checks all the boxes why I give ""modern"" detective fiction a wide berth.1) useless, mind-numbingly boring navel-gazing of the detectives for 290 pages out of 400 - CHECK2) (as a consequence of 1) story moving at a drunken snail's pace - CHECK3) (as a consequence of 1 & 2) there's hardly any info about the ongoing investigation - CHECK4) (as a consequence of 1 & 3) almost non-existent police procedurals - CHECKPersonally, I also could not find any traces of the celebrated ""dynamics"" between detective Lynley (the detective aristocrat - yeah, sure) & B. Havers (the working-class sidekick) even later in the series, for back then I was a masochist & read a few other books of the series. Both were bland and cliched and I did not care for them a bit, so the fact that I had to be in their heads all the bloody time, doing the oh-so-exciting naval-gazing with them made it an almost excruciating reading process.",58,9
31374,A Great Deliverance,Idarah,464,45,5,"February 5, 2011","I initially saw the television adaptation of this book on PBS Mystery!. I was moved by the dark, Yorkshire setting and the budding friendship of Lynley and Havers. It had such a gritty conclusion, that I went to the library the next day and checked out the next book in the series. That was almost 9 years ago! After finishing book six in the series last year, I felt it was time to read the book that started it all. I can't believe I waited so long! Thus far, this my favorite book in the series! From the beginning, there's an onslaught of disappointments and ghosts among the protagonists. Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, who has recently been demoded to a uniform policewoman, is put back into the detective role when a ""delicate"" case is brought before Scotland Yard. To her utter horror, she is partnered with the infamous Inspector Thomas Lynley. Apart from having a well-known reputation as a rogue, he also happens to be the eight earl of Asherton, which only widens the barrier between the staunch, blue collar Barbara. He isn't his usual carefree self either. He's just watched his best friend marry his ex-fiance and seen them off on their honeymoon. The case? Set your mind to the gray, windy moors of Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. There, in the sleepy Yorkshire village of Keldale, a respectable farmer and his dog are found decapitated inside a barn. Seated next to the headless body, is the farmer's daughter. Found in her best dress and an axe in her lap, her only words when she is found are ""I did it. And I'm not sorry."" Open and shut case? I think not! The village priest and locals maintain that as sweet and caring as she was, Roberta Teys couldn't have possibly murdered her own father in such a brutal way. What follows is a careful investigation into dark closets and past sins. What makes this book so much more than a Scotland Yard mystery is George's ability to marry historical and literary elements with the here and now. It's amazing! I didn't expect to find so many allusions to Shakespeare and the Brontes, or that they would be critical to understanding the whole case. Check this book out sometime. If you don't have the patience, I recommend the BBC's The Inspector Lynley Mysteries television series.",47,1 comment
31374,A Great Deliverance,Margitte,"1,142",485,4,"November 17, 2016","OFFICIAL BLURBTo this day, the low, thin wail of an infant can be heard in Keldale's lush green valleys. Three hundred years ago, as legend goes, the frightened Yorkshire villagers smothered a crying babe in Keldale Abbey, where they'd hidden to escape the ravages of Cromwell's raiders.Now into Keldale's pastoral web of old houses and older secrets comes Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley, the eighth earl of Asherton. Along with the redoubtable Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, Lynley has been sent to solve a savage murder that has stunned the peaceful countryside. For fat, unlovely Roberta Teys has been found in her best dress, an axe in her lap, seated in the old stone barn beside her father's headless corpse. Her first and last words were ""I did it. And I'm not sorry.""Yet as Lynley and Havers wind their way through Keldale's dark labyrinth of secret scandals and appalling crimes, they uncover a shattering series of revelations that will reverberate through this tranquil English valley—and in their own lives as well. Susan Elizabeth George is an American author writing murder mysteries set in Great Britain. She's doing a good job, since she mastered the English dialogue so well, that I would never have suspected her being American.A friend gave me the first book as a gift, and after finishing it, I ventured off into the author's other works, just to discover that it was the beginning of 19 books in this Inspector Lynley series. Digging deeper into the history of the series, I also discovered that it was turned into a popular television series, covering several seasons. Let's face it, the Brits love their murder mysteries and they know how to bring these stories alive. I'm really a sucker for it. Cannot leave them alone.The easy flow of the plot and story line keeps the reader committed to the prose. It reminds me of the cozy Agatha Christie novels. The author managed to built accurate characters. For instance, Scotland Yard Inspector Thomas Lynley is truly noble in his conduct, apart from having the appropriate bloodline as well. Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers acts authentically as a product of the lower income groups with less veneer and polish. Her people-skills are also a problem in her interaction with the public.Since I am not a fan or groupie of the British class system, I couldn't care less who were blessed by birth to be better than the rest of us, thus did not get excited about the possible lords and ladies tripling down the word-lanes of this narrative. I also did not hail Barbara Havers as the ultimate representative of the working class, due to her unresolved issues driving me a little bit bonkers. That doesn't mean that her character was not authentic, on the contrary. The overall emphasizing of the class system should have been expected, we're in Britain after all, but it did scratch my back with a steel brush from time to time. And then there was the depiction of the poor  fat (and) unlovely Roberta Teys as a mortally despicable soul. All the grown ups in the village were guilty of her condition and her conduct. Nobody cared to listen when she tried to find some help. The only solution she had to protect herself, was to eat....and eat.... and eat. When she was finally successful and the focus moved from her to someone else she loved, she made a plan on her own. The grown ups turned their heads away from the revolting, obese little girl, hoping the problem will go away. They turned their backs on a lonely scared little girl. She had no one to trust. It makes me wonder: are you allowed by society, or by yourself, to have chubby, happy-faced obese friends? No? Well, it's a sad world we're living in, isn't it?So yes, my hackles were a bit up with these insecure anti-obesity lot, a bunch of scoundrels if you ask me, and that includes the Catholic priest. But that's my problem. Everybody in the world has problems, that one is mine, for sure.And then I wonder: if you decapitate someone in self defense, can it be regarded as murder? I don't think so. Even if it was premeditated, I probably would have been an accomplice in this instance! Worse, if I was in on the deal, some people, and I am not naming names here, would have hanged from the rafters by their stems, like pumpkins.Now, that was not the main focus of my reading experience. It's just a 'so by the way' - observation. The overall experience was a good one. I enjoyed it. And I will certainly read the second book. After that I will have to see...But really, any murder mystery groupie, like yours truly, will simply grab onto this series and release the breaks! Just go for it. It's one of the best!",43,13
31374,A Great Deliverance,Icewineanne,228,68,4,"February 7, 2018","A 61 yr old farmer lies in his barn, brutally murdered, his head chopped off......the head lying a few yards from the body, where it had rolled after being severed. His grossly obese daughter sits beside his headless body, seated on a stool, holding the bloody axe that killed him and says “I did it. I’m not sorry.” Or did she......?Two unlikely detectives from New Scotland Yard are paired together to solve the case. Inspector 'Lord Asherton’ Lynley is a wealthy upper class handsome man, while Sergeant Havers is a working class, unattractive, bitter, woman who has a history of not getting along with any of her previous Inspectors. This odd pairing adds to the tension as they both graple with their demons & each other while trying to solve the case.Elizabeth George was an english teacher and it shows in her writing. She includes many classic literary references in this book to such works as The Picture of Dorian Gray, Phantom of the Opera, The Tennant of Wildfell Hall & Shakespeare’s Peneles;“One sin, I know, another doth provoke Murders as near to lust as flame to smoke”A very good story with compelling characters and an ending that shocked & surprised me. Highly recommended",34,17
31374,A Great Deliverance,Richard Derus,"2,855",1884,4,"September 11, 2017","Rating: 4 solid stars of fiveThe Publisher Says: To this day, the low, thin wail of an infant can be heard in Keldale's lush green valleys.

The author is very assured as she tells the story of a murder in an idyllic North Country village, one that seems from the start to be open-and-shut. As always in a mystery, though, there are many many twists and turns to the tale. Family secrets from every imaginable quarter. Horrible crimes past, as well as present, suppurate through the skin of the story, causing the characters to blanch regularly. (Readers too.) Lynley, an urbane and polished public school/Oxford First beauty, comes alive as a wounded man of many facets and a sharp, critical eye. His emotional acuity is high order; his past, as we know it so far, explains that quite well. Havers, who here in the first book is presented in all her hideous glory as receiving a Very Last Chance at being permanently assigned to Scotland Yard's prestigious Criminal Investigation Division, seems hell-bent for leather on tossing the opportunity away because, as Lynley says, ""{she's} mad at him"" and justifiably so.But, in patented mystery fashion, miscreants are punished and those less culpable find some measure of relief from their hideous, tormented sadness. Hard to argue with those results since they occur so seldom in reality.Is murder always wrong? Can you be sure of your answer? I know I've never been able to be absolutist about the topic. Reading this book, I felt absolutism and unimpeded judgment flapping their flightless wings desperately, sensing their ever-deeper immersion into the stock-pot of my subconscious.I don't know about you, but there are times I think a good murdering rampage would do the world a power of good. Problem is, the bad guys have the weapons.And reading this book, well, I just don't know that justice as practiced by the courts and described by the laws can really do a good enough job. And believe you me, that thought scares the bejabbers out of me. It makes me think about the nature of crime, and of punishment, and of the intersection of the two; it makes me afraid of the apparently boundless human capacity to commit horrible acts; and it makes me think hard about what I want out of my time on this planet...and whether I'm doing a single thing to make that want become fact.A very great deliverance indeed, this book. In entertaining me, it also grew me up a little more.

31374,A Great Deliverance,Jennifer,"1,710",46,1,"March 29, 2012","I was surprised to dislike this book intensely. I'd not read (or seen) any Inspector Lynley and I was expecting to enjoy this tale of an aristocrat police detective. It's the first in the series and sometimes the first outing is not the best whilst an author is establishing characters but I am really not sure I can bear to try another unless the author has been given a sound talking-to and promised to reform. It has left my teeth feeling as if the enamel has been stripped off.I can cut the plot itself some slack because it is now over 20 years old and in the intervening years we have all become a lot wiser and sadder about similar real life situations and the journey to the conclusion we'd already arrived at and dismissed as too blinking obvious was satisfyingly twisty. There were some glimmers of interesting potential threads which may or may not progress in a more satisfactory manner in later novels but too many were piled onto this first in the series.For the rest... it was just offensive somehow, from the completely unrealistic depiction of police procedure (I got very confused at the beginning, I assumed it was a period piece rather than intended to be contemporary) to the way in which women are described. I felt that the relentless emphasis on the pitiable loathsomeness of several female characters crossed a boundary for me... and the portrayal of the American dentist probably should have done. I think the overall idea is to have some theme of the British class system running through the series and it could have worked if it hadn't been handled in such a crass overblown manner.What a disappointment!",32,6
31374,A Great Deliverance,Allison,545,566,2,"July 28, 2018","First the superficial. I'm having a hard time getting over how annoying a couple of the characters were. The horribly caricatured American tourist was too much - I ended up skipping any passage with him. And felt he was completely unnecessary to the plot. It's difficult to enjoy a book when you have such antipathy to ridiculous characters. I did like Lynley, but his partner... I'm sure that she will get better as the series progresses, but did she really have to shriek and shrill so much? And shouldn't a police sergeant have a bit more control over herself?To be fair, it was written in the 1980s, and suffers some from the trends of the time. It dwells far too long on psycho-babble and torturous interpersonal relationships and family problems, and moves onto fairly explicit descriptions of sexual abuse, which didn't come across as that much worse than everyone else's psychological turmoil. Everyone's internal struggles seemed highly exaggerated, except for the actual victims of crimes. Ok, so maybe I didn't like it all that much? But I liked Lynley. Keep Lynley and ditch the rest, and we might have something I don't cringe to read.",26,N/A
31374,A Great Deliverance,Christi M,345,55,4,"January 11, 2022","My first introduction to the Inspector Lynley series was book 9. I read it years and years ago when my father handed it to me and told me to try it out. Later I might have watched an episode or two of the show, but don't remember a single thing from it. Now that I have finished the first book, I can clearly see why the series caught the attention of so many. The characters of Lynley and Havers have so much complexity to them. Their personality and moods display in so many shades that they really put to shame many other inspectors/sergeant's in the same genre. Havers wants to do well and succeed in her job, but cannot control her anger. It's no wonder she's like this considering parents are often the ones who teach us how to maturely handle stress and frustration and hers seem like perhaps they weren't able to model that behavior effectively for her. Lynley seems to be a caring individual, but lives with regrets. I believe there is still more to learn about him.I listened to this on audio, but it was much more than just a simple narration. My version was the one by Donada Peters who expertly narrated the story. But it was when we reached the emotional climax of the story - the part where we get to the heart of everything and why the murder occurred that I realized how incredibly good Donada was. She wasn't narrating. She was acting. Acting out the trauma of the character. Acting out the mood of the character, the reasoning, the anger, the sadness, the guilt, the...everything. It was gut-wrenching and heart-breaking to listen to. I was stunned. I still am stunned. I think back to it and realize how emotionally draining it must have been for Donada to read and act out this part of the book. She poured it all out. And it was wonderful.I will probably continue on in the series. My only quibble (well, just the one I will mention) I wasn't a fan at-all of the American tourist/dentist. He seemed to be a caricature, but of what I'm not sure. But he was awful and shouldn't have been created the way he was. But I am eager to learn more about Lynley and Havers and when I do, it will absolutely be on audio.Rating: 4 stars",24,3
31374,A Great Deliverance,Mary Beth ,377,1593,4,"August 15, 2014","I finished this book last night and I was filled with mixed emotions. After reading this I thought Is it O.K. to murder someone? Even though I could never do this, I now have a different view on this question. The ending was just full of horror. It was almost too much for me to handle. I really did like the book though.  This book starts out with Inspector Lynley of Scotland Yard in a village of Keldale, investigating a murder there with Sergeant Barbara Havers. Sergeant Havers gets demoted from her job because she can't get along with others. She is very unpleasant to work with, and the William Tey's murder case is her last chance to prove herself. If she messes up she will be left without a job. There is a problem though, Havers can't stand Inspector Lynley who is known as the Golden Boy and is a womanizer. They are both opposites as Lynley is very good looking and wealthy and Havers lives in poverty and is dumpy and just ordinary.Roberta Teys is found in her best dress, an axe in her lap, seated in the stone barn beside her Father's. corpse. Her first and last words were I did it, and I am not sorry. Roberta is sent to the Barnstingham Mental Asylum by her cousin Richard Gibson who inherits William Teys farm. When Inspector Lynley and Haver's meet their destination in Keldale, the village is deserted. The peaceful village becomes the site of romantic rivalries and deep dark secrets. It seems that William Teys is very well liked in his community. Why would his young wife Tessa abandon him and her two daughters? Why would Gillian, Roberta older sister run away at the age of sixteen and never come back. Also there is the matter of the baby ghost whose cries originate from the stones of ancient Keldale Abbey. The people in Keldale are determined to make this a hard investigation for the unlikely pair!",24,23
31374,A Great Deliverance,James,"1,224",42,1,"December 20, 2012","I wavered between strongly disliking this book, actively despising the author and reading it in a compulsive how could this get any worse kind of way. The plot in brief: a lord who for reasons unknown works in scotland yard is paired up with a working class police woman to solve a grisly decapitation in Yorkshire. I understand some suspension of belief is par for the course when you read a crime thriller and that the depth of character plotting is not a universal strength of the genre. But there are limits to what one can stomach. In this book the stereotypes are so wooden that they creak slowly before expiring under the weight of accumulated cliches. The Americans are coarse, the aristocrats are splendid, the villagers are lusty, the working class resentful and in need of guidance from their betters blah di blah. One possible explanation is that the author read cold comfort farm and thought it was a documentary, then was force fed mills and boon and Agatha Christie until this grotesque caricature was spewed out made even stupider by the fact that everyone acts like they were based in 1930s England that only PG Woodhouse ever imagined but it is set in the 1980s. The other possible explanation is that the author has no shame and a tenuous grip on reality.Even weirder is that these stock stereotypes are raging hormonal messes who self articulate their emotions in a continuous inner dialogue that is wince inducing.The worst bit is that the last 5 pages are actually rather decent and this could have been an ok thriller instead of intellectual excrement.

31374,A Great Deliverance,Andrea,253,17,1,"August 20, 2017","I had the terrible misfortune of reading this book this weekend, and I fervently wish that I could unread it so I could have two days of my life back. You, too, could read it, if you want the nonstop sex of a Law & Order: SVU, the shocking ickyness of a V.C. Andrews, and the fascinating character development of a basket of sock puppets.This aggravating novel stars:- Man Too Rich and Sexy For His Own Good (Who Can't Have the Woman of His Dreams :( boohoo)- Stubborn Woman With No Sex Appeal and Therefore No Self-Esteem (Who Has Family Issues At Home :( boohoo)- a petite harem of women who want to sleep with aforementioned Man, described in such a flurry of breasts and thighs that I wondered whether we were discussing humans or fried chicken- English folks too poor and uneducated to do anything but fuck all day - including family members who are actively fucking / want to fuck each other; people who fuck to make other people jealous; and couples who make it abundantly clear that instead of being interviewed about a murder, they would rather be fucking- and a dead dog.Charming it is not. Clever? Not by a long shot. Literary masterpiece? Nah.I don't know about you, but I'm headed back to my safe microcosm of witty, fun, slightly more cheerful whodunits set in pre-1960s English countryside and starring either men too old or girls too young to be boning all the fucking time.",20,N/A
31374,A Great Deliverance,fleurette,"1,304",107,4,"January 21, 2022","I was surprised by this story for more than one reason.First, I didn't expect this story to be so dark. The resolution of a few threads is really somber. For some reason, I expected it to be something of a cozy mystery. Although I am not sure why. The fact that Lynley and Havers are solving the case where the daughter killed her father by chopping his head off with an ax should give some hints. Motivations of the various characters are often quite dark, and the secrets that come to light are also often filled with violence. You will find some really tough scenes.So, if you're looking for a light and fun story about small-town crimes, this isn't that kind of book. Especially if you are sensitive to sexual or child abuse, don't read it.Another thing that surprised me are the main characters. They are much more psychologically complicated than I initially thought. Havers, for example, is an exceptionally interesting woman, also because I'm not sure if I like her. But I think the author wanted to achieve just such an effect. On the one hand, we find Havers unpleasant and unkind, and on the other hand, we feel sorry for her because life is not easy for her and she is very lonely. Lynley is also much more complicated than I expected. I like that the author has given him other features as well, and it is not only that he likes women and is an aristocrat. I am very curious how their further work relations will develop and whether they will ever become friends or even lovers.Overall, I liked this story very much. The complicated characters, both the pair of main characters and the townspeople, added a fascinating element to the story. The plot was also really exciting. A lot of things surprised me. I was truly into this story.I am adding another book in this series to my tbr pile. I definitely recommend it, especially to those who are looking for some really dark secrets in a small quiet town.",19,N/A
31374,A Great Deliverance,Anu,364,883,5,"October 11, 2016","I've been in a book slump for the longest time. Well, I've been in a slump in general, for the longest time. I'd been having ""one of those days"" for the past couple of weeks, and this book got me out of it. I was apprehensive about starting this book after the disappointment that was J.D. Robb, but this did not disappoint. Elizabeth George is an exceptional writer. She pens what seems, from the onset, a cosy mystery, a la Ms. Marple or the likes, but gradually turns out to be something much darker and more sinister. She takes time to build her characters, and the story itself; she has the knack of portraying her characters as realistic, rather than as empty shells of people merely existing to progress the story. Each of her characters have both good and bad attributes to them; you can't really hate any of them. This book marks the introduction of the characters that spawned the popular PBS detective series based on the titular Inspector Lynley, and his friends and foes. Inspector Lynely is the proverbial prodigal son, the golden boy - Eton-and-Oxford educated, attractive, and an Earl, no less. Reputed for his impeccable suits as much as for his skills as a cop, he is paired with the frumpish, difficult, and self-loathing Sgt. Barbara Havers. Havers is, as it is always in tales like this, the polar opposite of Lynley. Think Andy Sachs from The Devil Wears Prada, but as a cop. Thirty year old Barb lives with her parents on the ""wrong side of Acton"" in utter mediocrity. Her parents are, it seems from the beginning, slightly crazy. Also weak and frail, both physically and emotionally. The reasons, of course, are mentioned later in the novel, but one can't but wonder...Due to her innate inability to work well with others, she was demoted from the CID, but is paired with our good Inspector to travel to the beautiful countryside of York to solve what seems to be the gruesome murder of a man by his daughter. Eager to prove her chops, she sets out to perform reasonably well during the course of the investigation, only to, for lack of a better word, fuck up, because of her bitterness and anger. That is not to say that she doesn't do her bit for the case; she does. If I had to fault Ms. George for anything, it would be for Barb's excruciatingly annoying inner monologue. Barb is not only self-deprecating, she also hates everyone and everything else in the world. While I would forgive such bitterness in a 16 year-old, it doesn't bode well with me when the character is about twice that age. Having said that, I also kind of understand where the self-loathing comes from, so I don't completely blame her. Also in the novel, are newly-weds Simon and Deborah St. James, characters that I came to adore; similar were my feelings towards Lady Helen Clyde, Lynley's special lady friend. Ms. George teaches you that with a little help from your friends, anything is possible. Even apprehending a ""cold-blooded killer"". Wonderfully interwoven with references and elements from popular gothic novels, especially the Bronte novels, A Great Deliverance hits all the right notes. There is, of course, also the curious incident of the dog at the nighttime. There is definite comic relief provided in the novel, by way of Hank and JoJo somethingortheother, two over the top, crass Americans totally taken by the ""English charm"" and looking for the ""verified, certified poop"" about everything they come across. Ms. George plays wonderfully with the dry elements of British humour that I have come to love in such novels. It's hard to believe that she's actually American. There's elements of goth and horror in the book, also, but in its essence, the book remains a classic whodunit that will leave you saying ""damn, I could've seen that coming, but I didn't.""",19,8
