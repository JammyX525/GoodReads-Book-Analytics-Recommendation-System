352921,A Fatal Grace,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),525,56600,2,"January 7, 2022","(2.5) I was warned that the first two books in this series were rough and to start with book three. I'm stubborn so I didn't.I love the small village vibes, I love a lot of the characters there, the main Inspector and the French Canadian bits made me feel at home.I struggled with this book so much because of the rest. Most of the characters are REALLY unlikeable (and that's coming from someone who loves those!). The fatphobia was INTENSE. The murder mystery was underwhelming but at least it's a quick read.I want to believe the series does in fact get better but it will probably take me quite a while to pick up the next book.",252,30
352921,A Fatal Grace,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",932,17600,5,"January 15, 2023","Louise Penny is a Supernova in the Canadian literary firmament. And her warmth and human compassion is especially endearing, as is her supercharged inspiration in concocting such an endlessly labyrinthine structure for her book. Her writing is excellent. And enchanting.I loved it.But why do its premises draw me into a dangerously dead-ended pattern of thinking?Let me explain. Isn’t this yet another return to the flawed Golden Age Theory? The novel is great, but this idea bugs me.The mythical Québec village of Three Pines, with its country-club coziness among the chief residents, nestled as it is so quaintly in the Eastern Townships, is an Eldorado which calls out to principal players like Gamache, CC, and Saul to rest in its eternal Shangri-la - like the island of the Lotus Eaters in Homer.It’s the Sunset World of Trungpa’s classic Shambhala. A place of moral entropy. Welcome to the Hotel California!And in the master’s chambersThey all gather for the FeastThey stab it with their steely knivesBut they just can’t kill the Beast.The beast is never a stranger here. For a foggy moral cloud hangs over Three Pines, and murderous evil always returns, unseen.Oh, there indeed is rest here, though - a bit, and some stupor too. But there is no clear-eyed judgement on the part of the residents.It’s a lot like one of those Florida senior villages, where the staff always tries to shut out all the nasty shadows of life.But life’s shadows are an essential part of relishing the refreshment of clear sunlight - there... and here.And double toil and trouble for all the villagers, as a result. And Gamache too, God bless’m! They have no ethical vigor, as Poirot and Miss Marple once had in ABUNDANCE!And so must pay the piper.For -Into many a green valleyDrifts the appalling snow...The glacier knocks in the cupboard,The desert sighs in the bed,And the crack in the tea-cup opensA lane to the land of the dead.THAT is the Real Three Pines. A lot like a “happy” seniors’ home!So why not call it by its real name? Well, simple. That would steal all the romance and adventure from Penny’s wonderful plot. And that would be too bad.So I hope my little wistful Jeremiad doesn’t seem too out of place in a five star review. Cause I really loved the book.And if you read this book you’ll LOVE it as I did - IF you believe the Shadow ALWAYS haunts us all!",247,20
352921,A Fatal Grace,Adina,777,2943,4,"March 11, 2018","""So much more comforting to see bad in others; gives us all sorts of excuses for our own bad behavior. But good? No, only really remarkable people see the good in others.""A fatal grace is the 2nd installment in Inspector Armand Gamache cozy mystery series. In Still Life I was introduced to the inspector and his team and fell in love with Three Pines, the little village where the action takes place. Gamache is a chief inspector in the Sûreté du Québec, an honorable and complex character whose main approach to solving a murder is to listen. He has to return to Three Pines after a year and a half in order to solve another murder. This time, one of the most hated villagers is electrocuted in the middle of a frozen lake during a curling match and nobody seems to have seen anything and at first sight the crime seems impossible. In this volume I learned more about the personalities of Gamache and his team, about their past and their fears. Also, I enjoyed revisiting some of the villagers from last book: Gabri and Olivier- the heart-warming gay couple, Myrna- the librarian, Ruth - the cranky poet, Clara and Peter - the artists. They all feel like a big family and Gamache is received in with open arms among them due to his pleasant personality. ""Gamache was the best of them, the smartest and bravest and strongest because he was willing to go into his own head alone, and open all the doors there, and enter all the dark rooms. And make friends with what he found there.And he went into the dark, hidden rooms in the minds of others. The minds of killers. And he faced down whatever monsters came at him. ""The mystery was a bit more complex than last time and although I guessed the murderer from early on I enjoyed the ride and the plot twists. The writing is beautiful, poetic in places, and it managed to transport me to the snow covered Three Pines, a place I plan to revisit soon.Important! I believe this series should be read in order because we have a lot of personal details from all characters and conflicts that continue in the following volumes, there are references to the previous volumes so they might not be savoured so well read randomly",183,26
352921,A Fatal Grace,MarilynW,"1,032",2562,4,"February 27, 2022","A Fatal Grace (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache #2)by Louise Penny (Author), Ralph Cosham (Narrator)A Fatal Grace is the second book I've read in the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series and I'm ready for the next book. I thrive on all the snarky, not very nice, snide, inner thoughts of almost everyone. It's stream of consciousness going on from someone, almost all the time. Heck, I may remember a dog or two getting some thoughts in although it could be that I'm just remembering Gamache translating doggie thoughts. It took a long time for Gamache to make his entrance in this book but I'm getting to know the folks of Three Pines so I enjoy spending time with them, too. I didn't enjoy CC de Poitiers but no one likes CC. She lives in a fake world of delusions of grandeur and any time she can bring someone down, for even the most trivial or no reason, she's going to do it. And now, she has her sights on Three Pines. She plans to make that place hers, and in her mind, she plans to raze all that makes the place amazing. Something I think is very interesting is that Gamache did something in the past that ended any upward movement of his career. He accepts it and is a very happy guy anyway, either because of or in spite of continuous inner reflection. There is trouble brewing in the future and he knows it. People are scheming to take him down even further than a stalled career. I want to know more and I want to know what Gamache plans to do about it.Pub in 2014 by Macmillan Audio (first published September 30th 2006)",164,47
352921,A Fatal Grace,Thomas,689,164,4,"August 17, 2019","4 stars for an entertaining mystery.I enjoyed reading book 2 in this series, set in the mythical town of Three Pines, Quebec. This town is close to the US border in the Eastern Townships region of Quebec(between the St. Lawrence River and the US Vermont border). Armand Gamache, Chief Inspector of the Homicide Division of the Surete du Quebec, is called to investigate the death of CC de Poitiers, electrocuted in front of an entire village.He does solve the murder, and connects it with another murder in the city of Montreal, with the help of his dedicated team of excellent investigators. Along the way he uncovers some past secrets, which provide clues to the murders. I previously read book 1 in the series Still Life and recommend that you read it first. Book 1 was recommended by a family member and both my wife and I enjoy this series. There are a couple of characters that my wife really hated in this book. I read this library book in 3 days.One quote:""Because Armand Gamache knew something many of his colleagues never figured out. Murder was deeply human, the murdered and the murderer. To describe the murderer as a monstrosity, a grotesque, was to give him an unfair advantage. No. Murderers were human, and at the root of each murder was an emotion. Warped, no doubt. Twisted and ugly. But an emotion."" ",114,17
352921,A Fatal Grace,Elizabeth,"1,922",10,2,"March 26, 2015","The setup for this book is very long and the main thing the author established was how cruel some characters were and how others were affected by cruelty. This section was so unnecessarily long that I wanted to give up on the book. The only reason I didn't was because I really enjoyed the first book. The focus of the cruelty was on fat. And for a while it seemed that it was only the characters who were being cruel but then I read this passage about a 12 year old girl.And beside him an enormous child was wearing a sleeveless sundress of the brightest pink. Her underarms bulged and flopped and the rolls of her waist made the skintight dress look like a melting strawberry ice cream. It was grotesque.This is the author's description, not a characters. And to me it makes the author more grotesque than any 12 year old child could be. The fat comments tapered off after this but the damage has been done. I don't think I could continue to read an author who would use such strong terms to describe an abused child. It's grotesque.",110,29
352921,A Fatal Grace,Carol,"1,370",2120,4,"September 11, 2015","Have you ever been so dam cold that you could hardly move your frozen lips to talk? Having grown up in Michigan amidst many a freezing winter days, I have, and in A Fatal Grace, Louise Penny truly brings a chilling winter alive making the reader feel you are at the enchanted snowy village of Three Pines in Quebec.In book two, there's another murder to solve for Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his crew as the repulsively cruel CC De Poitiers is no more. Deliberately electrocuted, the villagers almost seem to be celebrating that the monster is dead and for good reason, but her death is linked to another sad loss nearby.I am so enjoying this series and look forward to reading the next nine. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for a fast easy-to-read crime-mystery with well-developed recurring characters (each with their own secrets) that you get to know better with each installment.",90,21
352921,A Fatal Grace,Susan - on semi hiatus,410,108,4,"November 11, 2021","Saving Grace. This book sealed the deal on my deciding to continue on with the series as I was nicely surprised by the second offering. I wasn’t sure about the first. While Inspector Gamache took his sweet time making an appearance, I was happily entertained with an abundance of snarky humor. No one was safe from gentle teasing to outright mockery.Armand Gamache and his cohorts were back in town because of another death in Three Pines. A VERY disagreeable woman was murdered by ‘Electric Chair’. Not just for executioners, this person figured the complicated logistics to carry it out and it was perplexing to all involved. I learned more about several returning characters along with new ones and I began to appreciate their ticks and nuances as the mystery unfolded. I was also interested in the continuing story of Gamache’s stalled career. I feel that the surface has been barely scratched in this sub-plot and I’m so curious as to how it will play out.Taking place at Christmas time, the winter descriptions would make this an excellent holiday read!I received my electronic copy from Kindle Unlimited.",65,28
352921,A Fatal Grace,Paula K (on hiatus),414,428,5,"July 17, 2015","Louise Penny is terrific. I'm a big fan of her Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series. A Fatal Grace, the 2nd of the series, takes a different path from the first book. More emotion, in depth character analysis, and what is perceived and what is really inside peoples minds. Different and beautiful. What wonderful prose. Listening to Ralph Cosham is such a pleasure. I'm only going with the audiobooks because of Cosham's voice and French Canadian accent.CC de Poitiers, the murder victim, has to be one of the most despicable characters written. She is hated by everyone. What makes this book so much fun is the opinions of the eccentric group of villages from Three Pines who return from the first book. Just delightful!I first read a more recent Gamache novel, How the Light Gets In. A GR friend (Susan) recommended I start from the beginning and read them all. How fortunate to get such good advice.Highly recommend.5 out of 5 stars.",58,15
352921,A Fatal Grace,Candi,598,4532,3,"November 1, 2018","""The monster’s dead and the villagers are celebrating.""It’s been some time, but I was happy to find myself back in Three Pines, the idyllic little community in Quebec that is peppered with interesting characters, as well as several secrets. CC de Poitiers is fairly new in town, and definitely not a friend to any – not even those who had tried to make an effort to welcome this hateful, self-centered woman. So when she was found murdered in the middle of a curling match, it’s no surprise that the townspeople are not mourning her death; rather there is a celebratory air in the village. Perhaps this is due in part to the approaching Christmas festivities, but certainly the removal of the town ‘bully’ must have something to do with the cheer. Chief Inspector Armand Gamache is summoned to assist with the case once again. Most of the residents were pleased to see him return, as was I. He is a charming man, and a fair and honest detective, a crackerjack in his profession.""Gamache was the best of them, the smartest and bravest and strongest because he was willing to go into his own head alone, and open all the doors there, and enter all the dark rooms. And make friends with what he found there. And he went into the dark, hidden rooms in the minds of others. The minds of killers. And he faced down whatever monsters came at him.""Along with the folks we met in the last installment, we are introduced to a few more. I liked reacquainting myself with the regulars and popping into the bistro and the cozy little homes again. Louise Penny allows a glimpse of the inner workings of several characters a bit more, and I found this refreshing. I suspect we’ll get to know them even more intimately with the next in the series. Something bigger than just the murder at hand seems to be brewing on the horizon - something with a sinister vibe that does not bode well for Gamache. I felt a little on edge about this! I guess it’s a thread that will perhaps run through the next several books, sort of tying them all together. I enjoyed Dead Cold , but not quite as much as I did the first, Still Life. The crime in this one was a bit out there, somewhat unbelievable. Regardless, I did have fun arriving at the solution and there was enough here to keep me interested in continuing. 3.5 stars rounded down""A layer of pure white was both beautiful and dangerous. You never really knew what lurked beneath. A Quebec winter could both enchant and kill.""",57,19
352921,A Fatal Grace,Phrynne,"3,111",1975,4,"March 6, 2017","Yet another of those books with two titles. A Fatal Grace or Dead Cold. Take your pick.Anyway whatever it is called it is an excellent book. I hate the cold, but love reading about places where the snow is metres deep and the water freezes on the end of the firemen's hoses as they try to put out a fire. Wow! Also the story takes place at Christmas in a picture perfect town where the snow sparkles in the sun and everyone drinks hot chocolate and eats cookies. What more does a book need?Actually of course it needs characters and this book does not lack anything in that area. There are characters galore, most of them slightly quirky or even quite outrageous. The main character,Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, is the ultimate in detective fiction heroes. He appears to have no faults and charms everyone he meets. Except for the few who hate him for reasons that are not totally clear yet. I expect to discover more in future books which I am really looking forward to!",56,6
352921,A Fatal Grace,Bryn (Plus Others),"1,836",14,1,"January 23, 2023","I realise I am a rare dissenter here, but this book was so awful it made my teeth hurt. It is a book in which the values the story claims to be promoting (compassion, love, generosity, respect for human dignity) are actually entirely undercut by the text itself. I think ten years ago I would have fallen in love with this series, because the lies it tells about doing good and doing evil are told in such pretty prose, with all the symbols of cosiness -- wood fires and snowfall, old friends gathering around candlelit tables, poetry and music and books. But the book itself is false all through.I am not sure this is a particularly coherent review, but here's a try about my problems with the book:The villain of the book is CC de Poitiers, who is a textbook destructive narcissist; she is delusional about her own abilities and importance, treats other people as disposable props in her glorious narrative, and viciously attacks anyone who fails to treat her with the proper breathless worship. She emotionally abuses her daughter (Crie) and husband, expresses contempt for her lover, and -- worst of all, the text says -- she wears boots made of baby sealskin, making her not merely a damaged, destructive human being but an actual monster who wears babies on her feet. All of this makes her the perfect Christie-style murder victim -- the reader is glad when she's dead, but justice must still be done, so there's the pleasure of the investigation without the grief of a sympathetic character dying, plus suspects are thick on the ground because everyone disliked her.But even while the book condemns CC's behaviour, it indulges in it. CC humiliates Crie about her weight and her clothes, but the narrative does the same, lingering over scenes of Crie's suffering and commenting constantly on her obesity. The narrative says that CC's abuse of Crie has erased her humanity, and uses Crie's weight as proof of that -- as if being overweight makes someone less than human. And indeed, even the 'good' characters (with the exception of Gamache) in the book fail to treat Crie as human; they spend a great deal of time talking about how terribly CC has treated her, about how difficult her life must be, but aside from Gamache nobody does anything -- no one is bringing casseroles to her family or telling her how lovely her voice is or inviting her to the bookstore to sit by the fire. She's there to be furniture for the plot, demonstrating CC's narcissism and Gamache's compassion, but never existing a human being in her own right. Even the revelation that she's intelligent, cunning, and desperate enough to have arranged her mother's ingenious murder is shown hand-in-hand with a portrayal of her in a catatonic fantasy not altogether different from CC's own narcissistic delusions. In the end the text reduces Crie to the symbol of her mother's evil, a reflection/victim of her mother's narcissism.That would be more than enough to make me annoyed by this book, but its treatment of the 'good' characters is just as bad -- even worse, in a way, because the nastiness of it is so much more covert. As I said above, the 'good' characters don't treat Crie as a human being -- they talk about her but they don't take any action to try to make things better for her. The exception is Gamache, but even here Crie is just a prop. Gamache treats her with some basic human decency -- putting a coat around her when she's cold, encouraging her to eat despite her mother's death -- and the book treats this as behaviour that's so saintly it bewilders onlookers, who can't understand how anyone could bother to put a coat on a cold child's shoulders. It's bizarre, but very integral to how Penny writes her characters; there's always someone watching the good characters (such as Gamache and Clara) 'being good' and either adoring them or being confused by their goodness. Whether or not a character is good or bad is shown by whether they adore Gamache for his goodness, like Beauvoir, or dislike and distrust it, like Nichols. These people never act silently; there's always an audience, so there's always a pay-off -- when Clara does an act of, again, basic human kindness (in giving Elle/L some food) she ends up believing that God has personally come to earth to reassure her about her art. She's not just an ordinary person trying to do something kind, she's receiving a message from God -- and the reader is supposed to find this random belief charming, and CC's beliefs in Li Bien toxic, because Clara is a Good Person and CC is a Bad Person.In the actual world, good and evil are all mixed up. People like CC de Poitiers exist, but in between their bouts of rage and shaming and humiliation they buy birthday cakes and pet dogs and sing along with the radio; that's why dealing with them is so destructive, because they are still people. By the same token, people do exist who struggle to be generous, compassionate, kind and loving, who ignore homeless people and then feel bad about it and go back to bring them coffee -- but they don't get epiphanies as a result, and they don't have an admiring audience constantly thinking about how wonderful they are. I hated this book because in Penny's world everyone sorts out so neatly, and after they're sorted out what they do doesn't matter. I was shocked by Clara ignoring the homeless woman when she's supposed to be so loving and generous and connected, but nobody else was. I was shocked by Gamache not actually trying to help Crie, but all the characters were shocked that he did. What kind of world is this, when the expectation is that everyone is a self-entitled jerk, and doing anything else makes you a saint? Awful, awful, awful. ",49,19
352921,A Fatal Grace,Matt,"3,613",12800,4,"October 18, 2018","Louise Penny returns with a second novel in the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache series, just as riveting and captivating as the debut piece that offered the reader so much! While many of the familiar residents of Three Pines are in Montreal to shop for the holiday season, a newer family has begun to set-up some roots of their own in this bucolic town nestled in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. CC de Poitiers heads this family, a woman who takes no prisoners and seeks to crush those in her way, including a timid husband and emotionally abused daughter. CC is talk of the town, though not for anything she has done, even though she’d be happy to espouse her new-age way of living. During his annual Boxing Day Cold Case review, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache explores those cases the Homicide Division of the Sûreté du Québec might have overlooked. Embedded in the piles is a new case, that of a homeless woman who was found murdered just before Christmas. While not known personally to Gamache or his wife, her presence in Montreal’s downtown core could not be missed. When a call interrupts Gamache’s further exploration of the woman’s murder, it’s all hands on deck and back out to Three Pines, a journey about which the Chief Inspector has mixed feelings. When they arrive in one of the surrounding towns, the body of CC de Poitiers has been found, electrocuted. As Gamache and his Sûreté team begin digging through CC’s life, they cannot help but notice the truly Canadian surroundings, for this wretched woman died at a local curling event, having gripped the end of her chair, one that was seemingly attached to a sizeable generator. As Gamache and the others notice the raw distaste that others had for CC, they cannot help but wonder why much of CC’s life cannot be substantiated. Might she have been hiding something bigger, something even more disgusting than the tidbits she puts on display? And what of this vagrant woman that caught Gamache’s attention earlier in the week? All this and much more as Three Pines envelopes Gamache and the reader for another stunning mystery. Highly recommended for those who want a ‘quieter’ murder mystery with tons of Canadiana embedded in the narrative. I am enjoying the early stages of my Louise Penny binge, having found something that is not only unique, but captivating in its descriptive power. Penny uses not only the peaceful Eastern Townships as her setting, but continues to provide the reader with some great character development of Armand Gamache, a man whose intellect is balanced with a compassionate side. The reader learns a sliver more about his family life, with a loving wife and an extended family who cannot comprehend his need to work so much. This slow reveal, sandwiched between the current cases, keeps me wanting to learn more, yet take a moment to see the protagonist develop before my eyes. Penny continues to explore the larger Sûreté Homicide team, including some quirks in the hierarchy and some new faces, sure to stir the pot in ways that might not have been expected in such a quaint novel. It is the collection of Three Pines locals who steal the show—as I was told they would by the friend who recommended this series—with their acerbic wit and jabs at one another. This patchwork quilt of personalities keeps the story from getting too dreary, though Penny does offer much in the way of backstory and character development, such that I am going to have to keep things straight to learn all their nuances. The story moves well in this piece, with a few moments of chronological disorder to lay some of the groundwork for the murder and how CC could be so horrid a woman. Penny ensures the reader is in the middle of the investigation, watching Gamache’s mind spin as more information comes to light at key moments in the narrative. I am well on my way to a successful binge, with a new novel set to come out soon. Bring on more Penny and keep them coming!Kudos, Madam Penny, for intriguing me greatly. I am eager to see what else you have in store for this series.Like/hate the review?
