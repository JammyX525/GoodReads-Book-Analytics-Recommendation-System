Weeding unwanted plants may seem a tedious work for a man who experienced astonishing events still this is his wish, the tranquil life no problems just live... During this era honored saints bones are displayed in churches , abbeys and religious institutions to bring the faithful and they will leave a gratuity, it is the rage, prosperity, fame for anyone fortunate enough to find them, the cults spring up to benefit all they believe.

321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Julie ,"3,989",58900,3,"February 25, 2020","A Morbid Taste for Bones by Ellis Peters is a 2014 Mysterious Press/ Open Road Media publication. (This book was originally published in 1977) I have been curious about this series for a very long time. I love the Medieval period in history so it should be right up my alley. The series is a long one- with at least twenty installments, which is one reason why it has taken me this long to finally take the plunge. Thankfully, my Kindle Unlimited subscription paid off, so now it will be easy for me to finally get started on this series. In 1137, the head of Shrewsbury Abbey is compelled to acquire the remains of Saint Winifred, which will add some prestige to their Benedictine status. So, an expedition to Wales is arranged, of which Brother Cadfael is a part of. However, upon arrival, they are greeted with some opposition. But things really take a sinister turn, when the main protestor is found murdered. It is now up to Brother Cadfael to root out the killer and the true motive behind the murder.These books are super short, but this first installment seemed to move at a very slow pace. Although the premise is interesting, the story didn’t really draw me in until the last quarter of the book. I also struggled a bit with the sentence structuring at times, unsure if it was meant to read that way or if there was a formatting issue. Brother Cadfael’s character eventually grew on me as the story progressed. The wry humor is a nice touch and the mystery did have a few interesting developments. The author also added some rich details, which was enough to encourage me to try the second installment in the series to see how it progresses from here. Overall, I wasn’t really disappointed in the book, per se, just a little underwhelmed by it. Still, I think it shows some promise, although I shall proceed from here, with cautious optimism. ",110,30
321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,BlackOxford,"1,081",67800,4,"August 17, 2020","Affectionate SarcasmThis first Cadfael story is about clerical arrogance, deceit, vanity, pettiness, ambition, vengefulness, and ultimately homicide in a 12th century monastic community. It also touches on idolatry and superstition in medieval Britain. And it makes several clever swipes at clerical celibacy and misogyny, miracles, religious piety, and the efficacy of prayer. Yet for all that it cannot be judged anti-religious. It is clearly a work in which there is an underlying appreciation for the ideals of medieval Catholic culture.Edith Pargeter’s skill in carrying off such apparently contradictory intentions is probably what makes her Cadfael series so popular. What she endorses about Christianity is unstated but understood. It is the character of Cadfael himself, who after a rather full life of adventure - sexual as well as geographical - finds monastic life and its routines to be just what he needs. It is through his eyes that all the deficiencies of the Church are observed and recorded. And yet he implicitly assures the reader that it remains a worthwhile institution.There is more than a touch of Pre-Raphaelite sentimentality in Pargeter’s prose (captured rather well I think in the cover of my edition). Nevertheless it is impossible for me at my stage in life to disagree with Cadfael’s express motivation for adopting the lowly status of monk: “When you have done everything else, perfecting a conventual herb-garden is a fine and satisfying thing to do.” I understand entirely.Postscript: I suspect that Pargeter’s St. Winifred is based on the legend of the 12th century St. Frideswide, patron saint of Oxford. The famous Pre-Raphaelite stained glass artist, Edward Burne-Jones, created a large window in Oxford’s Christ Church Cathedral in 1858 depicting scenes from her life. The last of these has various of her devotees surrounding her deathbed (see below). In the background Burne-Jones has placed a modern porcelain flush toilet. Pargeter emulates just this sort of tongue in cheek humour in her story.

321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Candi,598,4532,4,"November 21, 2017","""Justice can be arrived at by more routes than one.""I thought this book was a swell start to this series! Brother Cadfael, monk by vocation and detective by circumstance, is a really delightful character. A medieval-time, Welsh-born man, Cadfael now carries out his monastic duties at Shrewsbury Abbey in England. He has not been in the service of the church his entire life, however, and that is what makes him such an intriguing fellow. ""For Brother Cadfael had come late to the monastic life, like a battered ship settling at last for a quiet harbour."" A former soldier and captain of a ship, Cadfael has even experienced his fair share of sweethearts – ""he remembered other ladies, in more lands than one, with whom he had enjoyed encounters pleasurable to both parties, and no harm to either."" You can’t help but adore this guy!While Brother Cadfael may be well-liked, author Ellis Peters also introduces us to some less agreeable characters as well. Prior Robert cuts a splendid and authoritative figure, and is well aware of this fact. ""For whatever virtues might be found in Prior Robert, humility was not one, nor magnanimity. He was invariably sure of his own rightness, and where it was challenged he was not a forgiving man."" The prior’s latest ambition is to acquire the relics of a saint in order to advance the prestige of the monastery. Thus begins an adventure to Wales in search of the resting place of Saint Winifred. Prior Robert bands together a small group of his monks to carry out his mission, Brother Cadfael among them due to his Welsh background. He will serve as translator between the Shrewsbury brothers and the people of Gwytherin. Upon their arrival at Gwytherin, the monks quickly realize that despite the fact the saint’s grave has been neglected, the villagers are not necessarily keen to give her up to a group of strangers. Here we meet another group of interesting men and women; Peters certainly delivers in her characterizations! I loved that she also included a strong female figure in a young woman named Sioned. Brother Cadfael is not without a great sense of respect and admiration for her as well. ""There are women as strong as any of us, and as able."" When a leading citizen of this quaint Welsh village turns up dead, Cadfael will put to use his sleuthing skills to ensure that justice is served. But this unconventional monk will not necessarily do everything by the book, making for an intriguing, sometimes humorous, and very enjoyable read. I’ve had A Morbid Taste for Bones waiting for me on my kindle for quite some time now. I dillydallied about actually reading it, thinking that a book about an assortment of monks could be either a snooze fest or too heavy on the religion (I was wrong!) When a GR friend chose this book for me as part of a book swap, I finally jumped right in. I am so glad that I did, because I have now found a fabulous, new-to-me, historical mystery series to indulge in – thanks, Jen! Recommended to those that love historical mysteries with an appealing and bit out of the ordinary leading man.",77,35
321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,PattyMacDotComma,"1,365",784,3,"March 17, 2022","3.5★“Not all the time they were together there would be spent in prayer. They would be considering what arguments would be most likely to carry the day with Father Huw's free assembly, or what oblique ecclesiastical threats daunt them into submission.”The year is 1137. Brother Cadfael has chosen a monastic life, tending to the gardens, but only after having had a full and exciting career in battles and as part of the Crusades. His monastery is very modest and has no claims to fame, no source of power, so to speak.Then, one of the monks stands up during a service, proclaiming rather wildly that St Winifred came to him in a dream, asking that the brothers rescue her bones from the small Welsh graveyard where she was buried. “Through the murmur of excitement that went round the chapter-house, Prior Robert's voice rose in reverent triumph: ‘Father Abbot, we are being guided! Our quest for a saint has drawn to us this sign of favour, in token that we should persevere.’”Abbot Heribert is willing to send a group, along with Brother Columbanus, a young monk seemingly afflicted with fits of some sort. Brother Cadfael, being Welsh, is sent along as an interpreter. Some of the leaders would speak Latin, of course, but that wasn’t in common use by others.When they get to Wales, they need to figure out how to convince the locals to relinquish the relics, to coin a phrase. After all, if the bones have hidden powers (this is 1137, remember), then why would the Welsh want them to go to England? Thus, the brothers need to consider not only what arguments might be useful with Welsh Father Huw’s people, but also how they can imply that if they don’t do the bidding of St Winifred, they could be leaving themselves open to all kinds of trouble. Veiled threats, but not too thinly veiled.These were the days when rulers and church leaders could threaten people with fire and brimstone, torture, pestilence, plagues. You name it, anything awful that happened would be attributed to some oversight on your part that could be atoned for through prayer and payment. These days, our ‘leaders’ threaten us with higher prices, steeper debt, and poorer lifestyle under their opponents.But back to the beautiful Welsh countryside.“‘The parish stretches for several miles along the river valley, and a mile or more from the Cledwen on either bank. We do not congregate in villages as you English do. Land good for hunting is plentiful, but good for tillage meagre. Every man lives where best suits him for working his fields and conserving his game.’”So how is Cadfael to get to know the people? There doesn't seem to be a village. Still, they meet the same way we do, over a drink.“Now what I really need here, he thought as he walked back towards the church of Gwytherin, is a good, congenial acquaintance, someone who knows every man, woman and child in the parish, without having to carry the burden of their souls. A sound drinking companion with good sense is what I need.”Bened, the local smith, is sharing some mead with a few others, and when Cadfael addresses them in Welsh, he is easily accepted. One of the young monks has taken a real liking to the work at the smithy and has made himself at home already.The quest for the saintly bones is the reason for the trip, but the ongoing friction in the community about which lovely girl is going to marry whom begins to take precedence in the book, to the point that Cadfael finds himself wanting to take sides. One young monk is clearly distracted, and when a major landholder, father of one of the girls, is found murdered, the story gets more interesting.Bened, the smith, seems to hold all of the religious party in equally high esteem, but Cadfael wishes him to know they are still just men.“‘In the Holy Land I've known Saracens I'd trust before the common run of the crusaders, men honourable, generous and courteous, who would have scorned to haggle and jostle for place and trade as some of our allies did. Meet every man as you find him, for we're all made the same under habit or robe or rags.’”I enjoyed the mystery. I had been advised that this is not the best book to start the series with, although it is the first, probably because it might put me off reading more. But forewarned is forearmed, so I was happy to read it quickly to get a taste.Knowing that the series improves and is so popular, I’m going to keep going (eventually). I’m told that the second book is a perfectly good place to start, if you’re considering it yourself. ",36,14
321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Willow ,233,97,4,"August 11, 2016","This book is actually quite good. I must admit though, I had a hard time getting through it. In fact, I pretty much had to sit myself down and force myself to read through to the end. I’ve decided that has much more to do with me than the book itself (consequently my high rating). The truth is, I just don’t like mysteries, and now I know that even by setting the mystery in a fascinating time period, this doesn’t change. When I was younger, I used to read every Agatha Christi ‘Poirot’ story I could get my hands on, and I think I burned myself out. Most of the time I just don’t care about ‘whodunit’. This leaves the magnetism of the detective to carry the story, which recently just hasn’t been enough.For people who love mysteries though, I think you will love this. Peters writes very well. She uses dialogue to bring her characters to life, and it’s great. I was surprised at how funny this book was. Cadfael is simply a GREAT character. Peters also captures the 1100s with insightful details into monasterial life. I think so many authors forget how powerful and important the church truly was during this time. This same attention to detail was used on the inner workings of a medieval Welsh village too. So many books just make out the villagers out to be ignorant clods, but Ellis is much more generous than that, giving everybody a more rounded feel. Everybody has a different agenda and a different motive, and Cadfael is able to work this out quite clearly and succinctly.Maybe someday I will be in the mood to read another Cadfael book, but I think I’m going to skip historical mysteries for a while. I do believe this is the crème de la crème of historical mysteries though. ",29,25

321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Charles  van Buren,"1,674",170,5,"August 12, 2021","Church politics and ambition lead to murderThis first in the Chronicles of Brother Cadfael sets the pace for the series. This one features the arrogant Prior Robert intent upon his own power and career rather than upon God; his toady Brother Jerome; Brother Columbanus who has timely seizures and visions; Brother Richard the kindly but fairly ineffectual sub-prior; Brother John who seems to be a man who should never have taken vows and Brother Cadfael spreading patience, humble wisdom and translations from Welsh overall. There you have a strange company traveling to remove the bones of a Welsh saint to the Abby of St. Peter and St. Paul in Shrewsbury, England against the opposition of the local Welsh community. Politics, both secular and ecclesiastical, murder, vanity, pride and ambition impede the expedition and lead to mystery.",28,N/A
321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Susan,"2,575",601,4,"August 27, 2019","This is the very first book in the Cadfael series; first published in 1977, and set in 1137, it still reads as though it could has been released this month. This is a timeless, classic mystery and an enjoyable introduction to the world of Cadfael and his fellow brothers at the Shrewsbury abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul.Brother Cadfael has arrived late to the cloister, after a full and eventful life. Now in his mid fifties, he has left the world behind him, embraced the monastic life and tends his Benedictine garden. However, as readers will know, he is always happy to become involved in interesting events and, when Prior Roberts wishes to travel to Wales and secure the relics of a local saint for the monastery, he manages to be taken along as interpreter - and gain a place for young Brother John, whose vows he feels were made for the wrong reason.Prior Robert is not a man who likes opposition and, along with his acolytes Brother Jerome and Brother Columbanus, he sets out determined to obtain the bones of Saint Winifred for the abbey. Local priest, Father Huw, is disconcerted when he hears of the mission and Rhisiart, a local landowner, opposes their desire to remove Winifred from Welsh soil. When Prior Robert attempts to use bribery to obtain what he wants, he finds he has misjudged the local people badly and, before long, Cadfael has a murder to solve. Cadfael is a charming character - a man who uses good sense, who does his best and who is never afraid of bending the rules if he is sure the outcome is worthwhile. If you are just embarking on this series then I am sure you will enjoy them – they are a delight to re-read.",27,1 comment
321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Wanda Pedersen,"1,807",348,4,"April 25, 2017","I am quite sure that I used to own a copy of this novel, back in the early 1980s. I finally donated it because I just couldn’t get into the story. Now, I look back at my younger self and shake my head, because this time around I found the story to be very accessible and very easy to engage. Another instance of the right book at the right time—not suitable for me in my 20s, but eminently suitable for me in my 50s.I think that Brother Cadfael will become an old friend—I will certainly be reading the next book of the series! In my opinion, Peters transplants the murder mystery genre into medieval times extremely well. She gives Brother Cadfael common sense and logic to work with, plus a good dose of human psychology. How he deals with the Church hierarchy and the other Brothers feels very real and is often amusing.The action begins slowly—the reader must be patient as Peters builds the story towards the murder, but after that, the action is unabated until the final resolution. This story is quite different from the forensic-based murder mysteries that crowd today’s shelves, but that very difference recommends it. Not exactly a cozy mystery, but a gentler one. No gore or psychopaths to deal with here.",25,4
321545,A Morbid Taste for Bones,Manybooks,"3,006",104,2,"June 30, 2019","Albeit that Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series is probably my favourite historical mystery series bar none, I also have to admit that I have NEVER really all that much either liked or even appreciated the first instalment of the series, that Peters' A Morbid Taste for Bones has always (and from day one so to speak) continually left me both cold and personally rather unsatisfied. And yes, when I first read A Morbid Taste for Bones in the early eighties (probably around 1983, when I was seventeen years of age), I actually almost decided NOT to continue with the series (which I thankfully did not do, as truly and in my opinion, ALL of the following Brother Cadfael series novels are at least in my humble opinion both vastly superior with regard to Ellis Peters' presented themes, her sense of time and place and also with regard to her general writing style and what she considers essential and necessary to describe and dissect in detail, and it certainly would have been a minor personal reading tragedy if I had not persevered and continued meeting with Brother Cadfael and reading about his sleuthing and exploits simply because I had found the first novel, I had found A Morbid Taste for Bones not all that readable and relatable). Now to and for me, my favourite parts of the Brother Cadfael series are and have always been how delightfully realistic and historically accurate Ellis Peters paints the 12th century A.D. British Civil War between King Stephen and the Empress Maud (also known as Mathilda) and how Deputy Sheriff of Shropshire Hugh Beringar slowly but surely becomes Brother Cadfael's best friend and close confidant (and someone upon whom Brother Cadfael can also generally rely to be fair when trying to solve potential crimes and misdeeds). And since A Morbid Taste for Bones does NOT have either the 12th century British Civil War scenario or Hugh Beringar present, I have indeed not ever really considered A Morbid Taste for Bones as all that enjoyable and pleasurable reading, finding the story rather tedious and personally dragging without in particular Hugh Beringar making even one appearance (and this especially since Ellis Peters renders the latter, renders Hugh as such a richly drawn and interesting character, so that one or rather so that I do totally and definitely miss and lament Hugh's non presence in A Morbid Taste for Bones). And indeed, and in fact, without Hugh Beringar, I for one even tend to personally consider Brother Cadfael as not really being in any manner complete as a character, and yes, that without the Civil War historical background, the Brother Cadfael mysteries would to and for me always be at best a bit mundane and one-sidedly tedious (and which A Morbid Taste for Bones certainly does in my opinion amply show). And this of course and naturally is also why A Morbid Taste for Bones is one of the only (the very few) Brother Cadfael novels I have never in any manner actively enjoyed and appreciated (and have in fact disliked to such and extent that for me on a personal and emotional level, I also do not really even consider A Morbid Taste for Bones as the true beginning of Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series, that I do approach and have always approached the second novel One Corpse too Many as the actual and real Brother Cadfael series beginning (with its 12th century King Stephen and Empress Maud civil war conflict and the advent and introduction of Hugh Beringar as Brother Cadfael's foil and soon to be best friend and partner when it comes to solving crimes).",21,N/A
