402013,Angus Thongs and FullFrontal Snogging,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,4,"December 26, 2020","Every time I reread these books, they turn out to be offensive in more and more ways. I can’t imagine this book getting Printz Honor now. And yet, this is pure comedy gold.__________Update 1/2/2017 Accidentally read it yet again. Not a bad beginning-of-the-year pick-me-up.__________There are times when I just HAVE to read something to perk me up, something light and silly and mindless. Louise Rennison's books always do the trick. It doesn't hurt either that this first book in Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series is a winner of Printz Honor, proving that even the silliest story about make-up, boys, and snogging can be written brilliantly. Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging never takes itself seriously or tries to teach some kind of moral lesson. Instead, its only aim is to provide tons of fun; and the book succeeds at it every time I read it. I do not think there is any point for me to sing this novel any more praise to convince you to give it a try, rather, I will list some quotes here for you to see if Louise Rennison's humor is your cup of tea.Wednesday, December 2nd.8:30 a.m.Dashing out of the house, Jas and I almost fell into Mark, waiting by the corner. Jas (big pal) said she had to run to her house first and she would see me at school. I went a bit red and walked on with him walking beside me. He said, ""Have you got a boyfriend?""I was speechless. What is the right answer to that question? I tell you what the right answer is... a lie, that's the right answer. So I said, ""I've just come out of a heavy thing and I'm giving myself a bit of space.""He looked at me. He really did have the biggest gob [mouth:] I have ever seen. ""So is that no?""And I just stood there and then this really weird thing happened... he touched my breast!!! I don't mean he ripped my blouse off, he just rested his hand on the front of my breast. Just for a second, before he turned and went off to school.12:30 p.m.What does it mean when a boy rests his hand on your breast? Does it mean he has a megahorn? Or was his hand just tired? 4:30 p.m.Why am I even thinking about this? No sign of Mark (the breast molester) when I got home, thank goodness.4:45 p.m.Still, you would think if a boy rests his hand on your breast he might bother to see you sometime.* * *Sunday, February 7th11:00 a.m.Got dressed in short skirt, then me and Jas walked up and down to the main road. We wanted to see how many cars with boys in them hooted at us. Ten!! (We had to walk up and down for four hours... still, ten is ten!!!)",117,12
402013,Angus Thongs and FullFrontal Snogging,♛ may,801,3765,1,"December 3, 2016","So most girls, I assume, would have read this back in middle school, but *dramatically flips hair* I’m not like most girls.^That was lame, I apologize. Basically, the only reason I read this book is because my lovely coffee-soddened friend, Pragya, who is probably trying to get back at me for some horrible thing I did but am unaware of, convinced me to. :) :)This book is so terrible and I feel like I probably shouldn’t be rating it, since it’s not targeted towards me, but,  it’s just so  bad.  The main character is the most annoying character I’ve ever read. The only thing she talks about it:1.	Her nose2.	Boys3.	How her friends are losers4.	Her nose5.	And how her life sucks so much, she wants to dieI’ve never seen a fourteen-year old act like this, this is a terrible representation of teenagers, y’all should be  ashamed! And the humour felt so  forced.  It wasn’t even funny.  How do people like this book???!!! And WHY is there 10 books in the series???!! TEN BOOKS???!!!So . . . I’m sorry if you’re offended, or if this book was your early teenage happiness but the only reason I wrote such a terrible review was for the crazy coffee lover I mentioned earlier. So there, I hope you’re happy, you’ve made me do a terrible thing.  “I suppose this is what life will be like for me—never having a boyfriend, always just living through others” 1 star!!",100,75
402013,Angus Thongs and FullFrontal Snogging,Kelly (and the Book Boar),"2,393",7250,4,"September 27, 2016","Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Meet Georgia. She’s basically a 14-year old version of this . . . . 
  
I’m sure plenty of other reviews have and will point out that . . . . 
  
But you know what? I still am was an asshole much like Georgia back in the day. Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging is a year in the life of Georgia courtesy of her journal and was most definitely just what the doctor ordered for me to read on Presidential Debate Day. I never expected to laugh out loud reading the trials and tribulations of this teenie bopper, but I sure as shart did. Especially the part about her first tweezing experience . . . . 
  
Her quest for love with an unattainable crush . . . . 
  
And trying to get some uhhhhhhhh experience (if ya know what I’m sayin’) . . . . 
  “I lay on my arm until it went numb and then I lifted it (with the nonnumb arm) onto my breasts. I wanted to see what it felt like to have a strange hand on them. It was quite nice, but what do I know?”

  
Not to mention all of the bits with Angus . . . . 
  
This isn’t a book that will change the world or make you smarter or want to be a better person, but hell . . . 
  
And sometimes I just want to laugh. If you’re interested in the same, then you too might find Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging to be . . . .

Oh, Georgia, you say the most ridiculous shit, and I love you more for being such a drama llama every time. She's a complete loon of a 14-year-old in every possible way. I laughed out loud every few pages. I can't wait to get to the books that I haven't read at the end of the series!",46,N/A

402013,Angus Thongs and FullFrontal Snogging,Megan,39,8,5,"June 28, 2007","Hillariosity! This is another book, from the brits, that people either love or hate. I happen to love this series, and laughed so hard I actually cried. I think people who hate this book are turned off by the main character Georgia. She is vain, self centered, hormonal, ridiculous and, I think, absolutely fabulous. This is the first of a series and we are introduced to her mad little sister libby, her feral cat Angus, her Mum and Dad, and group of silly girlfriends. It's written as a diary and a lot of people like to compare it to Bridget Jones. I have never read Bridget Jones so I can't really comment on that. I can however say that I took this book with me on a trip and illicited many curious glances from strangers in the airport. They may have thought I was having a seizure, but in fact I as laughing my bum off. ",37,7

402013,Angus Thongs and FullFrontal Snogging,Becky,"1,309",1595,2,"May 21, 2015","*Sigh* I wanted fluff, not brain-damage. Based on the recommendation from several friends who loved this, I picked this up when I saw it at a library sale, and I figured that now was a good time to read it since I'd just read a duo of emotionally traumatizing books and needed something light and fun after that. But this, aside from having a few funny moments, was mostly a 14 year old selfish angst-fest. If I was that annoying as a 14 year old, I think I may have to nominate my parents for sainthood for not murdering me. I got so bored with it by the middle that I ended up skimming most of the second half. Drama, boys, makeup, snotty fucking ""sense of humor"" and cattiness. Thank god I'm not a teenager anymore. I wasn't a fan of the style of this book either. It was written in journal format, but as is often the case, it ends up being mostly 1st person. But being that Miss Georgia is a drama queen, I can forgive that. She'd want to pour her heart out. But damn it was choppy and random and the timestamps didn't make sense. I think a lot of them were supposed to be funny, like ""Oh, I'm going to do this thing and it's going to make me look like a fashion model and then the Sex God will love me!"" and then 2 minutes later, ""My life is ruined!"" Ha ha ha. See how funny that was? Yeah. Me neither. 2 stars. ",26,8

It was hysterical!The writing was quite good and the protagonist was interesting. She was the typical epitome of most teenage girls on the cusp between childhood and adulthood. I felt it dragged on a bit toward the end. Over all though, it was funny, interesting and most of all, enjoyable.Big thanks to Tatiana for recommending it to me!",25,8

It's OK, I'm Wearing Really Big Knickers ★★★★3.) Knocked Out by my Nunga-Nungas ★★★-----------------------------------------------BOOK #22 READ FOR BELIEVATHON ROUND 2.I reread this book for my rereading childhood favourites  video![trigger warnings are listed at the bottom of this review and may contain spoilers]★★★★.5I feel like such a hypocrite giving this such a high rating after DNFing Dear Dumb Diary when this is even more problematic than that, but I suppose we all have our problematic faves! I loved this so much. SO many laugh-out-loud moments and the characters all seemed so real and I LOVE ANGUS THE CAT MORE THAN LIFE ITSELF. Will definitely be continuing on with the series as I think I've only ever read the first 2 or 3 previously! Now it's time to go and re-watch the ICONIC movie adaptation xDtrigger warnings: very outdated and problematic sense of humour, homophobic comments, sexist jokes, slut shaming, fatphobia, joking about mental illnesses, suicide and self-harm, mention of a 29 year old guy kissing a 13 year old girl (EW) and a 14 year old dating a 30 year old (DOUBLE EW), joking about paedophilia, incest???? Her gross cousin tries to kiss her (TRIPLE EW) and a gross incest joke about HER DAD (help), questionable comment about wheelchair users… you get the point. I'm only 90 pages in so I'm sure there'll be more but this is already too long…just… be warned. ",20,N/A
402013,Angus Thongs and FullFrontal Snogging,Sara,179,119,5,"August 16, 2008","I got to the point where I couldn't read this book during silent reading time in my class, it made me laugh so hard. I'm not an easy touch for this type of humor - slapstick and outrageous. ATFFS, however, made me laugh so hard, I snorted. The epistolary nature of the narrative adds so much to the plot. A snippet about a girl who accidentally-on-purpose shaves off her eyebrows is cringingly amusing, but when it's told in five or six installments, each a few minutes apart, and that snippet weaves itself through the rest of the narrative in little comments like, ""No news on the eyebrow front,"" there's no way to avoid laughing until your stomach aches. The fact of the matter is that Georgia is a tragic hero. You couldn't laugh so much if there wasn't something inherently tragic about her inability to enjoy life and admit it. She throws herself into frays in which it is obvious that she will be destroyed, and we cheer her on because she keeps trying. Georgia is who we want to be, because she succeeds through ridiculous perseverance. Read it and laugh, because weeping isn't far behind.",20,N/A

I am bursting with womanhood, I wear a bra! It's a bit on the loose side and does ride up round my neck if I run for the bus ... but the womanly potential is here, you bald coot.""Good stuff. Huh, I don't think I've ever worn a training bra. I must be an embarrassment to the sort.10:36 am3. I have a three-year-old sister who may have peed somewhere in my room. I miss my sister. She was supposed to come home today but apparently it's Sunday. Stupid independence shit.10:37 am5. I am very ugly and need to go into an ugly home. I am packing my bag right now. My sister - who still isn't here - would wholeheartedly agree with that statement. I wish she'd come home today so she would actually say it to my face. It's complicated. I miss her.10:43 amHahahahahahahahaha.10:57 amUgh, I'm so tired. Douchey McDouche needs to stop texting me. I don't have the energy for this. He should just get back with his girlfriend and leave me out of it.11:09 amOh, wait. I did wear training bras. Eh. Probably still an embarrassment to the sort.3:03 pmShit. Fell asleep with my glasses still on. Where was I? Oh yeah, shaving the eye brows with Dad's razor. Oy.3:03 pmDon't do it, Georgia. STAHP.3:04 pmGirl, you should have listened. Now step away from the eyebrow pencils.3:05 pmAnd from those friends of yours. 3:24 pmFuck no. Incest. Not again. Aaargh, I don't want all these books to inform me about disturbing sibling and cousinly relationships. I no longer miss my sister. Well, at least, Georgia seems to agree with me.3:28 pmThat reminds me of the time I was biking to school and my saddle flew off. I had to do the rest of the way cycle racer style because I was already way too late. I did manage to not get a tardy because, yeah, my saddle obviously wasn't there anymore. Apparently, my French teacher had gone through something similar a few weeks before. Huh. Whadda you know. 3:32 pmBack pain. I wish Elend were real. He'd read for me. He'd find the inner workings of the female teenage mind fascinating. Ugh, he's perfect. I want him to hug me. And more.3:54 pmI'm not answering that text, no matter how many smileys you send with it. I should stop listening to beautiful but depressing Dutch music. This is not good for me.3:55 pmWhat's with the Satanic rituals in here? I'm never switching to contacts, by the way. Own the nerdiness. O-O3:57 pmOMG, GEORGIA TALKS IN ALL CAPS TOO.4:02 pmI was such a wuss in secondary school. 4:03 pmStill am.4:23 pmFood break.5:16 pmI can't believe they cancelled Bunheads. Ugh. Losers.5:17 pmHahahahahahahaha.5:19 pmI don't like the word ""snogging"". The Dutch words are worse though. Sleuren, bekken, tongen, Erlack erlack. Argh, I have no idea what TTFN means. I wonder if it's dirty. She did say it to piss off her father. Oh, got it. Ta ta for now. Hm, I guess it can come across as giving attitude. 5:21 pmMust. Not.

This is just getting ridiculous.8:26 pmI don't think we mean the same thing when we say someone is wet. Mental horrible images of ""wet"" Lindsay. Must. Stop.
