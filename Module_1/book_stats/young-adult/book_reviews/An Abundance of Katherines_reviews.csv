49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Megs ♥,160,1274,2,"December 4, 2013","This was by far the worst experience I've ever had reading a John Green book. I really always enjoy his writing and humor, but this one just didn't do anything for me.I don't think the book was horrible, but it couldn't hold my attention too long so I was happy it was very short. If it was any longer I probably wouldn't have finished it. I couldn't stand Colin. He was annoying and whiny and just because he acknowledges that fact himself doesn't mean it makes it any less annoying to read about. His friend Hassan was alright. I didn't mind him and I thought he had some funny parts, but most of the humor with him was about his fatness and man boobs. That's not exactly my kind of humor, but I'm sure there are other people who love that kinda stuff. Lindsey wasn't that interesting either. She wasn't annoying like Colin, but I just found myself thinking they would hook up and that's it.To me this book was just bland. It didn't have any good twists or an engaging plot. Usually I feel lots of emotions when reading one of John's books, but with this one I felt nothing but boredom. He does include his signature road trip where the character learns some lessons about life, but getting that far was a struggle for me.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who wants to try John Green, because I rate this so much lower than all of his other books. The writing style and formula is present, but it's just not as good.",785,70

  2 DISAPPOINTING STARS!
You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!You don't know what expectations I had about this book.I have read other John Green's book like Looking for Alaska and The Fault in our Stars and really liked them especially the first one,also the hype about this book is insane so I thought why not.Guess I thought wrong.This book sure contains the marvel of John Green's smart writing,and it is so realatable,especially if you are a nerdy teen with tumblr,and that's smart and unique in a way,and I gave this book 2 stars just because of that.In the other hand it is boring,like ultimately boring.First I thought the idea with dating only girls named Katherine would be interesting or fun,but it turned out to be so dull and I really thought of not finishing this book.The only part of the book I did like was the ending and the famous John Green tumblr-ish positive message and to be honest was good.I really wanted to like this book.____________________________________________

49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Natalie Monroe,587,3478,2,"January 25, 2015","A reenactment of the moment An Abundance of Katherines was conceived:John Green sat at his desk, quietly contemplating the ghettoization of scrambled eggs as a breakfast food and brainstorming ideas for his new book. His last novel, Looking for Alaska, had done moderately well, but he wanted to do something different this time. Something to show his critics that he wasn't a one-trick pony yet out-of-there enough to show his nerdfighters that he was one of them. An outsider, a man of the people.His eyes drifted to a map taped on the wall, then to an unfinished Scrabble game from last night. His brother Hank had been kicking his butt, but had to leave to mediate on the metaphysics of ice-cream trucks before he could finish spelling 'hamartia' (luckily). As he was idly staring at his unused letters, it hit him. ""Eureka!"" he yelled, glasses sliding down his nose in his excitement. ""That's it! I'll write a book about anagrams! That's nerdy and chic, and in no way like my last protagonist's obsession with famous last words.""John picked up the letters, rearranging them in his head: 'Hem, arrow, hero. Yes, hero! He needed a protagonist. Preferably one like himself. White male, middle-class range, intelligent, quirky... but as an extra twist, his quirkiness would be the result of autism. Mild autism. Nothing too heavy. Fans won't be able to relate to him! Also, research is hard. I'd rather philosophize on Venn diagrams of octopi and dogs.'Putting the letters down, he paced the floor, dialogue and plot points bombarding his head like unformed constellations. 'My protagonist should have a best friend like Colonel. Quirky enough to get his jokes, but won't overshadow the main character, which is in no way like me. Let's make him an Arab, too. That takes care of the diversity problem. And a love interest! Gorgeous and quirky. Oh, and she should exist to teach my main character an important lesson. Yay, feminism points! But how do I get them to meet?""His gaze landed on the map again. 'A road trip! That's not like Pudge and Colonel's emotional journey to find Alaska at all!'John laughed, clapped his hands together and sat down in front of his laptop. Then he began to write.'John, my man, I don't know how you think of this stuff.'",290,55
49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Simcsa,92,87,1,"November 15, 2011","I tried. I really did, believe me! But I can't do it, it's boring, it has no plot whatsoever and I don't like any of the characters. I'm not going to torture myself..",257,13
49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Erin,131,56,1,"December 8, 2013","Had I been reading this on paper instead of my computer, it probably would have gone into the fireplace here: ""She was incredibly hot--in that popular-girl-with-bleached-teeth-and-anorexia kind of way, which was Colin's least favorite way of being hot."" And if somehow it had survived that initial immolation, I definitely would have shredded it for birdcage fodder (and I don't even own a bird!) here: ""She looked prettier than she ever had before--Colin always preferred girls without makeup.""This book was everything I don't like about John Green. And I've already spent enough of my one precious life complaining about how his books are the literary embodiment of high school boys being unsuccessful in love and the general social hierarchy and then constructing an impossibly unpleasant wall of moral superiority as some sort of retroactive explanation for why no one likes them (they're all stupid and superficial anyway and I'm ABOVE all of that) when really maybe they're just obnoxious or plain unlucky and they can't seem to realize that - etc etc to want to spend much more time on it. Basically this is the platonic ideal of John Green books. His books teach bad lessons to fragile kids and turn them into insufferable judgmental douchebags.So Colin, maybe all those Katherines dumped you because you're kind of an asshole. Where's the variable for that?",211,9
49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Kim,286,769,4,"October 30, 2010","Colin Singleton is not a vampire or a werewolf or a sorcerer or a punning Austin zombie. He doesn’t live in a dystopian society, he hasn’t slept with his teacher. He doesn’t do drugs, his parents aren’t divorced, and he’s suffered no traumas unless you count being dumped by a slew (okay, nineteen) of girls named Katherine. So, why am I reading this? I have been programmed to only care about supernatural cute boys. I call this my mid life crisis. If I give in and self analyze, I would say that I’m avoiding real life. I’m letting myself get caught up in situations that I would have daydreamed about at maybe age 12. Being the ‘damsel in distress’, being unconditionally loved for qualities that I have not yet discovered in myself. Feeling safe, always protected by really cute guys… the bad guys always get caught, and everyone lives happily ever after. What I’m  avoiding is that memory of that… drive… that happens somewhere around age 16... Where you feel like you have the ability to change the world. That you will go off and do amazing things and that your whole life is waiting for you. It’s a rush. I remember sitting in the Boston Commons on summer night in 1988, I was 17, freshly graduated waiting to start college… we had just moved into an apartment in East Boston and Jimmy Cliff was playing a concert in the park. I didn’t have to tell anyone where I was going or when I would be back. I remember sitting on this hill, staring at the sky through the trees, listening to that reggae beat and thinking ‘I am free. I am young and I can do anything.’THAT is what I’m running from. So, when I finished  AAOK, I almost resented Green for reminding me of that. Then, I had this selfless epiphany. This is not for me. This was written for that generation. Those kids that are getting ready to change the world. They want to ‘matter’, they want to be remembered. I really envy them. Not in that self piteous way… just in that youthful energetic way. I get this way each fall when I watch the kids slumping off to UVM. They look so hopeful and serious. Why does that have to fade? This is a road trip book. I’ve seen it listed as such. I would expand on that ‘road trip’ theme and make it not just a literal one. Colin wants to get away from being the dumpee of all girls named Katherine. But, it’s than that. Colin has always been considered a ‘child prodigy’ and he’s thinking that maybe that isn’t enough to ‘matter’ or to make a mark on the world. After all, a prodigy isn’t a genius… A prodigy regurgitates. A genius creates. Colin’s road trip is much more mental than led on. I like that Colin doesn’t sparkle or have telling scars. I picture him as a cooler Napoleon Dynamite. He has a sidekick. A pudgy Horatio. He has a talent for anagramming. And he likes math. Okay, I was all for it except for the math part. Ugh. I admit, I skimmed a lot of the theorems and graphs and algebraic equations. Lost me there. But, anagramming… swoon I am an anagramming nerd.  (Regard naming man, Drain Merman Gang, Ragged Man Arm Inn)Colin and his Horatio, Hassan, end up leaving Chicago and turning up in Gutshot, Tennessee. THAT is a horror story --‘dead end’ turn-- of events. I went all Ned Beatty and shuddered and almost stopped reading. But, I’m learning to fight my biases… it’s one of those mid life crisis goals. The south is NOT scary… not always. (Gutshot? Really? That was hard to swallow, I’m sure there are towns named that and all, but I’m taking baby steps here) Colin has many Eureka moments in Gutshot and each one makes me love him more. He’s a sweet kid who just wants to be loved, to not be left behind. Who can fault that? Colin quotes Democritus “Everywhere man blames nature and fate, yet his fate is mostly but the echo of his character and passions, his mistakes and weaknesses.”What a great quote to pass on to Generation Z or whatever they are now. I wish that I had that when I was young. I might not have set myself up for failure… I hope that these kids carry this with them because I feel a kinship with them. I was a Reagan kid, they are Bush 34 kids… we know…This book really does give hope if not understanding the need for hope. (if that makes sense) I hear that there is a movie in the works. I’m sure they’ll pretty up Colin and make him seem quirky and all that, but I hope that they delve into that next level and give props to that insecurity, because that’s what we need. To see that it’s okay if you only matter to yourself. Ned Vizzini’s It's Kind of a Funny Story had that same sort of message and I am saddened that that movie didn’t do well, that teens care more about zombies or jackasses.  My next Eureka moment: to pass this lesson on to my kids.Post Script: Oh, and I want to mention that there are footnotes in this book. And it’s okay. It’s more like the DFW type footnotes where you feel like you have an extra character that you can turn to and say ‘I know, right?’… It’s all good. ",175,29
49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Emma,"2,801",349,4,"March 2, 2018","Picture this: You used to be a childhood prodigy. Member of an academic game team. You excelled in school. You were special. You met a girl named Katherine and the two of you started dating.Then she dumps you.Then eighteen more girls named Katherine dump you.Suddenly, you're a teenager with no claim to fame except for your former status as a prodigy. No new ideas. No girl. No plans for the summer excepting wasting away in your room and moping.This is not your life. But it is Colin Singleton's life immediately after his graduation from high school.Given Colin's history with girls, you might not be surprised that John Green chose to name his second novel An Abundance of Katherines. After sulking for several days after being dumped (again), Colin is dragged out of his room by Hasan, his best friend. Hassan is confident that the only cure for Colin's depression is a road trip. So Colin and his Judge-Judy-loving, overweight, Muslim pal head off for the great beyond that is the United States between the coasts. Their road trip stops in Gutshot, Tennessee. But the adventures don't. Hired by a local bigwig to compile an oral history of Gutshot, Colin and Hassan find themselves staying with Hollis and her daughter, Lindsey. It is in Gutshot that Colin finally has what he has always wanted, a truly original idea. Thus, Colin begins to create a theorem of love in his attempt to understand his own rocky love life.Most of my friends who have read this book and Green's first novel Looking for Alaska agree that his second novel is not as compelling a read. Having only read ""Katherines,"" I cannot make a judgment one way or the other. What I can say is that I loved the style of this book. There has been a growing trend to use footnotes in novels--notable examples include The Bartimaeus Trilogy by Johnathan Stroud, Jasper Fforde's Thursday Next novels, and Ibid A Life by Mark Dunn which is a novel written entirely of endnotes. Green continues that tradition here to good effect.The tone throughout is quirky, nerdy, and generally fun. I don't know that reading this novel will change any lives, but it will certainly get a lot of laughs. The best parts are, undoubtedly, the dialogues between Hassan and Colin. The guys are just so likable! In addition, Green's writing is snappy--all the better to keep the laughs coming. Like Nothing but the Truth by Justina Chen Headley, this book includes a bit of math. The ""real"" math behind Colin's theorem appears in the back of the book in an appendix and Green even has a website where you can use the theorem for your own relationships (if it doesn't crash your computer). Despite all of that, Green is a self-proclaimed lost cause when it comes to math. (The theorem was drafted by friend (and ""resident mathematician"" for Brotherhood 2.0), Daniel Biss.) I wanted to share this for a couple of reasons. First, because I think it's great that Green is writing outside of what some might call his ""comfort zone"" and, second, because it should illustrate that you don't have to like math to enjoy a book that features a lot of math.Anyway, if you need a cheerful book with some fun, lovable characters I don't think you can do better than this book which was recently nominated for the LA Times Book Award in addition to being selected as a Printz Award honor book (Looking for Alaska won the actual Printz Award, just to put that into perspective).You can find this review and more on my blog Miss Print",159,14
49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Anna,936,106,2,"April 19, 2008","I was not terribly impressed with Katherines. I read Green's Looking For Alaska and thought it was one of the best young adult novels I have ever read SO I was expecting this book to measure up to a higher standard. Unfortunately, it did not even come close. Here's my beef with the book:1) The characters. I had a really hard time getting into Katherines because the characters were not too likable. Green gave the characters personalities, but he missed something in the character development category that could have made his characters people that readers (especially young adults) could relate to. 2) The basic premise of the book did not appeal to me. I never bought into the 19-girlfriends-named-Katherine bit and struggled to understand why the main character spent the entire novel trying to devise a mathematical formula that would explain why he was dumped so often by his girlfriends. It all just seemed a bit OCD and irrational to me, and it almost felt like he was trying too hard to come up with a unique idea for his sophomore novel.3) I was disappointed because I found huge chunks of the book to be pretty boring.  Many of the conversations were dull and I found myself skimming a lot of the text. I skimmed because I kept thinking the book would make a turnaround but I think most young adult readers would probably give up. I think the footnotes and references made it worse but it just seemed to me like a lot of what happened could have been said in a simpler and faster way.My last concern is that I am not sure who this text is really for. Middle school kids probably would not ""get"" the main message because of the higher level vocabulary and I think those obscure references/footnotes make the book seem even more difficult than it is. I wish this book was more like Looking For Alaska because that was truly a fantastic read but hopefully his future writing will sort of return to that simple but beautiful type of expression. Katherines isn't horrible but I definitely would not go out of my way to recommend it and would suggest that you read Looking For Alaska instead.",112,14

49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Scarlet,187,1146,2,"March 10, 2013","2.5Here are some things I’ve realized after reading AAoK:1. John Green is a talented, clever writer with a great sense of humor.2. Contrary to what I’d like to think, I’m still math-phobic.3. I’ll never, ever date a has-been child prodigy. Or a washed-up genius. Or a whiny guy who speaks 11 languages. Or whatever it is that Colin’s supposed to be.An Abundance of Katherines is a hilarious book but it did not make me laugh. Okay, maybe a little but that was more like snorting-in-mild-amusement than full-fledged laughing. I found the humor a little tiresome. But then, I’m the kind of girl who cracks up at things that normal people don’t find even remotely funny so maybe there’s something wrong with me and not the book.AAoK has a nerdy, heartbroken hero (irritating), some cussing in Arabic (gets taxing after a while), jokes about man-boobs and fractured balls (not really my idea of humor), a lot of math (scary) that strangely looks interesting (I wouldn’t know for sure since I skipped those parts).Colin really got on my nerves. Whining and theorem-making are not exactly things I’m fond of, and that’s all Colin does (in addition to spewing out random facts). I wish the narration was in first-person; it would have made things more interesting.The footnotes were a relief. I loved them – even the ones that had math. In fact, they were my sole motivation for trudging through the pages.This was my first John Green novel and well... I’m not terribly impressed. I hope TFioS and Looking for Alaska fare better.I’ll leave you with one of those rare lines that actually made me laugh:
  “He tried not to sob much, because the plain fact of the matter is that boy-sobbing is exceedingly unattractive. Lindsey said, “Let it out, let it out,” and then Colin said, “But I can’t, because if I let it out it’ll sound like a bullfrog’s mating call.” ”

49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Darth J ,417,1244,4,"April 15, 2015","So this was my first John Green book. I get his appeal in that he can create characters that, although very different from us, can somehow resonate with our emotions and experiences. I ordered this book used on Amazon, and as luck would have it before when I got an autographed Rainbow Rowell book, I somehow was fortunate enough to score a first edition of this one:Apparently, a first edition of one of his early books is a big deal, or so I’m told...On to the story: we have a prodigy who has just graduated high school, was dumped, and makes his way on a road trip accompanied by his best friend. Our MC, Colin is struggling with two things: understanding his recent breakup and wanting to matter in the world. Being a prodigy (not a genius!) he believes that he can create a formula that will be able to predict how long any given relationship will last by inputting certain factors. It’s this single-minded focus that blinds and consumes him. He becomes frustrated when all but one of his relationships fit into the formula.Until he discovers that his recollection of that one relationship was all wrong. Soon he starts to realize that maybe he had been looking at all of them in that same way.What resonated most with me about this story wasn’t the fact that Colin bemoaned his previous romances, but the fact that he wanted to matter; he wanted to contribute something to this world. He was a child prodigy and he plateaued and was now faced with living a mundane adulthood. I just wanted to say, “Bruh, I feel you on that. You have no idea.” And I think a lot of people who were once bright children, full of promise and possibility, will relate to Colin’s existential dilemma and the anxiety that comes with facing an ordinary life after an extraordinary childhood. Here we have a character about to enter college, on the precipice of entering the real world, knowing that the good years are behind him; he peaked too soon and now everything is a slow downhill crawl towards death. But there’s hope in Colin’s story. He breaks the cycle of only dating Katherines and hooks up with the hot chick like the end of a John Hughes film. Maybe the future isn’t so bleak for him after all.",90,42
49750,An Abundance of Katherines,Andi Mac ❀,230,110,2,"February 1, 2021","Yup. I'm still not a John Green fan.One thing I have noticed about the characters John Green creates in his novels: they're too quirky, they're smart (this one in particular has an overly smart character) and they talk in quips. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE. At least not all the time. I think this is John's way of incorporating himself into his books. Most YA readers see John Green as the best author ever, but his books are not that unique and his characters are the same with a few minor tweaks. I just don't get the hype.However, there were some memorable parts of this book that makes it unique: Tangents and footnotes. I thought that was a very clever addition that screamed Colin. I did NOT like the repetitiveness of the word fug and the name Katherine. I now hate that name thanks to this book. Overall, this book was just sooo hard to get into... I had to force myself to keep reading hoping it will get better. Instead, this just wasted my time. I could have been reading a book more enjoyable than this one during my break. Sighhhh. I guess I expected so much but got a mediocre, predictable read from an author who is labelled as one of the best in YA.",83,N/A

I read An Abundance of Katherines before I even knew who John Green was. Remember - I’m 1,000, so cut me some slack people! Over the past several years it has come to my attention that almost everyone else considers this to be the lesser of all of the Green works, which had me questioning my mental state (or whether or not I was intoxicated) the first time I read this book.Okay, so I’ll grant you the premise is kinda snooze-a-rific. I mean, a former child prodigy who has been dumped by 19 chicks named Katherine who wants to develop something like this . . . 
  
(*hooooooark* Ugh – just looking at that math gives me dry heaves)in order to be able to predict who will be the dumper (or dumpee) in any relationship and when said relationship will end is not the most exciting story to be told.And maybe Colin was a sitzpinkling anagramming weirdo who moped around feeling miserable about getting dumped by the umpteenth Katherine in his life, but without him I would have never had a chance to meet Hassan. Oh Hassan! I’m pretty sure he’ll go down in history as one of my favorite supporting pals. He completely stole the show. If you’ve not yet read Katherines, think of Hassan as younger, less dickholey, and more Muslim version of Trent from Swingers . . . 
  
Hassan is a riot, he can woo the ladies without even trying, and he refers to himself occasionally as “Daddy.” He’s the only person who was able to stop Colin from “lying facedown on the carpet” . . . 
  
and was the driving force in this story behind my most favorite of all plotlines . . . 
  
Man I love road trips! If I were to be 100% honest, Katherines might not be deserving of all 5 Stars this second time around. . . but I’m not changing the rating. I love this book unapologetically and it’s still my favorite John Green – even if I’m the only one who feels that way. If nothing else, this book gave the world the following quote:
  “Books are the ultimate Dumpees: put them down and they’ll wait for you forever; pay attention to them and they always love you back.”
 And that may be good enough for a ½ Star bump on its own.Maybe Colin wasn’t a “relatable teenager” (whatever the F that means), but at least he admitted that Holden Caulfield was a self-absorbed loser. My generation grew up with a different John who wrote characters like these . . . 
  
John Green is this generation’s John Hughes and everyone should taste a bit of his Kool-Aid. 
  
You know the old saying: “Once you go Green, you never go back” . . . or something like that.Oh and one more thing. I am freaking STARVING for a Monster Thickburger after reading this book. F you, Hassan!

  Lovely romantic novel!

  THE IMPORTANCE OF NINETEEN
This is a truly entertaining tale of Colin Singleton, a 17-years old boy, with an IQ over 200 but he's not the kind of genius like to get into college at 6 years old (at least, it was advised to his parents not to push him to do it) and having a kinda normal youth, where his only friend is Hassan Harbish, who is truly important to Colin, since Hassan is his only anchor to try to understand how the world works and how the rest of people really is doing,......however......in the matter of romance, Colin has doing pretty good on his own, since he has 19 Katherines as girlfriends so far, since he's convinced that an intrisic requirement to consider a girl as a potential girlfriend is being named ""Katherine"" (precisely in that way, not any kind of variation or different spelling)......and the 19th Katherine (or in his own words ""Katherine XIX"") breaks up with him and Colin is not sure why, while he is already comfortable with the unavoidable fact that sooner or later, he will break up with a Katherine (he even has a math theorem for that)......so, he needs to make a road trip (along with his good friend Hassan) after the last Katherine (XIX) and ask her face-to-face why they really break up......however......the reason of World War I (yes, I know that now sounds weird, but you'll get it once read it) will cause an unpredictable detour and stop in their journey......making Colin and even Hassan that life offers them more than they could imagine and they can't force fate or manipulated or even fit it in a math formula......but recognize it once it's in front of them.",70,3
