13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Natalie,446,10,5,"June 10, 2008","In retrospect, this is not a perfect novel, or series of novels, but when I think of who I wanted to be when I was ten years old, my answer was always Alanna. (And I still have a crush on George.)",223,8
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Kat Kennedy,475,1600,4,"July 8, 2010","After reading three paranormal/urban fantasy romances in a row, you can only imagine how happy I was to read, not only something different, but something GOOD!Good is the best description I can give of Alanna. I wouldn't say it was great. It gets pretty close to it, though. Some parts of it seem unrealistic to me. Alanna being so readily accepted by the boys etc. But the story is short, fun, action-packed with magic and mystery and high-adventure.Alanna it a great character. Stubborn, cheeky, doubtful of herself. The supporting characters, ranging from Prince Jonathan, Sir Myles and King George are all great. Gary, Raoul and Alex are never fully realized but that's only to be expected with such a short book.It is the rather typical girl-in-boy's clothing story but the writing is rather good and the sense of fun more than makes up for some of the predictability. The end isn't quite the blazing glory that I'd hope for but it wasn't too bad and there's many more books to follow so I can't wait.Over all a thoroughly enjoyable read and I can't wait to devour the sequels!Edited to Add:I just had to mention something, possibly the one thing that really annoyed me! There's this evil character in the book, The king's nephew. He's clearly evil and it's made very obvious to the reader, but despite all of the evidence, the Prince refuses to believe that this person could possibly betray him.Say what? This isn't the first time I've read something like this in a book and I have to wonder if the author ever imagined what it would be like growing up in court - a system usually known for its lies and betrayal and petty squabbling over power.Now, I'm sorry, but if I were Queen of the world (think about it - it really wouldn't be such a bad idea. I'm not asking you to vote or anything - just to ponder the possibility) then I'd kind of be cautious if I'd almost died twice and the only person that could possibly have tried to kill me twice was the first person to inherit the throne upon my death. I'd at least take a moment to think about it.And why trust anyone implicitly? If I were Queen of the World (don't you think that title just SUITS me?) then I'd have categories of people:Those absolutely trusted without question.Those I trust mostly but keep an eye on.Those I'm friendly with but am wary of.Those I don't trust (people in this category would either be about to die or already dead.)The titles of Those Absolutely Trusted Without Question will be awarded posthumously after they've completed an act to save my life - losing theirs in the process. I just find this kind of trusting royal a ridiculous characterization. If you have a significant ruling power, say a kingdom, then despite receiving it by right of birth/might/money, someone is going to try and take it from you. They may be smarter, better looking and more capable then you but it's still your job to ensure they never wrest power from your cold, dead fingers. To do that, you kind of have to use a little more brain power and a little less blind loyalty!*Breaths a sigh of relief* And I promised myself I'd have a break from ranting! Oh well, maybe the next review will be rant free!",152,29
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Wendy Darling,"1,520",33800,3,"August 13, 2016","3.5 starsFinally read this (*gasp*!) for our classics discussion Friday, 11/27! Our special guest will be the wonderful author Andrea K. Höst, and I'll post a link when it's live.I enjoyed this very much, but it felt like a first book, with rough transitions and rather unnuanced characterization. But I do like Alanna (and I love George!), so I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.",104,26
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Tamara,684,201,2,"February 25, 2016","Hey, at least I tried.Shorted version of the full review (The full one felt like an academic paper on why I dont like this book and series so I had to cut some parts. Oh, how easy it is talking about books I dont like. Also fun! ^_^ Be warned, this review contains my thoughts for this book and some minor/big spoilers for rest of the series -I’ve done some reading and research- which are tagged as spoilers and hidden from virgin eyes.)For myself, and I suspect many people, books we read and love as children acquire blind spots of handwavium from sheer sentiment unless we reread them as adults with a critical, rather than nostalgic, mindset. I’m an adult reading this and I’m not ashamed at reading this and I’m gonna poke fun at it. You like this book? Fine. I’m totally ok with that. So please be ok with me (kinda) poking fun at this one as well. And dont you dare tell me it gets better. Dont you dare. I’m warning you :D
  TEN REASONS WHY I DONT LIKE THIS BOOK/SERIES:
 Reason 1: For those who don’t know, the series is about a girl named Alanna who wants to be a knight, so she disguises herself as a boy and switches places with her twin brother. Thus he gets sent to learn how to be a wizard (God, Alanna, why don’t you want to be a wizard?!) and she goes off to learn knightly stuff (BO-RING…Kidding..Kinda. That’s Harry Potter lover in me talking, sorry.) Based on that, I expected the book to be about three things:1. Binding her boobs (done)2. Hiding her period (done. Kinda. Once… and then never mentioned again. I’ll rant about this one later)3. Dealing with the aftermath when she’s found out (I’m super pissed. She deals with nothing. I’ll also rant about this one in a moment)Look. I like stories about girls disguised as boys. I pretty much read all the good classic gender bender manga out there and watched all the asian dramas about the subject (there are so many) so believe me when I say I know my stuff and because I know my stuff I’m telling you this book sucks at making it believable.There’s like no tension when it comes to gender bender here. No drama. Where’s my ½ Prince or Ouran High School Host Club? Where is my Hana Kimi? Where is Coffee Prince which had 20/20 believability score in my eyes? Or Queen Seon Duk (do you know how hard it is to disguise yourself as man in a sageuk?)? Even You're Beautiful and Sungkyunkwan Scandal which ones even though I loved lack some believability handled the subject waaay better. Let me explain:** She doesnt get in the water. The other boys tease her….And then...nothing. WTF? Where is my tension and drama from that? Nothing ever really happened while she was keeping the secret and then in later books apperantly she just leaves rather than the story sticking around to deal with the consequences. It is such a letdown!** Alanna didn't seem to deal with any confusion about her identity neither in this one or the others. Like, (I’ve done some research and looked up the other books as well by reading some stuff etc.) she spent four years (?) living as a man and not once that expressed frustration that she couldn't present as she identified because that wasn't what society expected of her?  Sure, we see the first time she gets her period and thinks she’s been injured because no one explained it to her, but every subsequent time what, she just walks with an armful of bloody linens to the castle laundry room? And she just doesn’t…take off her clothes ever? She’s living with teenage boys! It’s just a concentrated locker room! All of this subterfuge seems a hundred times harder than learning to carry a shield or whatever.Which brings me to what I hate about this series the most…Reason 2:Alanna hits every single Mary Sue trope there is. She the best fighter anywhere and the prince falls in love with her and so does the super-cool Thief King and she's really beautiful and she has a freakin' magical talking/telepathic pet cat with violet eyes. You telling me she isnt Mary Sue-ish? Yeah, right. And my name is not Tamara. 
  I really like books with female protagonists, but not when they're oh-so-super special that everybody loves them instantly and they succeed at everything.
 Plus, did I mention she even has purple eyes? I did, didnt I?I'm not a fan of wish-fulfilment/power fantasies of any kind, male or female, ok? The problem with such stories is there's no tension or drama, if everything goes the protagonist's way and everything happens just as expected.Here, everything happens off screen. She studies. Secretly. For days or months to get better. And guess what? She does! Do you expect me to buy that when there was no actual build up and she is just gets so awesome at everything by practicing?!a) Cant believe she gets better at every damn thing when she studies secretly ( Why the hell I sucked at high school maths then? I studied so hard at high school and I stil sucked at logarithm no matter what.)b) We are told she studies but damn it show it to me woman!! Dont fucking try to excuse her being a master at sword fightg by studying it secretly! Where are her blood, sweat and tears? I wanna see it. I wanns see her struggling. She doesnt struggle ok? She is bullied, we are told she is bullied but because the pacing is too fucking fast I cant even feel sorry for her. What I end up thinking is ‘Maaan, she has it sooo easy’.Reason 3: I’ve learned recently that this series was originally meant as one book for the adult market but the author divided it into four and made a large amount of cuts to conform to the rules of length and content that YA Literature had in The '80s. And it shows…like from the very first page ‘cause the pacing is so off. The book -specially in the beginning- feels like a part of a spin-off series or a second book in a series instead of the first one. We are immediately thrown into the plot and the characters and cant take a second to get used to the whole thing. You know what happens when an author works under a strict maximum page limit? The pacing gets a bit wonky at times, with months or even years passed over with barely a mention. Can that be an excuse for pacing? Not for me.Reason 4: The book is ‘supposed’ to deal with gender issues. That’s what I’m told. But didnt get.  At all. Maybe it deals with heavy stuff in later boks (but if you excuse me I wont count having sex, having more than one love interest or learning how to dress as a woman as dealing with gender issues.) Maybe it gets better (I doubt it.) But you know what? That’s not an excuse. That’s what hardcore fanboys tell fans who dont want to stick around and watch a very boring and terrible season one of a series they’ve just recently started watching. ‘Hang in there buddy, it’s gonna get better. How dare you give up, you chicken!!!’.Fuck off dude, that’s not an excuse. The producers & writers should have handled the whole process better ok? The fact that it gets beter later doesnt erase all the previous moments I had to hang in there wondering why the fuck I’m still watching that boring shit. BSG had a pretty awesome first season so it can be done. First season can be cool. First book can be cool. Therefore, I dont have to stick around when the plot and character development and woldbuilding takes too damn long.  Reason 5: 
  This series it seems is famous for being Feminist Fantasy.
 I am a girl. And I consider myself a feminist. Kinda. But it seems as I realized recently I dont like feminist fantasy cause 
  
    I had the same problems I had with Graceling in this one.
  
 Like UGH. This shit is so unrealistic. For me, for this one book what the the main character does all the time is whine and bitch about how unfair it is to be born as a girl.People look at feminism in different ways. Some think it’s man-hating, some think it’s bashing woman who dont agree with them or not ‘independent’ or ‘modern’ enough like them, some think it’s doing whatever you wanna do in the name of being independent and strong, some think it’s having the mentality of ‘if a man do it, so I can’. The things we judge man for for example, some feminist act like they can get away with it and not be judged in the sake of being ‘independent’ and ‘modern’ and ‘girl power’. If you are not already guessed, I’m talking about double standard here.So yeah there is a part of feminism I dont like. I dont like when some people act like we dont need man or they dont need anybody or who the hell needs marriage and people who marry and have a kid and choose being a stay home mom for their kids are stupid. I dont like judgy people. You dont know what other people’s going through. You dont know how they were raised. Stop judging people. I dont like Allana. Because she seems like one of those judgy people. She doesnt like her gender. Fine. There were/are times I didnt/dont like my gender either. Why the hell I have to be at home before dark ‘cause it’s dangerous out there? Why the hell I have to get used to man whistling when I walk and I have to accept that they are complementing me and it’s ok? Why the fuck I have to have my period and be in pain (both physically and mentally) when the guys has it so easy? I can see someone of you nodding. But guys dont have it easy, ok? They have their own problems as well. I know that. But sometimes in some days it’s really hard to realize that. We all have those moments. We all move on. I’m totally ok with characters having those moments as well. What I’m not ok with this much gender hating. I’m suuuuure she embraces her femininity later but excuse me while I dont stick around for that. Excuse me while I dont excuse her behaviour because she’s a pre-teen and teenager. Nobody hates their gender this much. Nobody. Not even in their early years. I dont fucking care how unfair the world is. It’s unfair for everybody. You cant just make your character this kind of a special snowflake and then expect me to buy she has mentality of a 5 years old child!!Reason 6: I’m all for strong friendship but are fucking kidding me? Two people find out she’s girl and they are totally fine with that? They are ok with her lying? Where the hell all these great mentality is coming from?Dont start with me by saying : ‘…but Tamara its get better in later books'  cause I’ve done enough research to know it doesnt.  I know that Alanna revealing her gender doesn't have enough immediate consequence even in sequels.  I know that she becomes a knight and just leaves to hang out with a completely different group of people instead of staying and building on the already underdeveloped setting the series had. So I dont like that the story takes the easy way out instead of tackling the drama head on. Would have been a lot more compelling for her to learn who she was in the same area and around the same people she was trained. I personallly think it's a bad idea for writers to write around drama rather than tackle it head on. Avoiding that fallout totally kills the momentum of the series.Reason 7: Let’s talk about the villian. Let’s talk about villian being given away too damn early. I sure luv when that happens. (Can you smell my sarcasm from there?)Reason 8: Tropes present in this book include: SO MANY.** Whomever likes Alanna is good; whomever do not like Alanna is bad. Luv the whole black and white mentality this book has. (No I dont.)** Only the Chosen May Wield - Lightning aka the sword. Alana has such powerful supporters as you can see. How the hell these ordinary female characters do get supported by all these powerful beings is beyond me.** Deus ex Machina – Oh look Alanna suddenly has a magical ability I'd never heard about before to save the day. (Why? Shhh, dont ask those questions. 10 seasons of Supernatural and I’m stil not used to this shit )Let’s throw here a flashback scene to show how she learned it or just…go with it. Cause you know, she’s our little special snowflake. She was chosen. She was blessed. By the Goddess herself. Havent heard that one before. WOW. Look how amazed I am. Look. Look.Reason 9: Birth control is a necklace? Not fair.There is a magic charm to prevent pregnancy and I’m sure it’s always commonly available. Dont you just love fantasy?Alanna panics when her first period begins, gets a magical amulet and then her peridod never gets mentioned again. UGH. Dont do it if you arent going to handle the whole issue properly. For someone who freaked out so much she’s handling the whole issue so well! HAHAHAHA. When I had my first period I remember freaking out soooo much. I was at the right age but stil I freaked out like crazy cause I was alone a home and the first periods are always tricky. You have it, then you dont for like 2 months and then you have it again. Plus, it took time getting used to whole period drama. But Allana is like totally fine. She’s like so perfect guys. Even her period is perfect. So drama free. Why cant my period ever be drama free? Reason 10: Lastly, huge spoiler for the end of the series but she ends up with; George? That dude? Are you fucking kidding me? That dude who is too old for her and apperantly stalks her so much even the writer admitted she wished she never wrote that relationship? I done enough research and  I think guys who tail girls during some of their adventures and say that they're destined for each other are super creep, ok? I past my Edward the stalker stage. I dont like stalkers anymore. Sho George, sho. There's also his forcing a kiss on her immediately after promising to give her space? HAAHAHA. Come on, somebody try to explain that scene to me. I dare you :D  Overall; I’m so glad this book is over. It felt like a wasted idea that didnt fully capitalize on its potential. There's something there that COULD have been good, but the author didn't quite know what to do with it, or how to bring it out. That's why I dont like this book. Now if you excuse me I'm going to go out and get's myself an ice-cream 'cause nothing can cure a disappointing book like ice-cream :)[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",77,37
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Spencer Orey,514,108,5,"April 23, 2020","A great classic that mostly holds up today.Alanna's journey is a lot of fun. She's brave, thoughtful, and eager to learn. She works really hard, studies, and earns her way into the knighthood, all of which I found really refreshing.There were some uneven parts that all felt to me like the book had to be cut down from a longer version. The beginning felt rushed, with a lack of description, as though trying to get the reader to the good part (Alanna learning to be a knight, which WAS good!). Then the ending felt really rushed too, . But it was all a good time. In particular, I liked all the knights and their silly ""defend your honor"" chivalry stuff that was terrible and macho but made for really great reading.Onto book 2!",75,N/A
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Phrynne,"3,111",1976,4,"March 10, 2018","This is the first book in a series written for the younger end of the young adult readership, but which is still of interest to readers of any age.Alanna: The First Adventure is a fantasy set in a place where magic is common and knights are trained in the ways of chivalry. Alanna is fighting against the constraints of being female in such a society and having dressed herself as a boy she sets off to be trained as a page with the hope of a knighthood in the future. I enjoyed the story and the characters. As a young person's book it is fairly short in length and simple in its structure and interactions. It was a very pleasant, light, easy read and I would recommend it to younger readers starting out in the world of fantasy and also to young at heart readers who feel like a breath of fresh air in their reading matter.",46,2
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Mayim de Vries,576,777,3,"April 8, 2020","“Think on who you are fighting, if only because one day you must meet your match.”We are so used to feisty, kick-ass heroines that we often forget that there must have been this first one (yes, I know that’s Eowyn, thank you). And among the crowds of Arya Starks prowling the pages of virtually every contemporary fantasy novel, Alanna stands out as the pioneer(ess) and a pathbreaker. If Alanna was a real woman, today she would have been 37 years old. The book was first published in 1983, when it was fashionable to give your protagonists red hair AND purple eyes a lot of the things we take for granted now, were not so obvious at all, and many cliches were not so cliche (good point, Shaitarn!). She is a result of the “write the book you want to read” approach. Ms Pierce was forced to fill a gap in the literature, and write about fearless, bold, and powerful girls, whom (as she says) although she really wanted to, she could never become. I found it fascinating that Ms Pierce modelled Alanna on her younger sister Kimberly and even more fascinating that her first audience were her pupils from a house for teenage girls. The Head decided that some parts of the novel were inappropriate for young girls (it was a house with really strict rules) so Ms Pierce had to tell Alanna’s story in a version adapted for teenagers. (I really wish I could be there to hear this!)I suppose, there was no need to adapt the first adventure as the novel is definitely more middle-grade than YA. It is a cozy and fast flowing comfort read. You don’t even notice when you are 50 pages into the story. The world is of the magically flavoured Middle Ages variety, but it is a comfort world too. So if a thief asks you for a meeting it is not aimed at robbing you blindly (among other nasty things) but you will get lemonade and gain a friend instead (in some respects this reminded me of Riryia a bit).“Alanna left the class thinking, something she seldom did seriously.”Alanna is a classic girl-in-boy’s-clothing tale of a girl who wanted to be a knight so much, he swapped places in her brother and went to the “special school” (another favourite trope!) where everybody thinks her to be one Lord Alan of Trebon. She is a wonderfully constructed heroine. Alanna has both a gift for killing and for healing, she is a girl with boyish dreams and thus she is made of delicious contradictions that make her so interesting and alive. She is also beautifully flawed: when she comes to the court she is a bit lazy and spoilt (the tantrum she throws when it transpires that becoming a knight actually involves a lot of work is simply delicious). Interestingly, she does not have the empathy (typically bestowed upon female protagonists). Feeling and thinking are not her fortes; instead, she is the embodiment of action. She has everything that Disgraceling has lost and Harry never had. And although Alanna lacks discipline or intellectual depths, she is smart and hard-working. Nothing comes cheap but she is prepared to pay the full price, no discount  hence when she finally did get that magic sword in the end, I held no grudge. She entirely deserved it.I will be definitely continuing the series even though I can already smell the upcoming love triangle that is bound to be more YA in the coming instalments. The First Adventure is just a compacted prelude into the setting that introduces the world and the main characters, both good and bad. Despite several “jumps” in time, the main current of the story flows rather smoothly. Please be warned that the “special school” is not the main thing here and so if you are excited about the academy, reign your hogwarts hopes in and try Inda or the Blood Song instead. I have been a bit apprehensive and I didn’t want to indulge in hate-reading. (The thing is: classics, unless read early, can be a terrible hit and miss. And I seem to be missing far too often.) Luckily, Alanna was a pleasant surprise and my fears proved to be unfounded. Try it if you are in a mood for something a bit vintage and a bit naive. 2. In the Hand of the Goddess ★☆☆☆☆3.

13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Gavin Hetherington,665,5291,4,"January 12, 2021","I read this one for my Patron-exclusive readalong for the Song of a Lioness series and I was so pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this. I had never heard of it before and when I heard it's from the 80s, I was so worried that it would be dated and not hold up today. I am so happy that it's a book I would whole-heartedly recommend!Alanna of Trebond has her heart set on becoming a knight, while her brother wants to learn magic, so they decide to switch places so Alanna could go to the castle of King Roald and start training as a knight. Having to hide her true identity while also proving herself, Alanna faces so many challenges and obstacles. I loved a lot of the themes and messages this book conveys, that girls can do what boys do if given a chance. I can see this being such a hugely influential read for so many young people and it's a book I would absolutely give to my niece to teach her that she can do anything she puts her mind to. Seeing Alanna's journey and struggle felt so real inside a truly fantasy world. It's a coming of age, as she grows up and deals with real issues too. I loved the 'swords and sorcery' aspect of this, again an element I wasn't really expecting. There are some interesting developments that happen to keep the story exciting, such as a mystical sickness and a finale in the ruins of the Black City. There are villains to deal with and while I did find some of it a little rushed, I was still fully immersed in this world.I look forward to continuing this series and I'm grateful to everyone who yelled at me to begin this.

13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Choko,"1,166",2568,4,"January 17, 2020","*** 4.44 ***I wish I had read this book when I was in my preteens and early teens, because if I had, it would have definitely been a favorite! Getting up there in age, as I am, I still found this Fantasy fairy tale very pleasant and engaging. The tale of tweens who switch places is a well worn trope, as well as the one about the girl who wants to be respected as the boys are, but the author does a great job keeping the themes fresh and by creating likable characters, keeps the reader invested in the story all the way. I would strongly recommend this book to the young Fantasy readers out there! It is a short and very easy flowing read, leaving you rooting for the good vs evil! If I had kids, I would be reading it to them 👍!Now I wish you all happy reading and may you always find what you need in the pages of a good book♥️!",37,1 comment
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Donna,"1,050",49,2,"December 19, 2008","I probably would have liked this better if I'd read it for the first time when I was younger. The heroine is a fairly typical spunky fantasy female, she's a little too perfect and good at everything. The story is okay but not especially memorable. It takes place over several years, though the passage of time seems a little muddy and the only real sense of it is that sometimes Alanna will mention her age. It's written in third person, and for the most part we're only in Alanna's head. But there are occasionally parts where we're reading about what another character is thinking, those moments are jarring and don't always seem to serve much purpose.",34,19
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Bookishrealm,"1,778",4479,5,"March 1, 2021","This was such a huge surprise. I was not expecting to enjoy this one as much as I did and I definitely will say that it holds up considering that it was originally written in the 80sAlanna: The First Adventure is the first book in the Song of the Lioness Quartet and focuses on Alanna's journey in ""switching roles"" with her brother so that she can become a knight. There's a lot of assumptions that can be made about a fantasy book that was originally made in the 80's; however, Pierce was definitely far beyond her time in both plot and character development. There are great relationships that Alanna develops with her the other boys that are training to become knights. Even in the light of some absentee parents, Alanna is able to form great bonds with other adults. I did appreciate that Pierce allowed Alanna to be flawed. This is especially noticeable when Alanna makes it to castle and believes that her previous training is going to make her excel in everything. Of course, things go a little differently and she has to put in time and energy like all the other participants. There were a few aspects that I did not expect Peirce to cover related to puberty. Naturally, Alanna is going to change developmentally as she ages; however, I expected Pierce to ignore that. And surprisingly she didn't. There were great conversations related to physical changes that were probably monumental for readers when this was first released. Pierce definitely took this opportunity to carve the way for women in fantasy in a time when it was predominately dominated by men. While I do think that the presentation of gender is outdated, Peirce did a hell of a job for the time in which she released this book. I've heard that her books only get better with time. This was definitely a great read and I look forward to reading more from her.",32,2

Alanna and that wonderful pack of boys all came rushing back to me, more than a decade since I last read this; the definition of memorable characters. And the pacing! I'd forgotten how briskly this book MOVES.I think I first discovered Tamora Pierce in high school, thanks to an upperclassman friend who took me under her wing. Lots of feelings right now. It's been so long since I visited Tortall.I still want to read that 732-page adult version of the quartet, Tammy!",31,13
13831,Alanna The First Adventure,Dannii Elle,"1,966",1380,3,"August 8, 2019","This the first instalment in the Song of the Lioness quartet. There are few fantasy adventures I embark on that can be classified as fun and light-hearted yet sometimes that is exactly what I need. Pierce delivers the most charming of story-lines and all of her books, that I have so far read, are all formulated with solely the reader's enjoyment in mind. This book did feel suited to a younger audience, with the straight-forward narrative and the hasty instalment of the reader into the world, but also delivered all of the playfulness, light-hearted humour, and general fun reading experience that I was anticipating. Grimdark is where my heart lays by Pierce is where i return to when I need a pure escapist, pleasure of a read.",29,N/A
