  A gritty romance filled with lustful banter between two characters that fight their attraction, but slowly open their hearts for more...
Okay, okay... I mean like HELLO?! Can Helena Hunting stop it with the perfection that is her writing? Officially my first favorite book of 2020 and I am not regretting anything... I mean, why would I? Helena never seems to disappoint you at all when it comes down to characters that seriously have the best of the best in chemistry. My gosh, nothing can go wrong with this book. Stevie and Bishop have this banter to them but has you twisting and turning for more of the story because all you want is for them to just rip their clothes off and rub against each other... yes... I said rub against each other. Obviously they do more than that **wink wink** and I just love everything about it.From weirded topping pizza's, to boxer shorts that will have you drooling over what is packing on the inside‚ÄîHelena brings a brand new witty banter of a novel that will bring your knees weak and wanting more of Stevie and Bishop. Especially when the truth prevails about who Stevie is related to, the one person in which Bishop dislikes the most. But that does not stop them from catching each other from far away, from each other's peep holes wanting to know who comes out first to get the paper, or from trying to deny that being just friends is just not enough for two people who's physical attraction is beyond more then just sex, but so much more. And that's the endearing part of it all, just loving more and more of what Stevie and Bishop become.This romance novel is one that you do not want to miss out on. And yes, though it is part of a series, you can read it as a standalone, but I would not recommend doing so since the first novel is incredible as well! Thank you to SBPR for the copy, I am excited for everyone to throughly enjoy this story as much as I did... and my eyes and hands are ready for the third novel, because I can already tell that Kingston will be my ultimate favorite with how sweet and such a gentlemen he truly is. Helena, GIVE. ME. THAT. BOOK. RIGHT. NOW!ARC kindly provided by Montlake Romance, in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Instagram ‚ùÅ Twitter",159,12

    I need you to stop touching me!‚Äù It‚Äôs stupid because I‚Äôm still holding on to her, not the other way around. ‚ÄúWhy are you yelling at me?‚Äù she shouts back. ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre half-undressed in my tub,and I‚Äôm a guy, and apparently my dick is a fucking sadist.

FAVORITE. HELENA HUNTING BOOK. EVER. How do you even top this? This book was EVERYTHING. The blurb was amazing but it didn't even begin to do this justice. I loved the first in the series, but this story just owned me. It was enemies to lovers with a slow burn to beat all slow burns. It was full of banter and humor and all of the sizzle. GAH! I seriously can't right now with all of my feels!!These two were easily my favorite characters that Helena Hunting has created to date. Stevie is RJ's younger sister from A Lie for a Lie. She's feisty, sharp-witted, and currently trying to move on from walking in on her boyfriend having sex with another woman in their bed. The bed in the apartment they just moved into together. The apartment that they got because of a job they both got and will be working together at. Good times. As she runs away to lick her wounds, looking a hot mess, her brother offers up his condo to her. So of course as fate would have it, what happens when everything that can go wrong does and you're looking a hot mess trying to get the key to work to your temporary new gigs? You run into your ridiculously good looking but terribly tempered neighbor.To say that these two get off on the wrong foot would be a serious understatement. While Stevie is dealing with her new normal, she now has to deal with her grumpy new neighbor that happens to assume that she's his married teammate's sidepiece. So suffice it to say, he's not that happy to see her. No matter that the relationship between RJ and Bishop is antagonistic at best.These two begin an intricate dance of antagonism laced with enough sexual tension to set their condo building on fire. It's enemies to lovers at it's very best. With amazing banter, sizzling chemistry, and all of the funny barbs and one-liners. When Bishop gets dangerously hurt during a game, he's desperate to get back on his feet. And then Stevie offers him her help. She's a physiotherapist specializing in sports therapy. It's a great arrangement. A favor for a favor. She'd help get him back on the ice, and he'd give her the chance to work with her first professional athlete and make a name for herself without her brother's help. Thus begins an even more intricate dance of denying their chemistry as they're forced in tight quarters and to be around each other a lot more often.Bishop was such an amazing hero. This man is brooding, and while looks are deceiving, he's not the typical man-whoring athlete. He takes care of his younger brother and focuses on his career. He has no time for a woman, until one quite literally stumbles into his life.This was such a delicious story. I don't even have all of the words to describe how good. The chemistry was incendiary, the humor was on point, and the story was addictive. Pure perfection on pages. I can't recommend it enough. If you've been living under a rock and haven't read a Helena Hunting book yet, then this is the perfect one to hook you with!ARC courtesy of publisher in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:  ",150,3

    For so many reasons we probably shouldn't fit¬†together, but we do.
  
¬†I am so happy I continued on with this series! After not loving the first book (it had my least favorite troupe :/, I was a bit anxious to try this one. I love Helena Hunting‚Äôs writing and humor, so I thought I‚Äôd give it a go and it paid off big time! I absolutely loved this. Stevie and Bishop were the best and their romance was so much fun! If you‚Äôve read the first book in this series (A Lie for a Lie) you‚Äôve met Rook‚Äôs sister, Stevie, and his nemesis teammate, Bishop. This is their romance. Stevie and Bishop become neighbors when Stevie takes over Rook‚Äôs apartment. They have a bit of a tumultuous start to their friendship, but with time, they become friends. Or frienemies. Bishop is a pro in the NHL and gets an injury and needs some extra PT to heal faster. Stevie just happens to be a PT. Stevie would love to have a pro-athlete on her client list (that‚Äôs not her brother) so these two decide to help each other out. A favor for a favor. Stevie and Bishop had the most insane amount of chemistry. I loved how their relationship started a bit rocky, almost like an enemies, to friends, to lovers story. Stevie was fun and feisty and Bishop was my favorite type of broody hero, but as Stevie got to really know him, he showed her a different side to himself. 
  Bishop is a lot of things: sarcastic, assholey,¬†determined, hotheaded, and a¬†mammoth of a man. But his kiss is all the other¬†parts of him I've gotten glimpses of over the past several weeks: sweet,¬†gentle, soft.
This book reminded me of why I love Helena Hunting so much. I love her characters, I love her humor, and I love the way she pulls me into a story and has me so invested. I‚Äôve just now read the blurb for the third book in this series (Kingston‚Äôs story) and OMG. I cannot wait for it! A Favor for a Favor was a hilarious, sweet, emotional and sexy sports romance that I highly recommend! ",80,2

The Story: Bishop meets Stevie in the hall of his penthouse apartment on the night when she catches her boyfriend. She was having a bad day and having to move into her brothers penthouse in the middle of the night wasn‚Äôt helping any. The two are immediately acrimonious and end up having a very odd relationship from the start.  Bishop doesn‚Äôt like wearing clothes while at home since he is always warm and has a thing for non-standard underwear. After seeing him in nothing but his shorts a few days in a row, she decides to give him a taste of his own medicine. I really enjoyed these two and their banter. And the intimate scenes were sizzling, especially due to the fact that his groin injury made them wait quite a while. Helena Hunting does sports romance like nobody‚Äôs business and I loved every minute of it. I am not big on watching sports, but I do love Hockey and Hockey players. The narration is dual POV and dual narration, done by Jacob Morgan and Erin Mallon. Erin Mallon is great as usual. I like that she talks pretty fast and her man voice is much better than most female narrators and Jacob Morgan has a deep and sexy voice that I really enjoy.Blog|Goodreads|Facebook|Instagram|Twitter|BookBub",60,2
50155745,A Favor for a Favor,NMmomof4,"1,479",3483,4,"February 15, 2020"," 4 StarsOverall Opinion: This was better than I expected! I really loved the slow progression into feelings and even bed for these two! I appreciated that they talked about the hard stuff when they were developing feelings to help me connect with the characters at a deeper level. I enjoyed their banter and how they went from instant dislike to much, much more. My biggest gripe is the end. It didn't give me nearly enough and was too close to the conflict being resolved for me to call it a HEA. Overall, a great surprise and a fun book! Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Stevie and Bishop's story. Stevie moved to Seattle for a new job and is shocked to find her boyfriend that she's moving in with with another woman. She takes her brother's empty condo that he gets for being a NHL player and meets Bishop the night she moves in. Bishop automatically assumes that Stevie is her brother's mistress and doesn't give her the nicest welcoming for moving across the hall. They start off a battle of sorts but when Bishop gets hurt in an off season game, Stevie decides to negotiate and change their relationship to a beneficial one for each of them since she is starting her physiotherapist career. There are some laugh out loud moments, a few hot sexy times, and some past baggage that effects the couple...but they get a HFN ending.Point Of View (POV): This alternated between Stevie and Bishop's POV.Overall Pace of Story:  Good. I never skimmed and I thought it flowed well.Instalove: No, they take a while to develop stronger feelings.H (Hero) rating: 4.5 stars. Bishop. I really liked him! He was broody but sweet on the inside and super caring (and sexy)!h (heroine) rating: 4 stars. Stevie. I liked her. She was fun, sassy, and smart. I didn't, however, really like her when she was pushing the H away towards the end.Sadness level: Low, no tissues neededPush/Pull: Yes  They both have reasons for not pursuing a relationship, so they both push away at times. I'd say they both also pursue the relationship at times as well.Heat level: Hot. They have some hot tension, chemistry, and scenes -- but only one big scene and not so much it takes away from the story. It doesn't happen until the second half of the book, so I'd say it's more of a slow burn with the heat.Descriptive sex: YesOW (Other Woman)/OM (Other Man) drama: Yes  The h's ex wants her back and causes some (mild) drama Sex scene with OW or OM: NoCheating:  NoSeparation: Yes, but very short They are separated shortly (days or a week?), and there was no mention or suggestion of other partners during this time. Possible Triggers: Yes  The h was cheated on by her ex, loss of a parent (h - off page), and a sibling with medical issues (H - on page)Closure:  This ended way too abruptly for me! I wanted to see their HEA!! I would call this a HFN ending even though many readers would probably be fine with calling this a HEA they get engaged and got a houseSafety: This one should be Safe for most safety gang readers- Does Not have cheating- Does Not have a descriptive sex scene with OW/OM-  Does have the h and H pushing away-  Does have a separation between the h and H-  Does Not have abuse- Does Not  have a HEA ending (see above)",55,4

Bishop Winslow is an NHL player for the brand new expansion team in Seattle. He‚Äôs getting used to a new team, and settling into a new routine. He needs his sleep, so he‚Äôs not too thrilled when a hot mess of a woman is making all kinds of noise at midnight trying to get into his team captain‚Äôs penthouse apartment. He automatically thinks the worst of her. He later learns his new pink haired neighbor is his teammate‚Äôs little sister, but not before he makes a terrible first impression.Stevie Bowman is a 24 yr. old woman who is fresh from graduate school and about to start her new job as a physiotherapist. She‚Äôs just arrived in Seattle, and nothing goes as planned. She‚Äôs an emotional mess, and her professional hockey star brother offers up his empty apartment for her to stay in. When she‚Äôs at her lowest, she meets her insanely hot new neighbor who is also full of attitude. He might be a jerk with a horrible personality, but he sure is easy on the eyes.
  
Suddenly Bishop is benched after he gets injured. He needs to get back on the ice sooner rather than later, so when his feisty neighbor offers her PT skills to him, he will do anything to heal faster. This includes trying to be professional, and resist the undeniable attraction between them. Rehabbing an NHL player will be great for Stevie‚Äôs career, but trying to ignore the chemistry that sizzles every time she puts her hands on him is about to drive her crazy. He‚Äôs a gorgeous man, and it‚Äôs hard to pretend she doesn‚Äôt want him desperately. As they get more attached, and their connection grows, they have trouble fighting their feelings.

It is comical romantic and filled with unique and interesting characters. I truly enjoyed every character and moment between Stevie and Bishop. Stevie is a heroine who is totally relatable. The reader understands how hard it would be to live in the shadow of your famous brother and to always question people‚Äôs motives. I enjoyed her temperament and her choices, and I loved her as an individual.Bishop is a bit surly, which is understandable based on his current athletic and life changes. He has a lot riding on his shoulders, and he carries it without complaint. I truly loved the side of him that Stevie brought out, more fun and light hearted. I fell in love with him and he fell in love with her. Some couples just have it on the page, and Stevie and Bishop do. From the banter to the sexual tension, I was enthralled by the evolution of their relationship. It was a fantastic and entertaining romance that I couldn‚Äôt put down. Helena Hunting has a knack for taking unique and interesting characters and giving them depth, real 3d layers to who they are. Their flaws are relatable, the characters are lovable, and she gives a romance that is applicable to all people. That is why she is a favorite of mine. ARC REVIEW",42,2

They started with a really wrong foot, since he thought that she was RJ's sidepiece, and couldn't stop of being a real asshole to her.She didn't back up and fight him at every turn, meaning their exchanges and (hallway underwear) exchanges, became a really funny thing.This book is a reaaaally slow burn.They start as enemies, and then evolve to a mutual agreement, since she's a physical therapist and he's injured.But after a few weeks working together, they start to become friends...It's really sweet how they both struggle to accept their feelings, but my missing start is also for the same motive.It took too long to them to really BE together, and just for only a chapter before they separate again.It was a bone killer, as Bishop said. üòÇLove the cameos, and Violet is still crazy and always pregnant!I love how it ended though.
