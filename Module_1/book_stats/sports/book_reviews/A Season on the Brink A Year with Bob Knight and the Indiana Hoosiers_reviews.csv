75639,A Season on the Brink A Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers,Tom Stamper,571,24,5,"February 16, 2021","John Feinsten took a sabbatical from the Washington Post and spent the 1985-86 season embedded with the Indiana Hoosiers basketball team. Coach Knight already had 2 National Championships trophies, but was coming off a horrendous season at Indiana. Despite being preseason number 4, the Hoosiers didn't even make the 64 team March Madness tournament that year. Coaching was starting to become a chore and he wasn't sure he had enough talent on his team to compete in the Big Ten. These were guys that were going to have to follow his program to succeed and he wasn't optimistic. The book takes you through the experience of being a college athlete in this regimented program. For instance, they ate the same thing at every pregame meal. They had hamburgers, spaghetti, pancakes, eggs, and vanilla ice cream for dessert. Sometimes it was spaghetti at 9am when they played at noon. The players hardly talked through the meal. Their job was to eat and concentrate on their game plan. Knight was an Army guy who coached at West Point. He treated college basketball like a war because life is a war. He made the kids in his program tough so they not only survived college but they were better prepared to take on life. We know that he would later be fired for treating college basketball like combat because a younger generation of students and even college officials had a softer life and an expectation of being treated like men before they earned it. Feinstein seems to understand this intuitively although he doesn't doesn't make the direct correlation as to how the President that hired him grew up in an America of depressions and world wars. The president that fired him in 2000 was an academic Knight's age and his America never fought a war where we could have lost the American way of life. I grew up in Indiana and I remember this team pretty well. I had always wondered why the highly touted Delray Brooks washed out of the program and Feinstein explains not only the saga but why Brooks's talent wasn't the right kind of fit for Knight's program. Knight only saw Brooks play once in high school and he was in foul trouble. He listened to his assistants that talked of his great talent, but weren't experienced in constructing a team. Knight didn't choose Charles Barkley to be on the Gold Meal Olympic team in 1984 because he was talented but not coach-able. Brooks was a great kid and coachable but his talents weren't symbiotic with the rest of the team. If there is one thing that Feinstein captures is why Bobby Knight was successful coaching in a program that produced so few NBA superstars. Isiah Thomas is the only one I can think of. Knight success rested on his ability to take marginal players and talented unskilled athletes and make them work as a team by teaching them to be better at the skills they had and by relying on teammates that had complimentary skills. His drilling was an attempt to scare the bad decisions out of them. If they executed smart basketball they could overcome the teams with more talent. He and his teams watched game tapes again and again looking for how an opponent would play and how his kids should counter. I thought the histrionics on the court and in press conferences was simply hating to lose, but as you follow him for a season he seems more upset that the games they lost presented opportunities for victory that the players didn't seize. It was the failure at execution and thus a personal failure in his coaching that these guys didn't listen well enough. Feinstein's title Season on the Brink is suggesting that the team was on the brink of collapse. But it was a prescient title because the season following this they won their third national title under Knight ,and it turns out that this was a season was on the brink of greatness. The most intriguing thing about the book was why Bobby Knight would give John Feinstein the kind access considering how much the coach disliked the depiction. What you learn in the book is that Knight hated the press but he counted many actual reporters as loyal friends. Feiunstein came to his attention when he put the chair throwing episode into perspective. Throwing the chair during a game was a venal sin compared to numerous dirty programs around the country that recruited illegally by letting the alumni buy players. This was the beginning of when college basketball was becoming big money but Knight wasn't interested in winning with kids who weren't interested in getting an education along the way. He saw scholarship as a sign of dedication and he needed that attribute to win on the court as well. His graduation rates showed this. Feinstein acknowledged it. Knight appreciated the acknowledgment. I'm guessing where Feinstein went wrong was the coach saw this book as a betrayal of their friendship not because it wasn't true, but maybe because he thought it would play into the narratives of his detractors. I have read that later books explain more of the mitigating circumstances behind much of his actions. But Feinstein tells many a story of Knight's generosity to fans and former players. He is friendly with most of the coaching fraternity. I don't think I would have enjoyed playing for the coach, but playing for him would have made any of us more successful as adult human beings. Personal NotesA few weeks ago I was talking to a co-worker during the events surrounding the Super Bowl. I'm not sure how the subject came up, but she use to date the Orlando Magic guard, Scott Skiles. Skiles is playing for Michigan State during the events in the book and he is the player Indiana has to beat to win. Skiles is a great player but his arrests for cocaine possession and intoxication made him the kind of player Bobby Knight avoided. The book also talks about Knight's recruiting trips to my old high school to scout Shawn Kemp. Feinstein misspells his name. Kemp was year behind me and a raw talent. I don't think I saw him make a shot outside of 10 feet all season, but his size and athleticism made our team hard to beat. Shawn had a long NBA career and he became a greater shooter. If he had been that well rounded in high school we would have won a few state championships. I don't know if Shawn ever wanted to play at Indiana, but he wasn't the kind of student that Knight chose and his low SAT score kept him from playing as a Freshman in college and eventually just entered the NBA draft where he too would one day play for the Magic. I was doing some show in college during the 1992 Final Four game between Duke and Indiana. I don't remember the show we were doing, but I had a small part and would come off the stage to the green room and watch the game. We had an unlikable professor whose son went to Duke so I wasn't alone rooting for the Hoosiers. If I remember it looked like they had that game won or at least the momentum but then it all unraveled at the end. I didn't know at the time that the Duke Coach was a player and coach for Knight at Army. I can pronounce his name but I don't feel like looking up the spelling. That was the last great team Knight had at Indiana. Calbert Chaney and Damon Bailey.I liked Bobby Knight because I was from Indiana and he brought national championships. Had I been from Michigan I would have hated him. Now that I have read this book I realize I could have learned to love him even if I had been from Michigan. ",3,2
75639,A Season on the Brink A Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers,Don,294,3,5,"December 24, 2021","This is a ""sports book"" that should appeal to most readers. Its subject matter, Bobby Knight, is fascinating, just a strange and brilliant and altogether unique human being. Knight gave the book's author, sports journalist John Feinstein, unprecedented access to the Indiana Hoosiers’ basketball team throughout its 1985-86 season, and Feinstein responded by telling all that seemed worth telling.Knight is presented as both hero and villain, a funny, at times magnanimous soul who could also be a real jerk, one who heaped untold verbal abuse on his players. ""You know what you are Daryl?"" he tells his center, Daryl Thomas, at one point. ""You are the worst fucking pussy I've ever seen play basketball at this school. The absolute worst pussy ever. You have more goddamn ability than 95 percent of the players we've had here but you are a pussy from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet. An absolute fucking pussy. That's my assessment of you after three years.""The book's structure is inherently dramatic. Really any sports book can easily possess a page-turning three-act structure. Act I, Setup: It's preseason, and the coach assesses his ragtag assembly of players, seeing both possibilities and problems. Act II, Rising Action: The season begins, the team faces one challenge after another, the stakes rising as the postseason approaches. Act III, Resolution: The Big Game is played, the team's mettle is ultimately and finally tested. Feinstein recounts each game with a fair amount of detail, but I think that even these parts can be enjoyed by non-sports fans. His prose is simple and clean — “Alford and Calloway lit up creaky old Jenison and by halftime the lead was 48-35, Alford ending it with a spinning twelve-footer just before the buzzer” — but his real purpose in recounting these games is to further elucidate Knight's personality. With every missed shot, with every rebound, we find ourselves wondering how Knight will respond. Will he again erupt in fury? Will he manage to calm his own emotions and find a way to instill some confidence into his struggling players? Knight was in many ways a brilliant coach, and A Season on the Brink can at times be read as a work of performance psychology. It's instructive to learn how Knight thought and the strategies he employed to get the most from his players. Far too often, however, Knight's tempestuous nature took over, and he didn't seem able to keep that nature in check. There was undoubtedly method to his madness, but it appears that the madness, or at least its intensity, was often beyond his control. In the end, this turns out to be less a work of performance psychology than a modern Greek tragedy.",3,N/A
75639,A Season on the Brink A Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers,Robert Poor,260,23,5,"August 4, 2022","""A Season on the Brink: A Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers"" by John Feinstein is a remarkable book. Remarkable for the breadth and depth of access Bob Knight granted to a journalist and remarkable for the behind the scenes look at, despite his profanity, bullyness and mercurial mood swings, one of the greatest basketball coaches of all time. ""Season"" follows Bob Knight throughout the tumultuous 1985-1986 season, a year before Knight and IU again win the NCAA tournament, and a year after Knight's infamous throwing-the-chair moment during a sideline tirade.I have mixed feelings about Bob Knight. Some of my earliest memories watching basketball with my father involved Bob Knight and the 1975-76 IU team that went undefeated. As a senior in high school, I watched Bob Knight and the Hoosiers win a second title. By its third championship, I was deployed aboard the USS Enterprise halfway around the world. Throughout that entire period, Bob Knight's IU teams could be expected to play smart, disciplined, team basketball - a perfect example for a young midwestern boy/man heading off to the Naval Academy and a career in the Navy. Throughout the period, there were also increasingly loud whispers of Bob Knight's exploits - some lovely (helping out a family in need, assisting an old player who fell on hard times, putting in a good word for an up and coming coach) - and some truly horrid. Over time the horrid began to outweigh the excellence of his teams. My father went from being a Knight fan to rooting against him. I thought Knight's mind games were remnants from an era gone by, and that basketball and society had passed him by. In his book, John Feinstein does a remarkable job of showing us the Good Bob and Bad Bob. Toward the end, Knight makes a point that ""the ends justify the means."" I do not agree. But the incongruity of a great basketball mind inside an often troubled man makes for great reading.I recently listened to a Bill Simmons podcast in which he and several sportswriters discussed their Top Ten or so favorite sports books. ""A Season on the Brink"" was firmly high on each sportswriter's list. In 2002, in its Top 100 Sports Books article, Sports Illustrated listed ""A Season on the Brink"" as the sixth greatest sports book of all time, in between #5 ""You Know Me Al"" by Ring Lardner (1914) and #7 ""Semi-Tough"" by Dan Jenkins (1972). [#1 was ""The Sweet Science,"" a book about boxing by A.J. Liebling (1956).]""Season"" is highly recommended. For those interested, the Sports Illustrated article is available on line.",3,N/A

I know he's extremely emotional, dictatorial, self-centered and obsessive while also being a pretty good-seeming guy, but I have no idea how he became the winningnest coach in D1 college ball history.

Growing up as an IU fan in the heyday of Bob Knight I loved reading this. It is an interesting insight into the mindset of a consummate competitor. I also enjoyed the insights into the people around the program and all of the connectivity in the college BB world. Fair warning, there is a not insignificant amount of language, but that shouldn’t surprise anyone. I will probably read some other books by Feinstein as he did an amazing job on this. ",1 like,N/A

Was it worth my time? No...not really. It's 300 pages of the same thing over and over and over. Plus, bad writing doesn't help, either, with some of the biggest excuses made for Bobby Knight's absurd, assholish behavior which involves treating people like children at all times. Parts of the book feel like watching the game without having actually seen it on TV in spite of me not being in the mood. Whatever the team accomplished during that season, who really cares? They won the national title the following year. Once again, who really cares? Nobody remembers that crap. The real losers are Bobby Knight and the ones who put up with him.

75639,A Season on the Brink A Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers,Parker Dalton,106,1 follower,5,"March 17, 2017","So fascinating to read this book about Bob Knight. 2nd most wins in college in college basketball history, just behind his former player Coach K. He is such an enigma. Fiery temper, little control of his emotions, demanding perfection, and he gets the absolute most out of his teams ability and heart. Despite how unbelievably hard he is on his teams, most former players say he is the best college coach ever. Reading this book reminded me a lot of Walter Isaacson's book on Steve Jobs. In fact, both men remind me a lot of each other. Grew up as the only child in the family, demanding personality, expects absolute excellence and yet expects even more from himself, sees losing as a direct reflection of himself, little to no control of his emotions and can swing back and forth quickly from calm to highly agitated, and both men were able to lead others to do absolutely extraordinary things. They both made a ""dent in their universe"". As a former college baseball player, it wouldn't be my way as a coach, and I'm not sure I could have played for him and survived, but I am almost drawn to how much he got out of his players. What was it that made him win so many Big Ten titles, a gold medal, and 3 national championships? How did he get his players to deliver every drop of talent out of their basketball skills? If you like basketball, leadership, coaching, or just want to read about one of the most controversial coaches in basketball, this is your book.",N/A,N/A
75639,A Season on the Brink A Year with Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers,Tim,39,2,3,"May 19, 2019","Considering there was an ESPN movie made about this (that I never watched), I assumed the book was better. The book is about Bob Knight’s Indiana Hoosiers the year after they flamed out in 1984-85. This book shows that Bobby Knight is a toxic person who played mind games with his players, didn’t praise players until they were gone (and that was to put down players currently on the team), and he also was incapable of driving his son the same way. The book tries to show his positives, his humor, and his ability to coach but the book is just there.What is most frustrating is in places where the author spoils any potential drama by revealing the result before the game occurs in the book.
