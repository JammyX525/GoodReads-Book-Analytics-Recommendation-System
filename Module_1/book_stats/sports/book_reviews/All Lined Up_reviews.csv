18505845,All Lined Up,Pearl Angeli,622,942,4,"October 27, 2016","4 Daredevil Stars!My expectations were met when I thought I would love a Cora Carmack book. Her books have been on my radar since 2014, but because too many books too little time, it was only two days ago when I had my first taste of her work. And it certainly did not fail.
  
    ""Do you ever think that maybe that's all people do? Fix some things and break others? And we all just live in this giant cycle where we screw things up and hurt people we love, and then we turn around and try to atone for that by fixing other things. And maybe we're all just waiting on our turn for a broken heart and the person who will fix it.""
  
All Lined Up's plot revolves around two characters Dallas Cole and Carson McClain. Both students of Rusk University in Texas, their attraction started when they met in very strange situation while they were at a college party. However, no matter how strong their connection is, their booming relationship is bound to doom since Carson is one of the football players of Rusk where Dallas's father is the coach. Since Carson has a goal of becoming a full scholar at the University, he vowed to never let Dallas become a distraction for his plans. But their chemistry is of course so strong that they find it hard to resist each other.I am generally a sucker for college romance that has sports element so basically I expected this book to knock me off my feet. I ended up adoring it because Cora Carmack's writing matches my taste. There was absolutely something beautiful about the way she writes a sweet book with a bit of an angst and mild steam. At first I was afraid that I would end up disliking it since the storyline is already worn out. The book reminds me of Whatever Life Throws at You and Moonshot where the heroines' dads are heads of a certain sports team. But even if All Lined Up has a similarity to those books, it differs when it comes to the characterizations. Dallas is one likeable character. I love that she knows what she wants to pursue in life which is dancing and how she's very determined to attain it. Her relationship with her dad is so genuine that at times I was teary-eyed. Even when she's growing up without a mom, she turned out such a strong girl. Carson, on the other hand, is also a character that's worthy of admiration. He is not a typical sports hero who gets all the attention of the girls on campus. He is so down to earth. Growing up in a family who lacks sufficient money to support him in his education made him become a responsible, goal-driven person and that makes him my favorite character.
  
    ""I can't walk away from you because I don't want to. There are a thousand things I want and need to do, but you trump all of them You drive me to distraction, and all I want to do is get lost in you. All I want to do is make you lose it, too.""
  
The romantic development in this book is one of my most favorites. Dallas and Carson's relationship was not forced. It developed so naturally. I loved how they shared each moment even if they were just stolen. I also loved that they are both family-oriented and that they learn lessons from each other as their relationship progressed.All in all, it was a sweet and cute college sports romance. I couldn't agree more with everyone who attest that Cora Carmack is a great story-teller. It's proven. I can't wait to read the next books in this series and the author's other works.

  not
 a fan of that genre, I didn’t think I’d enjoy it much. Was I ever wrong!Description…In Texas, two things are cherished above all else—football and gossip. My life has always been ruled by both.Dallas Cole loathes football. That's what happens when you spend your whole childhood coming in second to a sport. College is her time to step out of the bleachers, and put the playing field (and the players) in her past.But life doesn't always go as planned. As if going to the same college as her football star ex wasn’t bad enough, her father, a Texas high school coaching phenom, has decided to make the jump to college ball… as the new head coach at Rusk University. Dallas finds herself in the shadows of her father and football all over again.Carson McClain is determined to go from second-string quarterback to the starting line-up. He needs the scholarship and the future that football provides. But when a beautiful redhead literally falls into his life, his focus is more than tested. It's obliterated.Dallas doesn't know Carson is on the team. Carson doesn't know that Dallas is his new coach's daughter.And neither of them know how to walk away from the attraction they feel.My review…My biggest beef with the New Adult genre isn’t so much about the stories themselves but about where I am in my own life and what I want to read. Though I suppose I do fall into the New Adult age group of early 20s to 30s – having been 27 years old for far longer than I want to admit – I just can’t cope with the angst and the drama and the relationship hogwash that seems to go hand in hand with these stories. That said, yes there was some of that here - though not the kind that makes you want to commit road rage - but most importantly there was also something so sweet, so fun, so romantic, so sexy, so inspiring, so, so right about All Lined Up that I couldn’t help but love it!Dallas and Carson are great characters who stole my heart! They live and love like people who have their hopes and dreams laid out before them, theirs for the taking if they only reach for them, work for them, earn them - because they are those people! How could I not love them?The bottom line…The New Adult genre gets a lot of grief from readers but the truth is, it fills a very important niche in romance reading. If you’ve stayed clear of it because you just don’t want the relationship garbage and added angst in your escapism reading, I urge you to give this story a try. In a genre filled with too much of the same old, same old, Cora Carmack is an exciting, fresh voice and her Rusk University series promises to be a winner!An eARC of All Lined Up was provided by Avon Books via Edelweiss, and in return I’m giving them an honest review.",77,51

The hero of this story is a football player who falls for a girl at a party. He doesn’t know it right away… but this girl is his coaches daughter. Carson was fantastic, Dallas was great, it was an all around good read. I listened to the audio of this one and I thought the narration was pretty good.

No HEA:   Yes Sweet, sexy and seductive, All Lined Up is Cora Carmack in her best. A little bit of drama, lots of lots sexy and the couple worth swooning after, make it light, heart fluttering romance perfect in its own way. Fans of Carmack’s previous series will definitely be mesmerized by the first novel in A Rusk University Series and will quickly crave more.In light, completely enjoyable New Adult style, the author delivers heart racing, sexy college romance you won’t be able to say no to. I was rapidly thrown into this world full of sexy football players and I really, really liked it!Dallas is stuck in life where she’s constantly on the tongues of other people. Living under the shadow of her father and his job was always hard, but learning that she can’t even escape it and go to college somewhere else was even harder. As a daughter of football coach in Texas, Dallas was, let’s put it mildly, squished between football and even more football. 
  “In Texas, two things are cherished above all else—football and gossip. My life has always been ruled by both.”
Boys her age were only interested in getting into her father’s good graces or too afraid of him to make a move. And now, after her father got the position as a coach for Rusk’s football team, Dallas is back to square one , with her father as a shield and douche of an ex-boyfriend as the team’s QB. When she met Carson, a brilliant, handsome student she instantly felt at ease with him. For the first time, Dallas was so connected to the other person. But Carson is also a football player and is aspiring for the quarterback’s position, which is a BIG FAT NO in her book. She doesn’t do the same mistakes twice, does she?From the start to finish Dallas and Carson made me swoon, laugh and tingle. The chemistry between them was so vibrant and strong. They were perfect for each other, even when they tried to stay in the friend zone. Reading about them made me grin so hard! 
  “I don't know anything about this guy except that his eyes make my mind fuzzy and his muscled arms make my mouth water, and the things he keeps saying... they burn - beginning in my flushed cheeks, blazing through my blood, and curling between my legs until I feel like I have to squeeze them together just to keep from combusting on the spot."" 
What’s more, all this talking about sexy football players, preferably sweaty, sexy, naked football players was awesome! I literally know nothing about football but I want to learn now. All Lined Up is another very well done New Adult novel by Cora Carmack. She perfectly pictured romance, college, football, parties all that jazz. I can say she has an amazing talent to write in this genere. Overall, if you want crazy, sweet and sexy, first novel in Rusk University Series will give you exactly what you need. Be ready for some heart fluttering, swooning, laughing, and panty soaking. *Review Copy provided by publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for honest review * FOLLOW SMOKIN HOT BOOK BLOG ON: [""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",52,41
18505845,All Lined Up,Aj the Ravenous Reader,"1,005",1049,4,"April 13, 2018","Very well written and imaginatively descriptive. I like that the story is not only about romance even though it’s a new adult novel. I like how the plot emphasizes the individualities of the main characters and how they each perfect their crafts, Carson on football and Dallas on dancing. The way their individual interests is described and discussed is also very accurate. The author really does know a lot about football and dancing. Another good thing about the book is the honesty of both the major characters. I really liked that they were always upfront about their feelings for each other and therefore avoiding too much angst and drama. And even though there were a few graphic sexual scenes, they’re actually still quite artistic, admittedly hot (lol) and definitely not cringy. Except for the cheesy cover, it’s a recommendable NA read. ^^",47,7
18505845,All Lined Up,Lady Vigilante (Feifei),632,2657,5,"July 25, 2016","5 stars!!My expression while I was reading this book:Anyways, I. Loved. This. Book. Simply put, this story is just too cute, sweet, humorous, and sexy to resist – I never stood a chance! I do think I was in a really receptive mood for a “light & fun” read but then again, I’m a sucker for wit, dry humor, and anything that’s awkward and this book had all three. In my opinion, All Lined Up is Cora’s best work to date and a perfect example of what a good NA book should be so if you’ve been holding out on this genre, try this one out. Character descriptions:
  Dallas:
 The best quote from the book to describe her is:“In Texas, two things are cherished above all else – football and gossip. My life has always been ruled by both.”Because her Dad is the super well-known football coach at Rusk University, Dallas constantly lives in his shadow – football and gossip always associated to her name. Guys are either interested in her only to get to her Dad or too much of a chicken to make a move. As a result, she comes to loathes anything that has to do with football as all the sport has brought to her is a certain social stigma she can’t shake off. She’s never gotten the chance to prove to anyone she’s more than “Coach’s Daughter,” and she longs to fulfill her dreams as a dancer. 
  Carson:
 The best quote from the book to describe him is:“Growing up poor makes you hyperaware of all the other things people take for granted.”Carson is a newbie to Rusk University, having just transferred over. Having to work hard for everything he’s achieved thus far, he knows he can’t afford any distractions – including Dallas. This man, albeit a little bit of a klutz when it comes to academics, is one of the most patient, thoughtful, and charming heroes I’ve read about. A guy who’s actually NOT a manwhore in a NA setting – what a nice breath of fresh air from the usual Travis Maddox 2.0. And on top of which, he genuinely wants to know Dallas for the amazing girl she is, not because she’s a stepping stone to her Dad.To be honest, this book has some insta-love on Carson’s part but it didn’t bother me. Why? The way it happened was so funny and adorable, plus Carson’s the type of guy to see something/someone and know to appreciate, never taking anything for granted. In this case, he knows Dallas is important to him and whether as a friend or lover, he’s willing to take whatever she can give to him. His chemistry with Dallas is so palpable and the sexual tension is delectable! But most of all, they are honest to each other about everything – their feelings, their thoughts. They’re equals, best friends, lovers, and it just makes me so happy that I got to read a book where the two MCs don’t act like spoiled, jealous high school kids with a relationship ridden with communication gaps and character stupidity <--- you’d be surprised at how rare this is so seriously, I love your face Cora Carmack!This book sends out the most positive, uplifting message and not even a cynic could resist this heartwarming read. An absolute gem!This is a standalone - the next book focuses on an important side character. ARC provided by HarperCollins via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.

18505845,All Lined Up,Catarina,896,1930,4,"November 1, 2014"," 4 Lined Stars	Dallas was raised by a single father, who happened to be the school’s football coach. She never had a quite easy life as she always came second to football and all the guys who ever shown interest in her just wanted to fall in her father’s good graces through her. When she gets to college she hopes to finally be herself… except her father now decided to be a college coach and she still lives in his shadows.Enter Carson… he just wants a first place in the football team and works had for it. He doesn’t need distractions, especially if said distractions comes in the form of dating a girl he’s very attracted with. When Dallas found that he’s a part of the football team she doesn’t like… she had her share of guys trying to taking advantage because of that. Carson has a lot at stake and as much he likes Dallas he knows that their relationship could mean trouble. But as much as they try to get away from each other… they start to finding out that falling apart isn’t easy, when they both want so much to stay together.  Rating:  4 Stars.  Storyline:  For some reason, these days I tend to not read much NA. I don’t know why, I’m probably getting tired of it, and after delaying this reading for weeks now, I’m glad I did it. Yes, the plot is pretty much predictable and easy to guess, but it’s sweet, it’s realistic and it’s a pretty awesome reading for when you need your college love fix.  Character Development:  I liked how honest Dallas was and how she wasn’t afraid of speaking her mind. It’s refreshing to see that in a heroine. I also loved how sweet and loyal Carson was. And how he wasn’t a sexy-player-manwhore that we see too much on NA books. It was also refreshing and great to read.I’m really curious to read about Silas story.  Steam:  Some heated scenes.

It's hard not to compare this story to the other college quarterback books that I have read, but it this was nice, I guess.Dallas, a young dancer/coaches daughter is settling into her first year of college with her stereotypical best friend. She meets the second string quarterback, Carson. Carson is a farm boy who is looking for a scholarship and a permanent spot on the team. Her previous relationship was in high school, with the stereotypical jerk, Rusk University's current starting quarterback, Levi.Dallas doesn't want to get tangled with another of her father's players, she struggles to have her father see her dream of dancing and through it all their father/daughter relationship grows. 
  ""It's not easy coming second to a sport, Dad. You'll have to forgive me if i handled it badly sometimes.""
Carson and Dallas start off with a Romeo balcony scene (done so many times)and thereafter realize each others positions. The two decide on a friendship...eye roll because no one said they couldn't see each other. There's a lot of movie watching and leg touching till they both buck up and declare their feelings.
  ""You're it for me. So run if you'd like, but I'll follow. You can try to hold me at arm's length, but I'll never stop trying to pull you close.""

But I did like this one for what it was.....so not sure I should fault it for being more YA then I prefer. I just wasn't expecting that going in. And we all know...This book made me feel old. But the story was very sweet, the MCs were both great. There wasn't a bunch of juvenile drama and unnecessary angst. There was good banter amongst all of the characters. I think one of the things I liked about this one, was the football aspect. After all I'm from Texas and know a thing or two about high school and college football. Dallas grew up with football. Her dad was a high school coach and now coaches at the college Dallas attends. She doesn't date football players. Carson is trying to earn a scholarship and can't be distracted by a girl.Until she meets Carson. She doesn't know he's a football player at first....but then it's too late. Dallas and Carson spent a large part of the book going back and forth deciding whether they should or could like each other. They do eventually get things figured out...and we are finally rewarded with some action in the epilogue. So this slut did like this one, despite the lack of smut. I will consider reading the other books in the series. Just please make those less YA! ",37,22

Because I am rusty.”  All Lined Up is the story of Dallas, a dance major and Carson, a football player. Both meet at a college party, Dallas not knowing Carson is on the team, and Carson not knowing that Dallas is the daughter of his new football coach. They begin to spend time together, forming a friendship but holding romantic feelings for each other at the same time.   “I don't know that dancing fixes anything. I don't feel magically happy because of it. My problems don't disappear when the music ends. But I understand life better when I dance, and understanding is half the fight of surviving.”  Rusk University is a series I've been meaning to read, and now that three books are out I decided to dive in. Plus my local library has it, and who can deny a free book? This was more like a YA story than an NA one. Yes it was a little bit more racy than a YA book, but barely. I found I couldn't really relate to either of the characters in this book and maybe that's why I didn't love it. Regardless the story in this fell flat for me. I kind of liked it, but I wasn't invested in it, or in what would happen to the characters.

College is supposed to be a time to break free, to start fresh, but for Dallas is not. Everyone thinks being the football coach’s daughter is a benefit, but Dallas knows how things really are. Every football player is petrified of her father, so she doesn’t date football players. Dallas grow up only with her father, after her mother left when she was only a baby. She’s a good daughter and a great friend. She’s not very social, she prefers the company of books to people. Her dream is to be a dancer, but first she has to convince her father she’s a great dancer. Carson is a farm boy. He’s the new transferon Rusk University. His dream is to have a permanent spot on the team and a scholarship. Carson knows he’s not the greatest student, so his only chance to achieve his goals is to stay focused and to play very well.When Carson meets Dallas there’s some insta-attraction between them. Carson tries to stay away, especially when he finds out Dallas is couch’s daughter, but he can't because Dallas is like no other girl.
  
    “...for the first time in a long time, I don’t feel shackled to a plan or a problem. I only feel free. And I only feel her.”
  
They agree to stay only friends, but of course the start falling for each other. Staying friends is not an option anymore. “All Lined Up” was a sweet, adorable and almost fluffy story. It was an cute story and it really made me smile the entire time. Even if for me it was more a YA romance than a NA, I enjoyed it, but unfortunately it didn’t wow me. The storyline is predictable, with many clichés and some insta-love, but for some reason I wasn’t bothered. Maybe because it’s been so long since I read a college romance.I liked both Dallas and Carson. They are really great but at times they felt a little “too perfect”. I enjoyed how their relationship progressed and how they are with each other. There some sweet moments between them that make me swoon and I loved the chemistry and the sexual tension between them. The steam here is very low, which I admit I didn’t like too much. The angst is also very low and I liked there’s no misunderstanding between MC or some stupid drama. I liked they are honest with each other and they communicated from the beginning. They actually felt very mature. Overall, a nice enough college romance.  ",30,37

***Some spoilers for the sake of ranting.Where do I even start? I've enjoyed quite a lot of books with sports and romance mixed together, so I guess I did set the bar high for this book. And, clearly, it was a huge disappointment.All Lined Up took insta-lust, insta-attraction and insta-love to entirely new levels. Hell, Dallas and Carson kissed during their first meeting. Wonderful, isn't it? And yes, he did have his hand up her skirt that time! The I love yous came on pretty early as well, although it was mostly just implied. I couldn't get over how much they loved each other's smell--blegh.""I can smell him. Over the sticky September air, over the chlorine from the pool that is apartment overlooks, over everything.""Romance aside, I still can't find much to like about this book. Dallas acted like a whiny teenage girl, getting mad and upset of over the most shallow reasons. Another hot-and-cold character that didn't work out for me, sadly.Carson could've been an okay character, but unfortunately, Dallas had him wrapped up around her finger. He was way too enamored with her and I just couldn't understand why.The romance took over the whole story. There was lots of potential for lots of father/daughter love that wasn't fully explored. There were a couple of scenes where I loved Dallas' dad and their relationship, but it could've had a much bigger role in the story. Dallas and Carson also each had their own hobbies (dancing and football) that weren't given much of a spotlight.The writing wasn't for me, either. There was a lot more telling than showing--Carson and Dallas often had these completely random heart-to-heart talks where their dialogues were entire full-length paragraphs of their lives. Some words and phrases were repetitive, and while that might not bother some, it bothers me.So I don't know if I'll be trying out another Carmack book in the near future. Probably not.",28,12

Dallas is a dancer, and she wants nothing more then to leave Texas and go somewhere with a real dance program. Her father insist she stay in Texas and attend Rusk University, where he just accepted the head football coach position for the college. Carson McClain knows it won’t be easy, but he dedicated to succeeding in football. Raised on a ranch is family has struggled financially the last few years and he has a limited amount of time to prove himself. Going into Rusk his number one goal is to stay focused, the last thing he needs is a distraction. Dallas is exactly that, a distraction, but after one meeting he can’t stop thinking about the smarty, witty, beautiful girl he met. Dallas isn’t looking for a boyfriend, when she meets Carson but she finds it hard to resist him.So while Dallas is deciding if Carson is worth taking a chance on, Carson is debating if he can even be friends with her given that she his biggest distraction. Once Dallas discovers Carson is the second string quarterback her decision is made - no more football players. I love books set in college, add in a hot football player and I am sold. This is a fun read and is well written. I enjoyed the banter between Carson and Dallas, the sneaking around, and the angst. This story isn’t too steamy, but you really don’t miss it.

18505845,All Lined Up,♥Rachel♥,"1,800",828,3,"May 16, 2014","All Lined Up was a story of romance, football and growing up.Dallas Cole is starting her freshman year at Rusk University, a college in Texas, where her dad is the football coach, and her ex, Levi is the quarterback. Dating a football player didn’t work out so well so Dallas is determined to stay away from the players. Being the coach’s daughter underscores that decision, because the players either are scared to death of messing with her or they suck up to Dallas to get on her father’s good side. All her resolve is tested when she meets Carson.Carson is at Rusk hoping to earn a scholarship through football, something he’s naturally good at. He knows it’s an uphill battle so he’s determined to focus and work hard. His plans do not include girls or relationships, but meeting Dallas turns him upside down and he can’t stop thinking about her. Both Dallas and Carson weren’t planning on falling for someone, but sometimes the heart wants what the heart wants. Keeping their relationship in the friend zone is just too painful, and as Dallas and Carson come to realize, unnecessary. As their connection builds, Dallas deals with her strained relationship with her father. No parent/child relationship is perfect, and both Dallas and her father work at coming to terms with the past and future. Football and the life around it is a large part of this story and I enjoyed getting the feel of a place where the sport is a huge part of life. I’m not a sports person, but I do appreciate the fun way it molds people into a community cheering for the same thing. While I enjoyed All Lined Up I didn’t connect with the story as much as I hoped. All lot of the struggles and inner turmoil from Dallas didn’t move me, and I wish some of the passages were cut down. Still, romance between Carson and Dallas was pretty hot and I was happy there wasn’t a lot of angsty drama between them. This is a promising start to a fun series, and it sounds like resident playboy, Silas is up in the next story. A copy was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. ",19,21
