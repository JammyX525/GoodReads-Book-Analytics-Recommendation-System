Books in Cold Fury Hockey Series are stand-alones, but best enjoyed in order:Book 1: AlexBook 2: GarrettAlex (stand-alone, book 1) follows bad boy and star ice hockey player for the Carolina Cold Fury, Alexander Crossman, Alex aka MVP. Closed off to the world, he has settled into a life of one-night stands, playing hockey and playing it well while the fans hate him.

Alex’s reputation typically precedes him, but Sutton, however is not a hockey fan. At first, she cannot help but be in awe of his imposing presence and good looks. That is until Alex opens his mouth! Things go downhill from there…Alex is set on sex and seduction and Sutton on trying to keep things professional. Besides Alex does not do relationships. Story, told from dual POVs goes onto follow them working together while the sparks fly.

Eight words to describe Alexander Crossman, Alex: Despondent, angry, flawed, broken, conflicted, immature, caring and focused.
  
Eight words to describe Sutton Price: Sweet, unassuming, strong, smart, perceptive, nurturing, long-winded and fair.Alex picked up around 40% and kept me glued to the end. Other than Sutter feeling a little too perfect at times I thoroughly enjoyed their journey and where it left them. Up next is ladies’ man, Garrett Samuelson’s story,

21794306,Alex,Christy,"3,706",31500,4,"September 9, 2017","4 'MVP' stars!!!I’ve been told many times I need to read Sawyer Bennett, that I would love her stuff. Finally, I did it. Read my first book by this author. I have to say- I really enjoyed it. I’m not a sports fan. Not even a little… but for some reason, I like books about hockey players. There is just something about them. Alex is one of those guys thats a straight up bastard- and you know those are my favorite kind!!!Alex Crossman is good at hockey. No, he’s great at hockey. One of the best. The problem? He doesn’t give a shit about hockey. It’s just something he’s always been pressured to do his entire life. The pressure to be perfect makes him hate the game. His hockey team can tell he doesn’t care and coach is getting a lot of pressure for him to have a better attitude. Alex is mandated to help with a drug awareness program to give his image a makeover. That is where he meets Sutton.Sutton Price is the opposite of Alex. She’s a drug counselor, and even though her job is difficult, she loves it. Sutton hasn’t had the perfect life either, but she did not let it define her like Alex. She rose above it and is a wonderful person and role model. When she meets Alex, sparks fly. They get along better than expected. Alex likes that Sutton calls him out when he does something stupid. He likes that she's passionate about her job, that she cares about her kids and her family. He likes everything about her. Thats never happened to him before. Hockey is his only focus. Women are just there on the side. Sutton is different, and he wants to explore it.For the first time in his life, Alex is actually enjoying playing hockey, starting to care again. Sutton is the reason for that change. 
  ""...I like Sutton Price. I like her a lot and for probably a million other reasons. I probably like her most for the fact that she is getting me to re-evaluate the way I look at things.”
 It is so out of the norm for Alex, but he’s starting to care not only about hockey, but about Sutton too. The thing I love most about Sutton is that she doesn’t put Alex in this box of hockey player with an attitude. She shows him that he is the only person who can decide who he is. Not others. 
  
    “Don’t fall into the mold that people put you in. You are only what you want to be. If you want to be mean, be mean. If you want to be nice, be nice. But don’t do it because anyone expects it of you. Do it for yourself.”
  
Alex really cares for Sutton. Sutton is falling hard for Alex. Alex is conflicted. Things from his past that surface make him question if he can ever be in a relationship. He’s worried his demons will show and drive Sutton away. The last thing he wants to do is hurt her, but he can’t be away from her either. Alex could be a jerk, but he could also be a really great guy. I loved seeing how much he grew in this story. He was a jerk in the beginning, but turned out to be really sweet and swoony by the end. Sutton was a fabulous heroine. She was kind, understanding and sweet. Almost seemed too perfect at times, but regardless- I really liked her. Another character I really loved was Garrett. I’m hoping he gets his own story down the line! The ending was perfection. Hockey rink and cards- I loved it! Then the very end… the sweetest! This was an easy read for the most part. There were some emotional moments, but it was a lot of sweet and sexy too.Getting both Alex and Sutton’s pov really helped with seeing Alex’s struggles and growth. I enjoyed this authors writing style. I’m looking forward to reading more of her hockey boys! 
  She is the most important person in my life and always will be because she showed me that life is about overcoming struggles and opening yourself up to possibility.

  ""The contact is so explosive, so richly captivating, that I immediately feel like I'm drowning in a sea of desire.""
At the risk of sounding like I'm repeating myself, once again I have to express the fact that nothing attracts me more to a book than the words 'sports related and romance' in the same sentence. Sawyer Bennett blew me away with her romantic story telling and I can tell you right from the start that although the cover to this book is delicious all by itself it does not give what's inside justice. If you are expecting an easy going romance with all the usual ingredients for a book in this genre then you'll be pleasantly surprised because not only do you get all of the above but you get a whole lot more. Bennett has packed her pages full of heart felt sentiments and a journey of two characters that completely stole my attention. 'Alex' is a gorgeously written tale of healing, love and fulfilment and I for one am fully convinced by this authors talent. What's it all about?Alex Crossman is a NHL superstar with an attitude as big as his talent. Winning hockey games has never been his problem but fighting his past so that it doesn't affect his future is becoming a living nightmare. Following the demands of his management team Alex must start to change his public image and make some drastic changes. When Sutton price first meets the famous hockey star she finds herself attracted to this difficult man with more secrets than she is able to unravel, but as this duo start to work together the attraction is undeniable and they soon start to feel more for each other than they both dare to admit. But sadly when broken pasts and an unwillingness to love gets in the way of a happy ending they both have to make the decision to fight for what they love.What did I love?Determination, courage, love and full of heart this book made my reading time a pleasure. 'Alex' was a superb love story that had plenty of depth and emotion attached to it. One of things I appreciated most about this authors story telling and what stood out to me most was that the author didn't add any additional, unnecessary drama to sensationalise the story telling instead Bennett has created a story line that turned out to be a fantastic page turner and fabulous love story. As for the characters, they also thoroughly impressed me. I have no qualms about admitting that a hero with a moody, brooding self confessed prick persona is always going to be winning brownie points in my camp. I love that 'love to hate' you feeling and this author has captured that perfectly in this book. Alex Crossman has more than his fair share of demons to fight, and I enjoy nothing more than a tortured hero who discovers he may be falling in love. The heroine was perfectly relatable she had her insecurities without ever being overbearing or irritating in fact she was the star of the show as she showed her strength through her difficulties. Everything from the hockey playing to the passion and heartache was played out so well there was little to find fault about. If you like to read about affairs of the heart that have a great plot to go alongside it then you won't go far wrong picking up this book. And as always when I read a book as good a this one I'm now going on the hunt for books that are similar. Sawyer Bennett has well and truly earned my attention and I can happily add this couple to one of my favourites.Why not five?I battled a little with myself over the rating of this book. There is undeniably no question as to whether I loved this book or not and I'm sure I'll not be for forgetting this authors name for future releases. However (it's a small however) there were times when the story slowed down somewhat and I felt a lull in the plot progress that made consider the full five star rating. But make no mistake I enjoyed the journey from chapter one until the end and I was a little forlorn to say goodbye to the two characters that I had most certainly grown to love.Final thoughts ...I'm not sure what this author plans on working on next but I have no shame in admitting that I will beg, plead and stalk Mrs Bennett for a book to be written about Garrett. As a secondary character in this book he stole just a little of the limelight and I'm now desperately in need for that hero to find his own happy ending. As for 'Alex' this will be a novel that I have no doubts about revisiting. Sexy, heartwarming, romantic and completely read worthy this book had me from the moment I picked it up right up until the end. If you love the books you read to include a charming heroine with plenty of heart and a hero that gets your heart pounding then this story will be a treat for you. I'm still thinking on this story days after finishing it and I'm hoping other readers will love it just as much as I did. Readers don't miss out on meeting Alex Crossman he's a hero I'm sure you'll love to hate and by the end I can guarantee he will have won you over. Enjoy, kisses.

    5 honest stars...painfully so
  
I love reading sport themed books, especially about hockey. I'm a proud puck lover:) And I really enjoyed reading this one. There was not unnecessary drama, there were hot steamy sex scenes and finally there were wonderful charachters. Alex, named MVP - Most Valuable Prick, is an incredible hockey player, too bad he doesn't give a shit about a game, his team and fans. To fix his and team's reputation, Cold Fury's management sends him to participate in a drug awareness program. That is where he meets Sutton, a drug counsellor he is supposed to cooperate with. What they both have in common, is their rough past, the difference is she moved on and is doing well, while he still lets the past rule his present. They can't deny mutual attraction and slowly their professional relationship turns into something more. There was a slight slip-up on Alex's part along the way, but nothing major, not the drama I couldn't deal with and enough grovelling made me forgive him fast (and yes it was soooo grovelling). Also, believe me when I say that Alex is sex on skates! That man is hawt and lickable, not kidding! Just imagine those ice hockey bodies and you'll get the picture:) A little example maybe?  Sawyer Bennett has an incredible talent of creating asshole heroes, that I fall for, and this one was no exception. Alex is mean and bitter, he has no friends or social life, always sarcastic and cocky bastard you would say, but he is not that man when it comes to Sutton. He is caring and attentive, she seems to know how to bring the best part of him to the surface.
  ""You know you're extremely beautiful, but when you laugh you're just stunning.""""She brought color into my gray existence, and for that I owe her everything.""
I also liked that Sutton didn't steal the show here, the title is ""Alex"" and it was a book about Alex, though she played an important part of the story. With her help, he slowly changed from unlikable person to friendly team-mate, loving boyfriend and good role model for his young fans.Aww, and I loved the ending and epilogue. Using the motive from ""Love actually"" was a brilliant idea. It was sweet and heart-warming. Ok, I saw this gif in other reviews, but it is just asking to put it here, I can't help myself using it too, sorry girls;)We also got to meet Garret (Smart. Mother. Fucker.), Alex's team mate, who is womanizer, but the one that is respectful to women he ""has fun with"" and I can't wait to see him being struck by cupid's arrow.Oh, one more thing, I almost forgot, total cover lust !!! I hope Garrett's book will have as hot cover as this one, seriously drooling here;)

21794306,Alex,Lady Vigilante (Feifei),632,2657,3,"August 14, 2016","3 stars!After reading two very intense and powerfully gripping books, I turned to this book as it seemed like a light and straight-forward read, something I was in the mood for. I guess I shouldn’t judge a book by its hot cover because it wasn’t just all fun and steamy. Behind Alex’s cold indifference and Sutton’s bubbly enthusiasm lie issues that are common in many households: abuse and alcoholism. I deeply admire the author for tackling both of these tough subjects in this book and giving these characters, albeit fictional, hope that no matter how harsh their past, no one has control over their present and future. It is a beautiful message. However, there are a few things I wasn’t too fond of that were present in this book and kept me from fully enjoying it.1. Alex’s hot-and-cold behaviorWhen I first got a glimpse of Alex’s childhood, I wanted to hug the man. I also understood his loathing for hockey, his father, and relationships in general. Yet it still doesn’t give him a reason to treat others – and especially Sutton – like trash just because he’s in a shitty mood. My biggest complaint would be his momentary lapse in judgment near the end of the book: WORST. DECISION. EVER. This part was annoying because I felt like it was completely unnecessary – I mean if Alex is going to break up with Sutton only to get back with her soon after at least make the reason good. Oh and this:
  “Garrett told me that I wouldn’t have to grovel.”
What an unnecessary breakup. What a waste of book page space. 2. Sutton letting everyone roll over her like she’s doughWhat is her middle name, doormat? Don’t get me wrong, she’s a good woman but at the same time she was so…obtuse.Old boyfriend breaks up with her for lousy reasons and crushes her heart? ...oh whatever.Alex is an ass to her? ...Forgives him.Other people piss her off? ...*shrugs*Quite frankly, I think it’s just eerie that someone like Sutton exists. Call me cynical or whatever…but I’m going to quote from another book that explains what I think of her: 
  “I think there’s something seriously wrong with anyone who isn’t at least a little let down by the world.”
 - How To Kill A Rock Star*********************Additionally, the wrap-up of all the loose ends in this book (Alex’s dad, Sutton’s ex, etc…) was just too perfect and all jammed together I felt like the author was rushing to give them an HEA. However, she does have a very simple yet addictive writing style that I liked and the ending was sweet but it wasn’t enough because I didn’t really love any of the characters. All in all, an easily forgettable story that provided temporary enjoyment.

21794306,Alex,Jx PinkLady Reviews ♡ bookwormthoughts,725,1003,4,"October 20, 2014","4.5 Stars  It's LIVESutton Price works as a counsellor at a crisis centre. She’s there for the kids and is passionate about making a difference in their lives. Sutton herself has experienced and overcome a great deal of difficulty, giving her wonderful inner strength and a quiet, all knowing confidence that's contagious. Sutton is both endearing and inspiring. Twenty-six year old Alex is our HOT Hockey playing hero and the MVP of the team. “Most valuable prick.” He’s a complete asshole to everyone, fans and team mates alike, but he's also their superstar gifted player so he gets away with it, until now..... Now, he's been ordered to improve his reputation by working on a project with Sutton. Sutton knows nothing about Hockey so she's not overwhelmed in anyway by his persona. Something about Sutton, her honesty, her care, her attitude towards life inspires Alex to think and feel differently about everything, including the game of Hockey. They change things for each other in a beautiful, inspiring way. They have gorgeous chemistry. Sutton aims to keep things as business only and he doesn't 'do' relationships of any kind but they have a strong pull to one another, an undeniable attraction both physically and mentally. Alex is closed off emotionally but, as in all good romances, the love and care of a wonderful heroine is a balm to his wounds. The way he responds to her is blissfully mixed with a dash of angst. I felt his presence and charisma and their first time together is... WOW... magnificently hot! In fact the story is a whole load of yumminess!Things hang in the balance….. Alex has the power to screw things up or let himself feel. He’s burdened by the weight of his past and present. One small thing, I wish we’d seen the action of their break up… but  equally I like that this author approached it in a slightly different manner than one would expect. I found myself smiling my way through the read and feeling the warm fuzzies, it appealed to my romantic side in a big way. Alex is perfectly paced and lightly angsty which is perfect for the story presented. I loved the narrative of the heroine, her inner voice is effortless on the mind and Alex is just dreamy, I loved being inside his brooding head. I felt a wonderful subtlety to the writing, there are no over dramatics which I greatly appreciated. This is one of those stories that I picked up with little expectation. I’ve never read a book by this author and I’m not a Hockey fan, partly due to the fact that it’s not a big sport in the UK. I have to say after reading ALEX, I wish it was. Alex has made me want to soak up the experience of an Ice Hockey match, preferably with him in it!

  ""No story. Love playing hockey, love fucking women, love spending my money. I'm a pretty simple guy.""
 Alex is the first book in the Cold Fury Hockey Series. Each book can be read as a stand-alone. If you are a fan of hockey romance, this series is one blockbuster hit you do not want to miss. Alex is the bad boy of hockey. Although he is a superstar on the ice, he is quite the player with the women. Due to his bad image, Alex is forced to make some changes if he wants to keep his career on the right path. When the team management sends him to complete some outreach for the team, Alex meets Sutton. Sutton is a social worker who is working in a drug abuse center. Alex is completely taken with Sutton and despite his fears of connecting with someone on a deeply intimate level, he finds something in Sutton that he wants to have. Alex and Sutton have much to overcome with the pressures of being in the spotlight and yet, the passion and friendship that blooms between them cannot be denied.
  ""The contact is so explosive, so richly captivating, that I immediately feel like I'm drowning in a sea of desire.""
Told in dual POV, Alex is an absolutely stunning hockey romance full of action, passion, and tender romance. The characters are complex as both have had to overcome a tremendous amount of adversity. I really enjoyed the connection between Alex and Sutton and how they discovered peace amidst all of the chaos around them. I thoroughly enjoy the Cold Fury Hockey action and I felt like this first book offers a perfect blend of both hockey action and smoking hot passion. In addition to my Kindle almost catching on fire, I found there to be great depth in the plot and the way in which the characters relate to one another.
  ""I know I'm probably still destined to screw things up with Sutton but I've decided, until then, my soul is her bitch.""
Overall, I recently discovered this series and all I can say is where have I been? It is official, I am now a complete Cold Fury addict and I cannot wait to meet every single player of the Cold Fury Hockey Team! Hockey romance fans absolutely must check this series out. ***Cold Fury Hockey***For more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit: ",59,31

This was my first time reading a book written by Sawyer Bennett, and I can honestly say that I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series, plus all over her other works!! I've read one other book about a sexy Hockey player, and after having read ""ALEX"", I think I'm going to make it my mission to read more of these types of stories!! WOW!!!
  
Alex Crossman plays for North Carolina's NHL team the Cold Fury. He's the designated bad boy of the team. Definitely the best player, but has an attitude that rubs his fellow team mates, managers, and fans the wrong way. Alex usually scores the most goals in every game, which deems him the ""MVP"", but fans give him the nickname, Most Valuable Prick. He's a professional hockey player, who hates the game itself. This is due to having an abusive father who pushed him beyond his limits to be the best at the sport.
  
The team's management is looking to improve Alex's reputation. He's told he must act as the Cold Fury's spokesman for an anti-drug abuse campaign. He will be working closely with a counselor at the local Drug Crisis Center. Alex is a bit ticked off by being forced into this community service but it's either comply or kiss his career goodbye.Sutton Price is a counselor at the Wake County Drug Crisis Center. She's very passionate about her job and excited about her project to start up a new program to help at-risk youth throughout the state. She knows she will be working closely with Alex on the project but since she's not a hockey fan, she knows nothing about him.As soon as they meet there's an instant attraction. Sutton tries to fight it as she thinks it would be unprofessional to get involved with each other. Alex has never had any deep feelings for a woman before. He tends to stick to women who offer up casual sex.Alex and Sutton will not fight their feelings for each other for too long. The sex scenes were insanely hot! But there was more to their relationship than the amazing sex, they seemed to be a perfect fit and Sutton actually brings light back into Alex' life. He comes out of his protective shell and begins to socialize with his team mates. He even begins to find the passion that he had lost for Hockey.Something has to come along and cause drama for the couple and it will be Alex's old demons from the past. I was not a fan of how he handled things with Sutton, but I give her credit for not taking any of his crap and letting him know just what a douche he was being.She's precariously close to becoming my everything, a thought that scares the daylights out of me. I'm not sure I'm ready for that responsibility, particularly not when I have so many ghosts that continue to torture me.This story had several secondary characters that I loved, but my favorite was Garrett, a fellow team mate of Alex's. I'm anxious to read his book!I loved how he helps Alex towards the end and I have to just say that the Epilogue was PERFECT!! I definitely recommend this one. It had a deliciously hot book boyfriend, awesome heroine, and the book was all around an enjoyable read.",57,55

The MVP (Most Valuable Player Prick), Alex, is not a well-liked player or person. He may be Mr. Hockey Hottie but he's not winning points with fans or teammates. His attitude stems from his childhood with a drunk father. This lack of love for the game and his poor attitude has his coach wanting him to clean up his act. Forced to work on a project to better his image he's assigned to work with social worker, Sutton, on a drug/alcohol campaign to help the youth in the community. At the beginning of the book I had a few moments where I felt like Sutton wasn't a 22 year old but rather a 40 year old divorcee (drinking wine alone in the house she owns...all she was missing was a cat or two). 
""Seems some hot hockey player has my attention now."" -Sutton""Yeah? That's ironic, because I'm sort of lusting after this hot drug counselor I met."" -Alex""Sounds like a match made in heaven."" -SuttonI loved the ""Love Actually"" movie moment in the hockey rink.

I can't say this one was wowing or anything out of the box but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Neither of the main charactes were annoying and stupid....there wasn't a bunch of dumb drama....and there was some good steam.Alex Crossman is a star hockey player in the NHL. He's the MVP of hockey....the Most Valuable Prick. He's an asshole. An asshole who has let his past dictate his future. Sutton Price is a counselor for a drug crisis center. She hasn't let her past dictate her future. She's risen above her past and found a way to help others. In an effort to improve Alex's image, he's been enlisted to work with Sutton on an anti-drug abuse campaign. 
  
    ""...I like Sutton Price. I like her a lot and for probably a million other reasons. I probably like her most for the fact that she is getting me to re-evaluate the way I look at things.""
  
There's just something about Sutton. Maybe because they come from similar backgrounds. But Alex finds himself starting to actually like hockey again. Starting to smile again, laugh again. But his past is always there in the background threatening to pull him back under.I really liked Sutton and Alex together. They were sweet together, they were hot together. Alex may have started out as an asshole, but Sutton brought out the best in him. 
  
    ""She makes me uncomfortable....the clarity with which she seems to see me. She makes me curious as to what else she might see.She makes me want....something, but I'm not sure what.""
  
I loved that there wasn't a bunch of drama and angst. Just one minor ""thing"" that was resolved pretty quickly. And I loved the resolution. The epilogue also made me tear up a bit too! So sweet!Great start to the series. I hope the next book is about Garrett!

21794306,Alex,Beverly,"1,005",801,4,"October 14, 2014","LIVE http://www.amazon.com/Alex-Cold-Hocke... 4 Most Valuable Prick StarsAlexander Crosssman is the Most Valuable Player for the Cold Fury, but he is also the biggest Prick in the league. While this persona would bother most, Alex relishes it. He hates the game and everything it involves, he would quit tomorrow if had another plan, but he doesn’t. He is stuck and being stuck makes him hate it even more. That is until the owner threatens to begin fining him if he doesn’t shape up. As a part of revamping his image, Alex has to work with a counselor at the local drug crisis center to develop a campaign to help the youth in the county. This is where he meets Sutton. Sutton had a difficult life growing up, her father was an addict and her mother worked nonstop to provide for them. Sutton refuses to let her past define her, instead she focuses on what she does have: an awesome stepfather, a mother who loves her, a little brother with a heart of gold, great friends, and job where she is making a difference. Alex and Sutton both had a hellacious past, and while Sutton has moved on, Alex is still very much living in his hell. Alex and Sutton begin spending time together, dating and he can see himself changing. Sutton is bringing back his love for the game and completely changing his life. I really enjoyed this one. The story moved pretty quickly. I love an asshole and Alex definitely had that role down, but throughout the story he grew and realized what he wanted, on and off the ice. Sutton was honest, loving, and understanding. I actually wish she had been a little less understanding, there were times when I wanted her to get mad, scream, fight - anything! But she didn’t, because it isn’t true to her character - just mine. LOLThere were parts that were a little cheesy to me, but overall I really enjoyed and would recommend to someone looking for a quick, sexy read with minimal drama.

    “Seems some hot hockey player has my attention now.”“Yeah? That's ironic, because I'm sort of lusting after this hot drug counselor I met.”“Sounds like a match made in heaven.”
  
Alex was my very first read by Sawyer Bennett and while I enjoyed this story quite a lot it wasn't something that blew me away. But please don't let that keep you from reading this one, it's just a classic case of it's me not you. I've read a few very emotionally charged and demanding books over the last few weeks and poor Alex, although he is such a loveable most valuable prick, paled in comparison.
  
    “The more I'm getting to know Alex Crossman, the more I am definitely not liking him.”
  
Alexander Crossman is a brilliant hockey player with an attitude and public image problem. If it wasn't for his mad skills on the ice he would have been thrown out of the NHL a long time ago. Ever met a professional player who doesn't love the game? Well, here is one.Alex's bad behaviour and general indifference toward his team and the fans forces the management to take drastic turns. He gets a very special assignment/punishment. Work on a drug-abuse awareness program for at-risk youth for one year. What he doesn't expect is his fiery new partner.
  
    “This is essentially my jailer for the next year, which also makes her my enemy.And I can't fuck the enemy.At least I don't think I can.”
  
Sutton Price is a twenty-two year old drug counsellor. She is for all intends and purposes the polar opposite from Alex. She is a good and caring person with big heart, has a deep love for her work and the golden touch with people in general.I really loved their first meeting. Sutton has a little jaw on the floor situation and Alex with no shame whatsoever asks her out right away. Yeah, inst-lust alert! And then they find out who they really are and what they have to do with each other. Lucky for Alex, Sutton is someone who has the ability to ignore all of his bullshit, get under his skin and bring down some walls. In the end both have a lot more in common than they might think.
  
    ���I lucked out when I met you.”
  
Despite his less than favourable behaviour, Alex is actually a very lovable character and thanks to the double POV I never, not for one second, didn't like him. Just like Sutton, who is a really likeable heroine without any annoying traits or quirks. I'm only giving Alex 3.5 stars because of the book's mellow nature, the inst-lust and the fact that they take a lot of time to get down and dirty. But once they do...oh wow. They do it all the time. Which actually got a bit repetitive as well. *shrugs* All in all a satisfying read with two really well developed character, wonderful side characters. Especially Sutton's family was so sweet and caring, you just want to have dinner with them and then cuddle Glenn. What a sweet child. Oh, and I can't finish this review without mentioning Garrett...lucky for us the next book in the series is about him. I for one can't wait. ;DShort but sweet review, I hope that's ok. Thank you for your time. ;D**ARC kindly provided by the publisher via Net-Galley in exchange for an honest review.

21794306,Alex,Geri Reads,"1,232",2023,3,"October 14, 2014","3.5 stars!I would have rated it higher had Alex's sudden change of heart been convincing, but it was too unbelievable. I would've let it go but I found myself getting bored halfway through the book, which doesn't bode well for me. But mostly, it was just the way Alex suddenly turned from most valuable prick to saint in an instant. I didn't mind that he changed because he met the right girl but his transformation from being a heartless bastard to sensitive guy just didn't sound convincing to me. It was totally unbelievable that he changed that fast and that drastically. He doesn't care about his teammates before but after he got together with Sutton, he's all lovey-dovey with his team mates? Despite that, there's still a lot of things I enjoyed. I liked Sutton and her family. Garrett was fun, too. I liked that the author showed both Alex's professional job as well as Sutton. She could have gone all hockey and neglect Sutton's career but she didn't, and I liked that. I also liked Alex's gesture at the end although I disagree with Sutton about the groveling part. I would have loved to see more groveling from Alex. But hey, Sutton said she's okay with it, so I guess that makes it okay then...I could hardly argue with a fictional character's decision regarding her love life now, could I? Yup. Thought so.

Alexander Crossman aka Alex/Most Valuable Prick is a 26 yr. old professional hockey player for the Carolina Cold Fury in Raleigh, North Carolina. He is their star player, but also the player everyone loves to hate. He is the teams bad boy with an attitude problem. He is a phenomenal player with so much talent & ability, but he doesn't care about the game and just does enough to get by.
  
After being with the Fury for almost 6 years, Alex wasn't happy, & still hated the sport. This was a result of his daddy issues. He had an abusive, overbearing father who only cared about making his son into a hockey star. He was deprived of a normal childhood, & never shown love. As a result he is a damaged adult that is detached from his emotions, who has never been in a relationship.
  
Because of his poor attitude the hockey league decides he needs to clean up his image. They want him to be the team spokesman for an anti-drug abuse campaign. He is sent to the Wake County Drug Crisis Center to meet with the counselor he will be working closely with. Her name is Sutton Price. He meets her and is shocked by his intense attraction to her. He feels an instant connection and chemistry that he hasn't ever experienced.
  
As they spend time together working on the outreach program they really enjoy each others company, & find they have a lot in common. Their friendship eventually turns intimate as they are seduced by one another. Alex is absolutely captivated by her, and scared of how strongly he feels for her. She's been this beautiful bright spot since she came into his life, but he's afraid to let her too close.
  
Eventually after some drama, Alex learns not to let his past or his pain control him. Sutton understands him & makes him re-evaluate the way he looks at things. She becomes his everything & helps him heal & feel deserving of love. This was my first book by this author & I loved it! I'm now dying for more of these hot hockey players & can't wait for Garrett's book! :D
  
-""You know you're extremely beautiful, but when you laugh you're just stunning.""-""Sutton... I don't know what this is... between us. But I know it's something. I know it's pulling me, and trust me when I tell you... nothing has pulled at me in a long time.""
  
-""You reached me. When no one else ever has.""-I'll fight hard for you.
  
-She fascinates me like no other person I've met, and that scares me just a bit. It excites me too.-You are the most important thing in the world to me.",33,10
21794306,Alex,Dilek VT,"1,529",1340,3,"March 23, 2018","2,5 starsThis book is the first one of the “Cold Fury Hockey” series. The hero Alex is the star player of his team but he is known for his as*hole behavior. He is cold and distant and sometimes even rude to his team players and fans. The way he treats women is unbearably gross.Now Alex needs to fix his public image through community service (a drug-abuse awareness program for at-risk youth) or the other option is to ride the bench. When he meets the social worker, Sutton Price, who is going to assist him for this community service, there is instant attraction between them. ***********************************************The backgrounds of Alex and Sutton are similar. She was abused in the hands of a drug addict father and he was abused by his alcoholic father. However, Sutton has built up a new life that she can find happiness in whereas Alex hates his life and cannot still cope with his past. His surly behavior today toward everyone stems from his unhappy and stolen childhood and his inability to make peace with it.***********************************************These two characters bond very quickly and they have a strong chemistry between them. Sutton is a wonderful heroine that is impossible to love. I liked her really a lot. Their relationship gets better and better but Alex never lets her in completely. He doesn't want anyone's pity. He is also always pessimistic about their future. He believes they won't last. He believes he will hurt her. He cannot think positively no matter what. Still, he wants to be with her as long as it lasts. Because he doesn't let her in completely, their relationship is mostly physical, which bothered me a bit.***********************************************Once or twice there is an OW & OM drama caused by Sutton's ex-boyfriend and Alex's ex hookup but both of them handle those events in the best way possible not to upset each other and it doesn't affect their relationship. On the contrary, it seems to strengthen it until Alex ruins it all by himself.***********************************************My problems with the book:Nothing much happens for a long while really. It is quite an uneventful book. That's why, it feels slow and dragging.***********************************************I cannot forgive the hero!Sadly, towards the end, there are the daddy issues arising on both sides. Sutton handles it very well but Alex fails to do so. From then on, it goes worse and worse. At one point, Alex pushes Sutton away and breaks her heart. He cannot concentrate on his game and he thinks Sutton is a distraction from his game and as a solution, he breaks up with her. However, she was never a distraction but a positive effect on his life. The distraction was his father and his issues with him. Alex understands the mistake he has done but he does nothing to fix it until his close friend Garrett encourages him to do so.Well I must accept that there is good groveling and a happy end but I have never forgiven Alex for hurting Sutton and disposing her so easily. And I was a bit pissed at Sutton for taking him back so easily even if his gesture was lovely and big.All in all, this is not a bad book but it wasn't one that evolved the way I would prefer it did.***********************************************Thinking that each book will drag like the first one did, or fearing that one of the characters will piss me off again as much as Alex did, I am reluctant to continue the series.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",30,10
