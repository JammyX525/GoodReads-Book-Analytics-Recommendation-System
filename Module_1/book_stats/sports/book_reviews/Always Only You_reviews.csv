    Yes I have a tender spot for the six-foot-three cinnamon roll.
  
Give me ALLLLL the slow-burn sports romances with cinnamon roll heroes. ALL OF THEM! I enjoyed the first book in this series, but I was not expecting to love this book so hard. I did. I fell hard for Ren and Frankie and their love story. Ren is a professional hockey player but he’s so much more than that. He comes from a big family and he’s a great son and brother. He’s also a lover of Shakespeare, a bit of a nerd, and not afraid to show his emotions. I’ll probably gush over him a lot in this review because he might just be the best hero I’ve read in 2020. And he’s got it bad for the social media marketer for his team, Frankie. He’s had it bad for her for years and he’s *swoon* waited for her all this time. Frankie is a bit of a bad ass. She’s strong, amazing, and is a grumpy girl (according to her) but who could blame her? She suffers from the chronic pain of RA. On top of that, she’s also autistic. She’s been diagnosed with both for some time and does a good job managing them, but sometimes can come off a bit harder than she means to and doesn’t always get certain peoples hits or social cues.I could not have loved this couple and their romance more. Seriously, there isn’t anything I didn’t love about this one. It was just so great. And listen guys, the older I get the less I want to read about a super alpha hero and the more I want to read about a soft hero. Ren was so so soft and sweet and I loved how the grumpy/sweet troupe was role reversed in this one because Frankie is a self proclaimed grump. Ren never sees her that way, though, and that is one of the things I loved best about this one. Always Only You is for sure going on my top reads of 2020 list. It was endearing, sweet, steamy, and so beautiful. I loved that this author always seems to give us diverse characters, for this one it’s RA and autism (own voices). Great representation and a fantastic read I’d recommend to all who love slow burn romances, sports romances, and sweet and soft heroes. I’m so ready to read more from this series!

Now how am I supposed to keep my love life expectations realistic? Ren is freakin amazing! Everyone needs a Ren in their life. Personally, I won’t settle for less! Now when I say that I have a huge crush on Ren, I’m not exaggerating. When he smiles I found myself smiling. When he blushes, I blush. When he laughs, I start to giggle like I teenager. When he talks, I swoon and I’m not even ashamed to admit all of that! I loved Frankie so much as well. She was such a perfect heroine. I just love a grumpy not so grumpy heroine so freakin much. The representation of her character was done so well. I was rooting for these two from the very beginning like I knew them personally and desperately want them to be together. And how Ren loves Shakespeare? and he even swear in Shakespearean style? I felt like my heart won’t be able to take it anymore. Chloe’s writing is just so beautiful and addictive. I was so emotionally overwhelmed by this book. I was so freakin happy reading it that I wanted to cry! Special thanks to NetGalley for providing this copy.",197,35

My husband thought I was choking ( sometimes my laugh resembles crow choir which sign a acapella) and performed Heimlich maneuver ( I wish he could be more careful when he lifted me up and didn’t hurt his back. Now he’s walking like Quasimodo at house, ringing neighbors’ bells as a prank!) Let’s go back to reviewing and telling you how much I’m delightful for finally reading this sequel because since I’ve read Willa and Ryder’s story, I was so curious about Ren and I’m so happy he finally had his own book. Every time his character appears on the pages, Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t stop the feeling” starts to play in my head. He’s my cinnamon dolce latte! He’s magical rainbow appears in the sky as the rain stops, marshmallow on my hot cacao and sunshine brightening my day! From the beginning he was so adorable character. But I have to admit: at some parts of the book I adored our heroine more. Yes, I’m talking about our grumpy heroine Frankie. The author created so realistic, genuine and relatable characters who seem like your real life friends. The representation of Autism via Frankie and her challenges, issues with adjusting daily life, connecting with social life, doing her job and the other people’s reactions and approaches to her illness were impressively real, well-told. She also suffers from rheumatoid arthritis which is an invisible chronic illness. Both characters are well developed, emotionally layered and their slow burn, forbidden love story was incredibly sweet, poignant and entertaining. You feel like teenager again as you read their sizzling chemistry. You get excited, your heart rate increases, intact your heart begins to dance and sing: “I got sunshine in my pocket, got the good soul in my feet”Yes, more five blazing, lovely, swoon, sweet, sunshine stars are coming up!

54125750,Always Only You,Warda,"1,088",17400,5,"June 2, 2022","4.5 Shakespearean Stars! ✨ Chloe Liese has done it again with this incredible, own-voices story about an autistic woman with rheumatoid arthritis, hell-bent on living life according to her terms and not letting anything hold her back or limit her. I don’t know what to say that hasn’t already been said about Frankie and Ren’s story. It was disgustingly adorable and tender.I wasn’t sure how I was going to feel about this since the first 100 pages did not work for me. For reasons that probably have nothing to do with the book, but me. And sure enough, as I read on, I latched on and didn’t want to let go. Chloe Liese is such a game-changer for the romance genre. Her stories are heartfelt, honest, funny and educational. I respect that she looks to educate others and herself and write about it within a genre that isn’t always positively received. Her writing conveys everything her characters want to portray and as the reader, you are right there with them on their journey. My heart was so full! I can’t wait to read the next book. I don’t want this series to end! I’m gonna need everyone to have their own book. Ziggy and Rooney, especially.",154,32

He's been in love with Frankie Zerferino, his team's social media manager for years, but can't act on it because they work together.Frankie, a tough, no-nonsense woman, with Autism and RA, keeps her Autism, and her soft marshmallow heart a secret, and doesn't let anyone close. Ren and Frankie develop a strong friendship, but;Will Ren finally tell Frankie how he feels?Can Frankie open her heart?OMG I devoured this precious love story, and I loved these two!! I really cared about them both, and really enjoyed following their journey! Ren was just adorkable! Sweet, patient, gentle and understanding, he wasn't your usual stereotype of a hockey star. And the way he pined for Frankie!I just adored Frankie!! She was such a well written character, authentically written by an own voices author with a lot of talent. Frankie was so brave, strong and determined, and it was eye opening seeing her daily struggles in terms of both her Autism, and with her chronic illness. This is the second book I have read this year, that featured a character with RA, and the way both characters dealt with their hidden disability just awed me. Chloe Liese always excels at writing diverse characters, and has fantastic representation in all of her romance books, but she really nailed it here. Chloe's own experiences shone through, giving Frankie's character a lot of depth. There was also a look at mental health, and both characters' vulnerability. I just loved that beneath Frankie's grumpy façade, lay a woman with a heart of gold!Frankie and 'Zenzero' had amazing chemistry, and some of their scenes were hawwwwt! I loved their banter and their slow burn, friends to lovers romance, which was sexy and sweet, and made me both swoon and smile! Most of all, I loved the friendship that they built up together!I also loved all the other friendships, from Frankie and Willa, to Frankie's supportive friends Annie and LO. Additionally, Frankie and Ziggy's relationship made me tear up several times! Ren's teammates were (mostly) a joy, and I loved his Shakespeare group! As for family.. how can I hang out with the Bergman family?!! Either in their A-frame, or the parents' house, I just want to be part of it!!! 🤣 Although this was a romance book, it was also so much more. Chloe Liese wrote this emotional story beautifully. By the time I had finished, my heart was so full and I had dried tears on my smiling face! And then she had the audacity to hit me with that author's note!!I would definitely recommend this series, and can't wait to read the book about Freya and Aidan! And was that a sneaky nod to another possible match with Rooney and Axel?!!Available everywhere from today (August 4th 2020).Many thanks to the author for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review! Thank you so much Chloe! 🙌------------------------------------------------------------------------------Could this be Ren's story?! Squeeeee!

54125750,Always Only You,Jessica ,"2,014",12800,5,"January 1, 2021","This book snuck up on me and I had no idea that I would love this as much as I did! This is a sunshine hero and grumpy heroine book, which is a trope I didn't know I needed in my life. Frankie is on the autism spectrum and has arthritis, and she's had bad experiences with relationships in the past dealing with her lifestyle and her physical struggles. She hates feeling like a burn to anyone and doesn't ever want to be treated as less than or less capable than others. She works as a social media manager for the hockey team. Ren is a hockey player on the team and he's liked Frankie from the moment he met her, but he can't do anything about it because they're coworkers. The more Frankie and Ren start to spend time together, the more they start enjoying being around each other. This book was just so cute and I was so in love with the romance. Ren was so patient with Frankie and the communication between those two was AMAZING. Frankie needs things blunt and honest and Ren made sure to tell her exactly what he meant and how he felt. I also loved Ren's whole family and how Frankie got to know them more and grew close with them too. I am really hoping we get a book for every sibling in the series! As a sports romance, this was amazing. We got a lot of hockey and it was still a big part of Ren's life. I loved the forbidden aspect and the really slow development of the romance. This is easily one of my new favorite books and I cannot wait to see what else Chloe Liese has in store for us! ",87,3

That other thing is this: “I can’t deny it any more than i can deny my Harry Potter panties are now as wet as a rainy day at hogwarts”There was another one where they talked about how Hedwig was drowning because of how wet she was.Oh look, you see that, my childhood out of the window”That's an impressive length. If you read Harry Potter with any kind of dedication, you’d know me calling your penis a wand is the worlds best compliment to man”First viking sledgehammer? And now this?! Whats next?All these things made me chuck my kindle down with second hand embarrassment and just sit there wondering how it got past this author's editor. Apart from that I loved this book. Ren is now one of my fav book boyfriends everWe love a man that →reads and curses shakespear  →is caring and loving → has loved the same woman wholeheartedly for 3 years →is a feminist (damn the bar is really on the ground) →is a fantastic hockey player →charitable and kind to everyoneAnd that my friends, was Ren through and through. He was amazing and i loved him with Frankie. He was so patient with her and so kind. There was a whole scene where Frankie got her period and she automatically was like ph my gosh im so sorry ill clean it up. But Ren was so chill and went out to get her pads and made sure she was comfortable.In that moment my heart combust.And I know that that's the bare minimum but like real men are trash, and that's why we read books. And talking about Frankie we love to see autism and arthritis representation in a book. Its so refreshing to see, and I loved seeing Frankies hardships and issues and how she got through them. I also loved her dry humor and the way the team loved her like a mother. Because yeah she was basically the mother to the team. As you probably know, I love big families in books, and this book did not disappoint, i'm gonna have so much fun reading all the families love stories and see the previous couples in the future books. If you liked the kiss quotient, the bride test or the heart principle you will love this! This author deserves more recognition, although this book was not one of my favourites, reading the next book in the series I know this author is amazing. {previous review}ITS REVERSE GRUMPY SUNSHINE OMG NEXT READ RIGHT HEREAND ITS HOCKY ROMANCE YES PLEASE",76,4
54125750,Always Only You,Aoife - Bookish_Babbling,275,297,5,"August 8, 2020","*swoon*I fell hard for these characters, their story but especially their friends and family. Chloe has wonderfully expanded the world she introduced us to in Only When It's Us, with the next Bergman Bro on the totem pole in Ren.The odd one out of the family, being a *gasp* hockey player when everyone else is into football/soccer. This BGE (😈 so glad I get to whip out Big Ginger Energy again) dude is a giant softee with a heart of gold, ready smile & penchant for the classics, but more specifically Shakespeare - indulging the readers to a hilariously inspired ""potty"" mouth for a big tough puck boy *cough* 😉Typically there is something about a ""Mary-Poppins"" *practically perfect in every way* guy that is grating, but for some reason Søren gets away with it - he is so dang endearing!He has had a seemingly unrequited crush on his team Social Media guru, Frankie, since his first day on the team and has been tying himself in knots to keep things professional. She thinks herself a prickly customer, ⛈ to his ☀️, and shelters herself from the world which isn't always easy for her to navigate socially or physically between her autism and rheumatoid arthritis. This being an own voices book is very clear in the way these subjects are handled. Frankie is not the only character on the spectrum and seeing her interact with the others, recognising kindred spirits and aiding them come to terms with how their diagnosis does not have to be debilitating. How everyone is still an individual and there is no one-way forward, helping them see that new parameters just need to be found, boundaries redrawn and communication channels changed a little. Frankie's relationship with Ziggy, is possibly my fav - there was something so pure and heartwarming in their interactions and understanding 🥰 and I am curious to see where they all are when we get Axel's story - such wonderful possibilities but I am getting ahead of myself.Having a friend whose RA returned in her mid 20s, I have had to educate myself as to what flare ups mean and how the pains relocate and come & go without warning. Frankie does not wish to be treated differently nor molly coddled & is not afraid to wield her Elder Wand (loved this name for her cane) to her advantage which led to awesome HP references (garden) although after one scene in the bathroom I feared all their kinky'fying & HP jokes while priceless may make me unable to reread these kids books again 🤣As undeniably 😍 & swoony as I am for the MCs, the side characters will not be ignored. Every single one makes an impact and leaves the most wonderful impressions...well not Maddox, but he is the exception and thankfully plays a very minor role. The rest of the hockey team are like adorkable hyperactive puppies (speaking of shout out to Pazza who also should not be overlooked 🐶), honourable mentions go to Rob & Mildred and the ""Rude Mechanicals"" sounds like such fab fun team building 😎But the real MVPs of the supporting cast are Frankie's bffs, Annie & Lo who are awesomely supportive and call BS on her when needed with some hard truths & tough love. Although the delightful bffs take a slight backseat to the Bergmans themselves. Willa, Ryder & Rooney from book one make delightful cameos (here's hoping the hints dropped about Rooney's interests can be woven into this delicious dynasty 🤩)The ManCubs & bro-call gathering for a romance intervention/summit was far too short IMO - I need a novella of that full conversation plz Kthxbai 🤞My 💞 for Ziggy knows no bounds and I want to protect her at all costs. Axel had way too small a role but there is little doubt in my mind that his time is coming intertwining our cast even deeper and I cannot wait to see how his story will unfold as we revisit topics touched upon in this book but until then 🤐Elin & Dr B make cute appearances with Papa B's heart to hearts being all the more poignant - the way Chloe ties so many themes together in so few pages is commendable and my 💖 is so full for the wonderful way she weaves such layered storytelling together.Hints were dropped about Freya & Aiden and we're told their story is next for which I am super excited about as meet cute romcoms are all well and good but I'm ready to see what Ms Liese will do with an established relationship 🤗 Okay, ok...I know I have probably said way too much - but I really loved this book and fully intend to reread both back to back asap alongside listening to the playlists shared as chapter subheadings. I hope I haven't given too much away, I struggled slightly to start this review but now I cannot seem to stfu & lowkey think I might've said too much 🙊I do just want to round out with a commendation for communication, openness and despite being a sports romance actively bucking against toxic masculinity...now I promise to zip it🙈Final shout out to Sense & Sensibility, which I have not read yet...but may well have to now!*****************************2/7/20 *Pre-ordered* And anxiously awaiting August #alliterationftw",75,16

  Books help me feel a bit more connected to a world that is hard to make sense of. Books are patient with me. They don’t laugh at me instead of with me. They don’t ask why I’m “always” frowning, or why I can’t sit still. Books welcome me -weirdness and all- and take me exactly as I am.
 I had the most ridiculously high expectations for this book and it lived up to all. Always Only You is an unforgettable romance featuring a grumpy, independent heroine and a cinnamon roll, beautiful inside-and-out hero. *Disclaimer: this review is full of quotes and fangirling.
  “She’s the first person who I ever felt right around. Like I’m not a walking contradiction who’ll never belong anywhere, but someone who actually makes a bit of sense. Like I don’t have to choose between these different parts of myself.""
Francesca is the only woman Soren Bergman has ever wanted. Unluckily for him, she works in the same team he plays in, so they can’t be together. But Ren is a patient man and he can -and he will- wait until their love is not forbidden anymore. He only hopes that, when the time comes, Francesca will want him too. When someone breaks into Francesca’s apartment and she comes to his house to live while everything gets fixed, Ren knows it’s now or never. Will he be able to convince her they have always meant to be? 
  I want Francesca Zeferino. She’s been the ultimate goal. And now I finally have a clear shot. 
I LOVED this book since the first pages and didn’t stop loving it until the end. It was such a delicious pleasure to lose myself in it, fangirling and sighing and loving all the gorgeous characters Always Only You is full of. It features two of my favourite trops: a big family with strong bonds and awesome dynamics, and autistic characters. PLUS an it’s-so-perfect-it-hurts hero! WHY are books so beautiful? They will end up spoiling RL!! Meet our hero...
  SOREN BERGMAN. He Who Will Not Stop Smiling.
↬ Hockey player, sunshine bookworm, romantic soul.Ren is not only a hopeless romantic waiting for the woman, a bookworm who cries while reading to children in hospital and a true gentleman with the kindest soul. He is honest, determined, humble, caring... Can someone tell me what is his supposed flaw? Because I didn't see any, but maybe I was too busy dying of love. “Lord help me. He smiles while reading.”Meet our heroine… 
  FRANCESCA ZEFERINO: The Ice Queen. 
↬ Sharp mind, gold heart, iron determination.It’s been so long since I embraced the part of myself that aches to come to life when Ren’s near. The one that laughs and jokes, that hugs hard and kisses deeply. The one that cries at sappy movies and throws open her heart for those she loves. The one that believes someone could love her without one day resenting her, without seeing her laundry list of needs and hurdles as burdens but rather as beautiful parts of what make her her.Frankie doesn’t want a relationship, for all people she ever loved ended up seeing her as a burden and breaking her in the process. Her caring heart is now well hidden beneath layers of coldness and she’s not letting it out. Frankie hardly ever smiles, jokes or shows feelings. She’s deadly serious on the outside, but her mind is the funniest. 
  Archaic male demonstrations of protectiveness are not sexy.
 Archaic male demonstrations of protectiveness are not sexy. Archaic- Dammit, this is sexy and my body knows it. I can’t deny it any more than I can deny my Harry Potter panties are now as wet as a rainy day at Hogwarts.She loves reading and her POV is full of HP-related comments. How I’m supposed to not love her?? Also, THAT critic. Chloe Liese, I salute you! “ What did she do now?” “Just showed that you can write a magical world brimming with complex, label-defying characters and still be a trans-exclusionary feminist disappointment.”The amount of  iconic, complex, non-cliché characters Always Only You has is breathtaking. I’m pretty sure I’ve just found a new favourite author, I can’t wait to read the other books in the Bergman series *cough* Rooney and Axel *cough*. I have only read one scene with these two, but it was enough for me to know they are going to rock my world. When he notices Rooney, he does a double take. “Your hair is shorter.”“Yeah, I chopped it. What do you think?”He stares at her, wetting his bottom lip with his tongue. “You changed it.”Her smile falters. “You don’t like it?”() Axel stares at Rooney still. “I think… I need to get used to it. In my head you have long hair.” “Well, at least I’m in your head.”DAMN GIRL! Also, why is this book full of bookworms and where are they in RL?? I need to be adopted by the Bergmans; Ziggy, Frankie and I would be besties. I think Ziggy is reading. At her own birthday party. Smart girl.Overall, Always Only You is the perfect romance if you love friends-to-lovers, slow-burn, nerdy heroes, great side characters, big families, autistic characters and independent, brilliant heroines. Chloe Liese’s writing is sexy, light and heart-warming, focused on real characters full of life and authenticity. I can’t wait to read more by her, and if you haven’t yet, I truly recommend to give this one a try!! 
  We love, entranced by the breathtaking view, and we fall, not knowing where we’ll land.

    “Nobody knows if love’s going to hurt them. You simply have to take a chance.”
  
then you have a heroine who ✦objectifies✦ and lusts after the hero pretty much every chance she gets; YET - despite not being ashamed of her disability and autism - is annoyingly stubborn and a bit of a wimp when it comes to opening herself up to love and commitment.i mean, gIRL what more do you need?!? god himself??? idk how anyone could surpass the H’s level of perfection. 😭idk if i ‘subconsciously’ didnt love this out of spite because literally every single review i came across gave this four stars and above OR if the Bergman charm just wore off for me in this one. it was disgustingly cute and all, but none of the scenes really hit home.
  
    “You have my heart, Søren Bergman,” she whispers against my neck. “Please, please be careful with it.”
  
the hero is simply tOooOo flawless, and thats a flaw in itself in my book. add to that, the feminism and Shakespearean talk, all of those combined honestly made the book seemed rather posey and pretentious in my eyes. still very much a fan of the writing tho.

Any hardships, anything difficult in your life, well, I'll just be grateful that I get to be with you as you weather it""  This might be the perfect book. I find literally no fault in it. Hard and tough social media manager Frankie Zeferino works for the same team professional hockey player adorably soft Ren Bergman plays for, they've known for years that dating each other has been off limits. That has not however stopped the incessant longing and with Frankie about to leave the team to start law school they might finally have a chance at being together within their reach. So lets look at what we have here.I am always a sucker for a grumpy/sunshine book and here we have it bUT in which she is grumpy and he is sunshine. AMAZING. He is an adorable professional hockey player and Shakespeare fanatic to the point of being in a literal Shakespeare club. And for once the Hero is the one who is the virgin!! (I've gotten really sick of the whole man whore/ virgin trope because as we all know virginity is in fact a societal construct).She is a hardened social media manager who is secretly soft and sweet as well as having Rheumatoid Arthritis and Autism. AND ITS AN OWN VOICES STORYI think above all when I'm reading a romance the ones I tend to love the most are the ones which are centred around a relationship which at its core is built on attentiveness and unconditional support. I adore stories in which the characters remember little things about their partner or do small tasks to make their lives easier. Both Frankie and Ren we're so supportive in each others lives whether it was Frankie spending time with his little sister so his parents could watch his hockey game or Ren buying her a new shirt because some asshole spilled a drink on her and it was one with magnetic snaps to make it more accessible for her (It was at this point I knew this book would be getting five stars and it literally in the 4th chapter). I absolutely adored the characterisation of Frankie and Ren, they were both so different but both so richly portrayed. There really isn't any character in this series I don't love. Books which focus around a family are my absolute favourites and I love getting to see all the Bergman family together particularly since that means seeing Ryder and Willa again!!!Chloe Liese's books are seriously adorable like- ""I navigated us per her request to the In-N-Out drive-through, prepared to buy the franchise if necessary, whatever it took to put a smile on her face""    ""Yes I have a tender spot for the six-foot-three cinnamon roll   THESE TWO ARE SERIOUSLY ADORABLEI cannot wait for the next book in this series I have adored these first two books so much, there are not enough inclusive romance stories being told and these books are always going to have a special place in my heart.",58,N/A
