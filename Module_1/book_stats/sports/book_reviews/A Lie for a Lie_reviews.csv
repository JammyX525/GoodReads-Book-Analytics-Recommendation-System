  3 Stars!
... A story set in the hockey world.I hate myself. I loved the starting chapters, mostly the part when they were in Alaska. But when I reached the second half, I got bored. And I hated myself for that. I think the best thing that happened in the story was Kody. He was so adorable and cute! Note: This is a sports, second chance romance. A Lie for a Lie is the first book in the All In series. Rook and Lainey were likeable characters. I loved their first meeting on the plane. I was so excited because I expected Alaska as the main setting, who won't love wilderness, by the way? But that's where I was wrong. After a year of losing contact, Rook and Lainey crossed paths again in Chicago. Each had a lie. A surprise that wasn't really a surprise. Ya, to be honest, this book was predictable. I don't know if it was the author's way of showing us a ""dramatic irony"" or she was just poor in ""subtlety?""This book was a full package of questionable reasons made use of in order to force Rook and Lainey to be together, or separating them apart, vice versa. I mean like, for example, the sharing of cabin was an obvious set up. It felt far-fetched that Lainey ended up on a beat-up cabin—she was smart—and completely unbelievable that the rental staffs were in a vacation. I don't usually mind small details like these, but I couldn't ignore it because I also travel, and I've never experienced such things before. The countless sex but never thought of exchanging numbers was a lame set up. And folks, they didn't even have shared their complete names. It was impossible because they'd spent weeks together. We're in the 21st Century, don't we? I would know the full name of someone I attracted to on the first date. The encounter in Chicago was an expected set up. Y'all understand what I mean? Rook was a NHL team captain in Chicago at the same time Lainey found a job she loves at the same place. I believe in fate, but seriously, just for the sake of bringing them back again? I was overwhelmed by these coincidences. Add these things that I can't articulate anymore. The surprise trope. The hero's lie. The unseen letter in the cabin. The second chance trope. They were small things made complicated for the sake of conflict that didn't even keep my interest at all, and were the exact causes of my boredom. Regardless, despite of these stuffs, despite it typical and predictable, I was intrigued by the secondary characters and I look forward to reading the rest of the series. I recommend this to those who likes: Helena Hunting, sports, romantic comedy, second chance, insta-love, and a happily ever after.

I love Helena Hunting and I was so excited to read A Lie for a Lie. It had a connection to her ‘Pucked’ series, which I adored and the beginning and the end of this book were amazing for me. Seriously, I loved so much of this story. BUT… and this is a big but… this book had my least favorite troupe. It took so much enjoyment out of the story for me. I’m sure it’s more of a ‘me’ thing, because almost anytime I read about this in a book I’m not a fan. Either way, I loved RJ and Lainey and I’m excited to read the next book in this series which will feature Rooke’s sister and teammate. I’m here for it!",100,14

I went into this thinking I was going to get a cute, second-chance romance set in Alaska and instead I got an accidental pregnancy story set mostly in Chicago. If you don't mind that trope, you'll probably enjoy this as it wasn't necessarily a terrible book! However, that trope is literally my least favorite romance trope and it ruined the entire book for me. I definitely think that the synopsis of this book should be re-worked before release because it is extremely misleading.

  An emotionally, persuasive, addicting, and enticing romance novel that will have you weak on your knees for more of Lainey and Rookie...
So I have been in such a massive book slump, a book slump that has me so behind on my Goodreads book challenge. Of course, Helena Hunting knows how to swoop in and destroy all my emotions and make me fall head over heels with her writing all over again. Not that I wasn't already, but this book slump has been killing me in the worst of ways. Lainey and Rookie have found a way to finally get me in the groove of just simply being enamored with them. Their story is one of a kind story that had me swooning, enthralled and had me feeling so many new emotions! Everyone must read their story because it is one you don't want to miss out on ;)ARC kindly provided by Montlake Romance, in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Blog ❁ Instagram ❁ Facebook ❁ Twitter",70,8

A million memories come flooding back at her soft whimper and the bite of her nails against the back of my neck. And just like every single other kiss that’s had the intention of becoming more—and even the ones that didn’t—it starts out sweet. She tastes the same, feels the same—but better. She feels like mine and home and love.Helena Hunting is the Queen of sports romances! I am incredibly excited about her new ”All In” series. Not only was ”A LIE FOR A LIE” filled with angst that hurt so good and heart-racing steaminess, it also reunites us with most of the unforgettable characters from the ”PUCKED” series. If the rest of the books are as good as this one, I have no doubt this spin-off series focusing on the newly formed NHL team in Seattle is going to become a fast fan favorite. I guarantee that readers are going to fall pretty darn hard for ROOK “RJ” Bowman! If you’re as crazy about romances with sexy Hockey players as I am, you are in for a delicious treat with RJ and Lainey’s second chance love story.

    My skin burns. My heart stutters. I should tell him my own truth. But for now we’re tied: a lie for a lie.
  
ALL. OF. THE. SWOONS.This series couldn't have started with a better book. I'm totally hooked, line and sinker, and already salivating for more. I'm head over skates in love with Rook and this swoony hockey romance about a reformed NHL star playboy and the quirky nerd that makes him fall.
  
    On this plane I’m not the NHL forward and team captain with a history of being a player on and off the ice. I’m just a guy, and she’s just a girl.
  
Rook is an NHL star and a former manwhore. He's a man that's used to puck bunnies doing anything to get his attention and then getting even crazier to keep it. So when he meets a beautiful woman on his flight to Alaska that ends up being his neighbor, he loves the anonymity of getting to know someone as just him. Lainey is a bit of a nerd and a lot of adorable. She's a quirky, shy, sweet, and although slightly sheltered in her home schooled ways has also seen things that changed her irrevocably. They don't see the other one coming but it doesn't take long at all for them to being a whirlwind romance in the small town of Alaska. But then Rook has an emergency that forces him to leave and as fate would have it they lose touch due to a number of circumstances. Only to be reunited 14 months later in Chicago. This time, Rook knows that he'll do anything to keep Lainey, if only he can get her to forgive him for the lie.This was so wonderfully sweet. It was brimming with emotion and sweet heat. I couldn't get enough of Rook and Lainey. I also loved Lainey's friendship with Eden, who made for a wonderful secondary character. All of your favorites make a cameo here and I loved how Helena brought it all together. I loved this sweet second chance romance and can't recommend it enough for all Helena Hunting fans. And if you haven't read any books by her yet, this is a great one to start with! ARC courtesy of author in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:  ",50,1 comment
44776456,A Lie for a Lie,Melanie (mells_view),"1,680",310,4,"October 15, 2019","I should tell him my own truth. But for now we’re tied: a lie for a lie.A Lie for a Lie is what I call a great start to a promising spin-off series. If you’ve read Hunting’s Pucked series, then you will be familiar with some of the characters in this one. That being said I don’t think it’s necessary to read them to enjoy this one, because I’ve only read a couple and easily followed along here. Rook and Lainey spend a sweet and steamy few weeks together in the Alaskan wilderness. But circumstances and little white lies come into play that leave them separated without a way to contact one another. When they find their way back to each other it is by fate and circumstance alone. There’s just more at play than there was the summer before when they were together.Anyway. I don’t want to spoil anything so am I’m going to say is that this story is a second chance romance with two people who got to know each other’s heart and learned each other... well biblically... in a blissful bubble. When they meet again they learn some truths they hadn’t before, and have to figure out how they work (or don’t) in their real lives. I think Helena did a fantastic job making this one sweet, heartfelt, and steamy, while still having a bit of the funny that the series it’s spun off of had. I think the characters are great, and I’m excited to see even more of some of the new ones in the rest of the series.If you like sports romance, second chances, or Hunting’s writing, then you definitely need to check this one out when it releases!!Available on Amazon & Kindle Unlimited!!*ARC provided by NetGalley and Montlake Romance",47,1 comment

Alaska Girl) - the youngest of seven kids, she grew up on a farm and was homeschooled. Since then she has gotten 3 PHD’s and is on her way to Alaska to study whales and dolphins. Her mother worries about her and she suffers from anxiety attacks.The Hero(s): R.J. (a.k.a Rook) - NHL standout and team captain. When he was a rookie, he went through a period where he was a playboy and took full advantage of all the puck bunnies following after his team. He now sees how empty that life is and isn’t looking for anything like that. The Story: Lainey and R.J. meet on the plane to Alaska. He is in the off season and is going on a yearly fishing trip he took with his father and brother. Though his father died and his brother can’t make it this year so he is taking the trip alone. Lainey literally falls into his lap on the plane and he helps her through some anxiety along the way. This series was an offshoot of the Pucked Series and I was happy to see Rook’s teammates were the guys we know from that series. This book was a bit more serious than the Pucked books but was just as good. I was glad that though the book was centered around a Lie, it didn’t go over the top like some books. Sometimes characters in books seem to kind of make a mountain out of a mole hill when it comes to lies. Sure being honest and being able to trust someone is important but everyone lies, and one lie doesn’t necessarily make a dishonest person. Especially when the reasons behind the lie can be easily explained and understood.The narration was done by Jason Clarke and Stella Bloom and they did a bang up job. I really enjoy Jason Clarke as the Hero and Stella Bloom sounded age appropriate for Lainey. Helena Hunting does very well with the Sports Romance trope and I could read her books every day!

  ”I’ve missed the way my heart feels when you’re close to me—so please, be careful with it this time around.”“My heart is stronger for having been broken and healed by the man who gave me my greatest love. And from here, we get to watch it grow together.”
🔸Synopsis:🔸RJ (aka Rook) is an NHL captain and on his way to Alaska to do some fishing. - 
  ”I crave the peace and solitude I find in Alaska and the escape from the circus my life has become.”
As the plane is boarding, a woman literally falls into RJ’s lap. Lainey is a bit quirky but completely adorable and RJ is hooked. - 
  ”My scarf is caught,” she rasps. “Oh my God. I’m choking myself. I’m so sorry. This is so embarrassing.”- “Choking to death on an attractive man’s lap really isn’t the way I wanted to go.”
RJ is so happy to finally be with someone who has no clue who he is, so he doesn’t share that little tidbit about his profession with Lainey. - 
  ”Here on this plane I’m not the NHL forward and team captain with a history of being a player on and off the ice. I’m just a guy, and she’s just a girl.”
When RJ is called back due to a family emergency that spells the end for RJ and Lainey because thanks to fate, circumstances prevent them from connecting once they leave Alaska. Fast forward fourteen months later and a chance meeting in Chicago brings them face to face. As they take a chance on each other again, more than one lie will be uncovered. - 
  ”I missed you every day for more than a year. I missed the smell of your shampoo, the way you feel in my arms, the sound of your voice, the softness of your skin.”
🔸Overview:🔸- Trigger warning:  none- Audio:  came with my Kindle Unlimited download. I’m not usually a big fan of audio but I thought Jason Clarke and Stella Bloom did a good job- Setting:  Chicago, IL- Do you need to read previous books in series?: If you’ve read the Pucked series, then some of the couple cameos in this book will be familiar. However, it’s not necessary to read the other series to understand this one- POV: Dual POV- Tropes: athlete, second chance, baby surprise- Who is the Hero? RJ (aka Rook). Has been playing pro hockey for the last 7 seasons. He’s captain of a Chicago team. His dad died a few years ago, he is close with his mom and siblings. * The following words/phrases were used to describe Hero: notorious playboy, charming, handsome, sexy, skeptical of people’s real motives for wanting to be with him, talented, nice guy, sweet- Who is the Heroine? Lainey (25). Working on her 3rd Master’s degree. She grew up on a dairy farm, was home schooled, has seven siblings, was a bit sheltered growing up and has some social anxiety * The following words/phrases were used to describe Heroine: curious, honest, babbles when nervous, smart, a breath of fresh air, alluring, loves learning new things, fascinating, says whatever is on her mind, sweet, innocent, a touch naive, fierce, strong, determined- h virgin? No- First time they kiss: 19%- First time they sleep together: 31%- First time they say I Love You  83%- steamy? There are descriptive bedroom scenes, but it’s a long span between the first one at 31% and the next one at 83%- OW/OM drama? No- H/h cheat? No- Time apart? They spend 14 months apart after their time spent at the cabin in Alaska. Once they are back together again, no time apart- Did I skip pages? No- Big secrets? 29% Lainey shares something from her past. Lainey finds out what RJ does for a living around 40%. RJ finds out Lainey’s secret around 53%- Did I cry? No- Did I laugh?  A few smiles here and there- Did I swoon 🥰?  Yes!!! RJ is a swoony dad ❤️- Cliffhanger? No- HEA?  Yes- Epilogue? 4 months later- Recommend? yes. I really enjoyed this story. 
  - “I can’t go back in time and change how things happened, but I’m trying to make up for it. So I’m here, taking care of her the best I know how.”- “Little by little he’s erasing his lie and earning my trust with everything he does.”
📚
  The following are my thoughts about this book: 
- I thought the circumstances that caused them to lose touch were mostly believable. - The supporting characters added to the story. Walter......creepy; Lainey’s overprotective mother was kind of awful. (I’m glad Lainey stood up for herself); RJ’s no-filter sister.....loved her; bestie Eden....everyone needs a friend like her. - I believed RJ really was disappointed that they lost touch and that he truly cared about Lainey. - RJ as a dad......swoony. 🥰- 
  “I think if it wasn’t for you, your mom wouldn’t be giving me a second chance. So thank you. I love you, buddy, and I’m hoping I get to say that to you every day for the rest of my life. Even when you’re a teenager and it embarrasses the shit out of you.”
- low on angst. Once they are together, they make it work without a ton of drama. No “I’m not good enough for you” or “I’m not ready to admit my feelings” crap. 👍- I loved that they made decisions together. Such a refreshing mature couple walking life’s path and dealing with life’s curve balls as a committed couple. Yeah! 👍👍- 
  ”I want us to do this together. Make decisions together, figure out life and how to parent and how to get our kid to eat green things. I want to love you. I want to get razzed by your brothers at Christmas dinners. If you want to stay here, then the no-trade clause stays in effect—but if you want Seattle, then I lift the clause and we go.”
🔸Quotes🔸“Thanks. I think you’re beautiful too.” She cringes. “I mean handsome. You’re very nice to look at, with or without a shirt on. When I fell in your lap on the airplane, I remember thinking, At least I fell on someone nice looking.”“I just wanted someone to see me, authentically see me, and I felt like you did. I never felt more like myself than I did when I was with you.”“I’m sure it’s the flu and that she’s definitely not pregnant. That’s not . . . that would be impossible.” And that, right there, has to be the most awkward of awkward first conversations with the woman I’m assuming will one day be my mother-in-law.”“So, that actually happened.” RJ wears an amused grin. “I feel like I can add and cross getting sprayed with breast milk off my bucket list, which is right up there with getting peed on by my son.”“Lainey comes across as delicate at times, when in reality her innocence and sense of adventure are exactly the things that make her stronger and more resilient than people give her credit for.”“Bedroom?” I ask. “Floor, couch, kitchen counter. I don’t really care.”“That show is on when Lainey gives Kody his before-bed booby snacks.”",38,4
44776456,A Lie for a Lie,Ⓐlleskelle - That ranting lady ッ,981,764,2,"October 20, 2019","I'm not sure how to rate this one because although I didn't hate it, nothing made it truly enjoyable either. I guess I can safely rate 2 stars : It was ok.And it was. Ok, I mean. Granted that I don't have a successful history record when it comes to this author's books, I decided to give this one a try based on 3 things mentioned in the blurb.1)Hero is a hockey player, 2)they meet on a plane, 3)second chance at love trope.In that aspect, I appreciated the aforementioned. The meet cute was, well, cute. Their attraction and the reason for them sticking together during their time on Kodiac island felt pretty contrived on the pages. With the heroine stranded in a dump cottage (sharing her bed with rodents—dead and alive, spiders, a leaky roof, not hot water and dusty covers) I thought the author laid it on pretty thick with the reasons that pushed Lainey to join RJ at his deluxe cabin. Despite the OBVIOUS set up, I thought they were cute together and was looking forward to the angsty part of the story, the part when the hero's lie about being a famous hockey player comes into play.Except there was no angst to be found. After being separated for about a year and a half, Lainey reappears in RJ's life with a surprise—this is a spoiler but since the author isn't being subtle, you can easily guess what kind of surprise it is — and from here on out, things got so domestic they became quickly boring. I wasn't even interested in reading the epilogue. I skipped it. So that's the level of my investment with this book. I didn't stay for the HEA. Yikes.It could have been a nice read, there just wasn't any spark brought into a trope that has been done so many times in romance.

  I always get a little tingle when I dive back into these stories featuring the hottest hockey players around!
 Rook was 
  spectacular
 and I didn't expect any less from Helena Hunting. Ever since I started reading the Pucked series, I knew I'd be in for a heck of a lot more men to fall in love with and I am 
  soooo
 in love with Rook! Don't get it twisted though... Lance Romero is 
  still freaking MINE!!
Okay, so back to the oh so perfect Rook. He was charming, easy going, smart, funny, thoughtful, sensitive, and he had an enormous heart. From the start I decided that he deserved all that was good in the world and I sat back to enjoy his journey to happily ever after. And at first, I really liked Lainey. She was sweet and shy, reserved and unique, quirky and awkward and vulnerable. There's something about the vulnerability of a character that really grabs me and I was gripped. But then the secrets came and honestly, hers was the freaking 
  WORST.

  
    My skin burns.My heart stutters.I should tell him my own truth.But for now we’re tied: a lie for a lie.
  
I enjoyed the heck out of this story. For Rook alone, I'd read this book time and time again. I found something magical within this author's words and I'd love to lose myself in them once more. If you love sweet romance stories full of heart and second chances, you'll be
