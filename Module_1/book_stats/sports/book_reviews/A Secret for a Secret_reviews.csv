49091311,A Secret for a Secret,Giorgia Reads,944,1719,4,"May 15, 2020"," 4.5 Stars  This was simply beautiful. I can confidently say it was the best out of the series so far. While there is nothing extraordinary about it, everything just fit together so peacefully. King and Queenie call each other the calm and the chaos respectively, and I find that description so beautifully fitting. They are truly good for each other in an opposites attract kind of way, but it goes way beyond that as well. Usually opposites attract but they also burn through the novelty and excitement of it all pretty quickly. I loved that their differences were discussed in a way that didn’t gloss over them by preaching the whole “love will conquer it all” mantra. They discuss their differences, plan on how to deal and accept them while respecting each other’s needs and wants. The way anyone would describe King would probably be “perfect”. They wouldn’t be wrong, except, no one is perfect. He needed passion and healthy recklessness in his life and Queenie needed stability, support and understanding. To be honest I’ve never read of a more balanced couple. Reading this made me feel good, peaceful even. I realised that the writer reached a good balance where this was able to be a safe, sweet story that did not fall in the trap of being boring in the slightest. Apart from the story itself I loved reading about the other characters and their kids, especially Violet’s twins, one of whom will develop a sweet relationship with Queenie. I also liked reading the conversations about anxiety in children and ways of dealing and helping through art. This book was exactly what I needed at the moment and it was a great addition to the series. King, is the kind of hero we can say we love and want without adding “but not in real life” at the end.

I’ve read a lot of Helena Hunting’s books and as much as I’ve enjoyed them, I was surprised to find that I hadn’t given any of them a full 5 stars… until now. A Secret for a Secret was such a great read for me. It was just what I needed and by far my favorite book of hers. Ryan Kingston is a NHL goalie and the good guy of hockey. He is respectful, kind, follows the rules and always makes the right calls. One night, he’s out and drinks a little too much, totally not his normal and has his first one-night stand. And six weeks later… he finds out his one night stand, Queenie, is the general manager’s daughter. Yikes. Queenie is not quite the rule follower that King is. She’s a bit wild and impulsive. She’s trying to become a little less irresponsible and is working for her dad. Seeing King turns her world upside down. Especially when the one rule her dad gave her was to stay away from the hockey players. King and Queenie love spending time together and decide being friends is better than nothing at all. Until they can no longer deny the attraction and connection they share. They completely balance one another out and make the best friends to lovers couple.
  
    She’s a tornado, and half the time I don't know what to do with her, but still want to get caught up in her vortex.
  
 We all know Helena Hunting does an amazing job writing steamy scenes and alpha athletes, but who knew she could write the perfect, straight-laced, sweet, and most romantic hero? I fell so hard for Ryan Kingston and as much as I loved Queenie, King was the best part of this book for me. I loved watching Queenie finally find her King. If you’re looking for a sweet, funny, and steamy romance with a hero that will sweep you off your feet, look no further. This is Helena Hunting at her best, and I can guarantee A Secret for a Secret will be on my 2020 favorites list.
  
    I feel like I’ve finally found my person. The one who won’t try to tame my chaos but will let me live in it and help me balance my impulsiveness with stability. He’s yin and I’m yang. He’s sugar and I’m salt.

  An emotional and compelling romance, filled with many secrets to be revealed and cherished by two individuals that learn how to fall in love with each other...
So this third installment, has officially stolen my heart and has claimed it! That's right, Kingston... my sexy and very romantic Ryan Kingston has taken a toll of grasping my beating heart and make it beat much faster for all the ways he expresses his admiration towards Queenie. In the little things he does, his blushes, his tenderness, his way of being is what draws you in to him.Though the title does indeed say it all. Sharing one secret with another is what this story revolves itself around. But once they both open up to each other, breaking down those walls in which reveal the truth of Quennie's past as well as prepare and build a future with Kingston. Everything about Queenie is what truly draws Kingston to wanting more of her, not just because she makes him act like a totally different person when they are intimate involuntarily, but also because her true identity is what makes him fall even deeper in love with her;
  
     ""She's a tornado, and half the time I don't know what to do with her, but still want to get caught up in her vortex..."" 
  
When obstacles are in the way, Kingston knows to not give up on Queenie because he also knows that there is no going back once he has a claim on her. And Queenie knows that being with Ryan is something she cannot pass out on since her heart is the one who takes over for her and her love for him;
  
     ""He's the calm to my storm.My still lake at dawn.My king..."" 
  
There is no denying at all that Ryan will forever own my heart. I am not sure if this is the last installment in the series, though there are many other hockey players in which have been mentioned that I would love to read a book of. We just have to be patient and see what else Helena has up her sleeves...ARC kindly provided by Montlake Romance, in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Instagram ❁ Twitter",128,16

49091311,A Secret for a Secret,Lisa (Two Bookish Brits),748,154,5,"May 12, 2020","Once again Helena has managed to do what she does best and created a masterpiece, a man you can’t help but fall for and a heroine you instantly love. A Secret for a Secret is the third book in the All In series and can be read as a stand-alone but I’d recommend reading them in order to get the backstory of other character in the book. When we were first introduced to Kingston I was intrigued. He’s kind of like Darren (from the Pucked series) in ways, he keeps himself to himself. He’s super quiet and at times quite nervous. King is loving and kind and fierce at times when it comes to those he loves. It’s been quite enjoyable reading this book and unraveling the parcel that is Kingston. Queenie, oh this woman has been through a lot. She has mommy issues and doesn’t feel like she’s good at anything and it truly hurts to see her feel like that. We get to see just how talented this woman is throughout the book. She’s determined to be independent and not rely on anyone. She’s an intriguing character and I just love her so much. These two together are polar opposites. He’s neat, likes everything in place and she’s not. She’s a storm, a chaotic storm and leaves everything, everywhere. But put those two together and they work. It’s so much fun to see. Helena truly delivered on this one. King and Queenie are two characters that have embedded themselves on my heart and I’ll never forget them. They’re perfectly imperfect and it suits them so well. I’ve been a fan of Helena’s for so long and she never ever fails to bring us a book that’ll hook us in and keep us addicted. I truly can’t wait to see what comes from her in the future. A Secret for a Secret is a forbidden, sports romance that’s super sexy and adorable all mixed together. It’s fun, emotional and filled with flirty moments. It’s a book that you won’t want to put down until you hit the last page. ARC received in exchange for an honest review",61,N/A

I live for a hero who appreciates nearly every single thing about a heroine that she considers a flaw about herself. Nothing gives me the feels more than a hero who knows to give a heroine the space to grow at her own pace, and supports her while she does it. Ryan Kingston is all of that, and Queenie is the perfect passionate storm that blows into the calm that is his life.Queenie and King start as one night of unexpected fun when they both needed it. When they are pushed back together as sort of co-workers, Queenie being King’s bosses daughter, they decide it’s best to keep it platonic. *insert side eye* But I think we all know how that song and dance goes. This one was just so dang good. Of course there is some silly drama, and some laugh out loud moments, this IS a Helena Hunting novel, but at its core this is two opposite souls clicking into place.A Secret for A Secret is a yin and yang love story that will make you swoon hard and feel all of the feels.

Six weeks later, when the season begins, King finds out that Queenie is not only the new assistant to his team’s general manager, but his daughter as well. Helena Hunting does hockey romance like nobody else and I love all of them. I recently read Little Lies which is a spinoff series from this and the Pucked series and I loved to see Lavender, River and Kodiak from that book as little kids in this one. Queenie from this book also appeared in Little Lies, so it was nice to see her before she had her life together. The book was told in dual points of view via dual narration. Narration was done by Stella Bloom and Jason Clarke who are two of my favorites. Jason has a deep sexy voice and Stella has a clear voice and she is great at portraying emotion through her voice.

I had liked the H in the previous book in the series, so I was happy to get him again and that he got a HEA. I like the opposites attract type stories and we definitely get that here. I did, however, struggle with the h after a while. I like my hs confident and where they are still strong in their vulnerability. I understand that her mom messed her up, but it kind of bugged me that she didn’t actively try to work on that damage — especially since she was a psych major. That might just be my own psych degree talking and some projecting...but it bugged me. Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Queenie and Ryan’s story. They meet when both of them are in a bad place in a bar and have a (kind of) ONS. They then are both shocked when they find out that Queenie has started a new job as an assistant to her dad who is the General Manager for Ryan’s professional hockey team. They become friends but then cannot deny the attraction to each other they still feel after their night together and end up giving in. There is some ex and family drama and some sexy times...and they get a HEA ending.Point Of View (POV): This alternated between Queenie and Ryan’s POV.Overall Pace of Story:  Good. I never skimmed and I thought it flowed well.Instalove: NoH (Hero) rating: 4.5 stars. Ryan. I really liked him. He was straight laced (except in the bedroom) and he’s super sweet and loyal.

49091311,A Secret for a Secret,Wendy'sThoughts,"2,632",3208,4,"March 19, 2021","4.5 Rules to Be Broken Stars* * * * 1/2 Spoiler FreeWe have heard over and over again, opposites attract. When there is an agreement over the ages about something like this, it is no surprise when it turns out to be true. Helena Hunting took this idea and made it one of the core meanings in A Secret for a Secret. Ryan Kingston, the goalie for Seattle's NHL team, is trying desperately to get drunk. He has lined up numerous potent drinks and is struggling to down any of them. Were they made incorrectly-nopeWere they not tasty-nopeThey were perfectly fine. The problem was that Kingston wasn't a drinker. The only drink he indulged in was...Milk, gallons of it. So as he sat at the bar, taking sips of these drinks, it was like he was taking medicine and the medicine was going to get him what he needed...A Blinding, Solid Drunk. Queenie Masterson is after the same results, however, she has no problem downing two martinis one right after the other. She is sitting next to King and wonders out loud why he has all these drinks in front of him. King, introduces himself as Ryan, why, he has no idea, and proceeds to say he learned a secret about his life today and wants to just forget about everything. Queenie, understanding exactly that feeling and shares with Ryan she too has had a terrible day and has another secret to share. Both look at each other and at that moment decide to share a secret for a secret. They tell what has been the deepest, darkest thing that is giving them this pain, and the telling is liberating. It also binds them and Queenie decides to guide Ryan into having shots, and then see where things go. Well, They Go Extremely Well, Thank You Very Much. Ryan wakes, hungover barely able to get out of the bed, and looks for Queenie. Unfortunately, all that is left of this amazing, sensual, amazing woman is a post-it note telling him thanks, but no telephone number for him to follow up. This is really disappointing because Ryan wanted to go out with Queenie and get to know her better. She had this energy, nothing like his normal vibe. She was like an exploding star, bright and shiny. As he remembers their time together, how intense and clearly very different from his time with his ex-girlfriend for the past years, Ryan cannot put it aside. Which is very unusual for Ryan. Ryan has always been able to compartmentalize things, yet Queenie keeps seeping into his head. She is there when he goes through his numerous routines. His cleaning up, his exact driving, and organized eating pattern directed by his phone alarms. Ryan isn't the only one who has had thoughts about the sexy time they shared. Queenie has spent many a night reliving the dirty, filthy things this conservatively dressed hunk of a man did...yes, he left quite an impression. Queenie is back in Seattle because she has returned home to try to figure out her life. It seems Queenie hasn't been able to get herself on a path for some time now. Queenie, being 24, felt it was time to be settled, have her career on track. She should not be starting a new position as her father's personal assistant. As the General Manager of the Hockey team, her dad had always had an assistant, so the position made sense. It just frustrated Queenie that once again, she ran to her dad to help her and she felt she should be doing more. It is the first day of the new season for Ryan and as the team is gathered to go through the usual meetings, talks from the GM and Coaches, he sees this beautiful woman with her back to him and the team. When she turns, he is shocked to see the bedmate he has been dreaming of...there right in front of him. After a couple of worries about her relationship with the GM, it turns out she is his daughter. Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...And Queenie is just as shocked because her dad asked her to not get involved with any of the people involved with the team, on the ice and off. This is the perfect set up and if this story was about this conflict only, it would entertain. But Helena Hunting took it to another level involving multiple layers of conflicts and cray cray. We have both of them wanting to be with each other but fighting their desires because of the dad. We have Ryan's family and all of their insanity, Hannah not included. There are ex's popping up and causing all sorts of things. Through it all, though, you have Ryan standing right beside Queenie supporting when she thinks she doesn't deserve it. He is what she needs and she is everything he never knew he wanted. This story took me by the hand, told the story of Still Waters Run Deep...and just because a guy wears khakis and polo shirts, don't assume he is all J. Crew and not hiding an alpha beast underneath. I do not know if this is it for this series. I think for sure a little novella may be coming for Queenie's dad...if not, Ms. Hunting...hint hint...just sayin' there is something there...

THIS GIRL! And I loved him even more after reading his wonderful love story with his queen, Queenie. How freaking adorable is that? I love me a funny, sugary sweet and steamy sports romance and Helena Hunting is one of the best authors at those. Obviously, she did not fail with this whole series and neither with A Secret for a Secret. This crew of characters is just that amazing!So, A Secret for a Secret is Helena’s third installment in her All In series and it focuses on the “forbidden” relationship between King and Queenie. These two are not in their best moment and they found understanding and a whole lot of chemistry in a drunken passionate one night stand. They did not imagine they would run into each other again. Well, things get complicated when this couple meets again in a meeting where King realizes Queenie is the daughter of the GM in the hockey team he is the goalie of. Things are about to get secretive, steamy and emotional!
  She’s a tornado, and half the time I don’t know what to do with her, but I still want to get caught up in her vortex.
I loved this couple! Gah, they were so freaking cute together! Ryan Kingston is different from what you expect in the typical romance hero and I appreciated that. He is such a good man, tender, attentive, loving and SHY! And Queenie is just as strong and endearing. It was great to read how she finds herself all over again throughout the book. I just adored how this love relationship developed, how they peel the vulnerable layers off of each other, sharing their secrets and falling in love in the process. That turns into a beautiful relationship, with a bit of light drama, a mind-blowing chemistry and a whole lot of feels. 
  I feel like I’ve finally found my person. The one who won’t try to tame my chaos but will let me live in it and help me balance my impulsiveness with stability. He’s yin and I’m yang. He’s sugar and I’m salt.
Therefore, I am rating A Secret for a Secret with 4.5 STARS because it was a great addition to the All In series. Completely different from the other two books but still in the same style that we all love from Helena Hunting. I loved King and Queenie, I loved their relationship and I loved the moments with the rest of the crew. These characters are just amazing and freaking hilarious! I hope we get more books because I am definitely ready for more. Gah, I am so happy these two got together and they got their HEA. Highly recommend!CHECK OUT MY BLOG HERE:

  🎧 Audiobook Review 🎧
I'm still on my busy week/month/life after covid, and couldn't stop to actually read a book! So thanks to Kindle unlimited with audible narration, I've been able to grab a few listening moments between my work and drive.This book is one of those included on the program, and it was on my May's TBR before the next release 
  A Kiss for a Kiss.
This is my favorite series by Helena Hunting and I can say that A secret for a secret is a favorite book too!Since the first book, Kingston and his polite-good boy-glass of milk ways, I was intrigued and excited about his story! I don't even know why it took me soo long to read it!He's an incredible character and the perfect hero! He's also super sexy and irresistible!On the other side of this amazing couple is Queenie... And she is a mess! 😂😂For every put together and well folded piece of King's life, there's at least 10 crumpled and smelly pieces of Queenie's life scattered around the room and over the chairs!They're the definition of opposite sides!But I couldn't imagine no one else better to mess up King's polos shirts and caqui pants!Their chemistry were amazing, their friendship and how incredible for each other they were just made this book an easy and fast read/listen.Queenie's relationship with the other wives and with Lavender deserves to be mentioned too! They're definitely an sanding group of friends and Bishop and Steve still owns my heart! 😂😂😂I loved all the cameos from previous characters and I'm over the moon with the news of Jake's book!
  🎧 About the Audiobook Narration... 🎧
I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Jason Clarke's narration, because although he have an incredible voice, it's always lacking in interpretation and emotion. It's flat and he looks like he's bored out of his mind. He shows more emotion when he's doing other character's voice, which isn't enough to me.Stella Bloom did it good in bringing all the right tones to the messy and funny Queenie!

Rumour has it you should look out for the quiet guys and Ryan Kingston certainly packs a few surprises. Queenie and King meet and hook up for one night , which is uncharacteristic for both of them. Fate intervenes and they end up meeting under very different circumstances six weeks later. When they realise who each other are , they also realise that they cannot be together. King is the goalie for Seattle's Ice Hockey Team and Queenie's dad is the GM and she is also her Dad's assistant so protocol dictates that these two should not have a relationship but the heart wants what the heart wants and this King wants his Queen...rules be damned.On the outside , King is a milk drinking, khakis wearing good guy. Always the peacekeeper, always impeccably behaved but behind closed doors, Queenie discovers Ryan has some serious moves and all that passion is bubbling just under the surface.  ""I took the Boy Scout out of the polo and unleashed a very dirty man.""King is an interesting Hero and not one I would normally gravitate to - I like an edgier Hero but Ryan really grew on me. His unwavering loyalty and his inherent kindness gave my kindle heart lots of squeezes. Plus...the man is pretty hot , he just needed a woman like Queenie to make him open up. He needed a shove in the right direction and the chemistry between these two is pretty much crackling off of the page.  “Lock the Boy Scout in the closet and let yourself off your leash, King.”Queenie is an excellent heroine. She wasn't badass , which was what I was expecting from the blurb. She was incredibly likeable and I really felt for her. She has had significant challenges and she does everything she can to overcome them. I loved the relationship between her and her Dad, Jake. (BTW, please let there be a book somewhere for Jake....) She is definitely the opposite of Ryan in many ways but at heart they are both loyal, kind and good people. She is artistic and messy whilst he is neat, orderly and drives under the speed limit. He knocks back milk. She shoots back White Russians. He needs someone to unleash the passion and she's the woman to do it. I was not as keen on King's family - especially his Mum. I liked Hanna very much and she was an interesting character. His brother and Mum were not so endearing. A lot of the rule obeying from King stems from the childhood expectations of his family and even though he's all grown up , his Mum still sees him as a boy. “Are you going through a rebellious phase?” “I’m thirty. I make seven million dollars a year, I live in a house that’s totally paid for, and I drive a Volvo. No, Mom, I’m not going through a rebellious phase.”Overall this was a really enjoyable story that had romance , passion , comedy and some angst. It pulled my heart strings and left me smiling and feeling happy. HEA? Yes, gorgeous. Cheating? No. ",21,2
