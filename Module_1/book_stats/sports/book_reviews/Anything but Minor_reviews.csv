35553325,Anything but Minor,Christy,"3,706",31500,5,"September 16, 2017","5 stars!!! Anything but Minor is one of those books that has it all. It’s laugh out loud funny, sweet, swoony and steamy. Nothing is better than finishing a book and thinking ‘I loved everything about this,’ and that’s exactly what I thought after I finished this book. AbM is a sports romance, a romantic comedy, and it has one of my favorite tropes- where the ‘nerdy’ girl gets the cool guy. Alice has left Ohio for a new adventure in beautiful Charleston, South Carolina. She is a pilot/flight instructor at a new place in Charleston. Alice truly is up for an adventure and wants to explore her new city. Which is how she meets minor league baseball player, Rafe Hembrey. Alice finds herself at a local baseball game sitting next to a woman named Dutch when she first sees Rafe play. She is enamored with him at first sight, and he notices her, too. Later when she goes for drinks at a local bar, Rafe is there. I would love to say these two hit it off from the start, but that wouldn’t be 100% truthful.Rafe ‘Bullet’ Hembery is a local sports star. He had his chance to go to the majors when he was younger, but he couldn’t take it. This is his year. This is the year everyone knows it will happen for him. This is not the year he needs to start a relationship. Rafe knows he needs to focus on his game, but how can he possibly do that with Alice around? Not only is she beautiful, but she’s smart, quirky and fun. Watching things progress between these two was so much fun. I loved the beginning moments where they’re just starting to get to know each other. I loved seeing their relationship grow into so much more than just fun and flirty friendship. I loved it all. Rafe and Alice’s love story was magical- and comical. I can’t count how many times I laughed during this story. It was so much more than just a funny book, though. I fell in love with these characters. And it wasn’t just the main characters. There were a plethora of side characters that were so fantastic and added so much to the story. Andy, Dutch, Kristina, Alice’s mom. Rafe Hembrey is a wonderful hero, but I can’t help but share my love for all things Alice. To me, she stole the show. Alice is a hoot. Her crazy antics made me laugh non-stop. I loved her addiction to google, 80’s movies and her nervous tendencies. She really went out of her comfort zone to try something new and I admired that about her. I truly loved her outlook on life and how she was determined to make every day her best day. Alice really is the best! With Anything but Minor, Kate Stewart proved that she really can write anything. Emotional stories, angsty books, erotica, and now- sports romance/comedy. I love all her books, but AbM is by far one of my favorites of hers. If you’re looking for a story to fall in love with that has the best heroine ever, a wonderful hero, and lots of laughs and love- this is one I highly recommend! ",192,66
35553325,Anything but Minor,✦❋Arianna✦❋,790,2494,4,"August 8, 2016","4.5 Stars!!If you haven’t read anything by this author, 'Anything but Minor' is the perfect book to start with. Kate’s Stewart’s storytelling really appeals to me, so when I heard her new book is not only an entertaining as hell read, but also a fantastic rom com, I just knew I had to get my hands on it. I love romantic comedies and Kate Steward delivered a perfect one – funny and steamy with two endearing characters and delightful dialogue and banter. 
  
    “This woman was insane, but the kind of insane you gravitated toward. There was nothing generic about her. She didn’t hold back on anything, not her wrath, her opinion, or her compliments, which she gave freely.”
  
Alice left Ohio and has moved to Charleston, South Carolina in search of a new life full of adventure. Growing up with a strict mother who kept her sheltered from all the great things, Alice is really looking forward to be free and live her own life. Wanting to try something new, Alice finds herself at a local baseball game for the local minor league team. There she meets Rafe, who seems to be attracted with Alice as much as she is with him. Rafe ‘Bullet’ Hembery is the local star pitcher. Years ago he had the chance to be in the major league team, but something happened and he missed the chance. This year, seems to be the lucky year for Rafe, the year when his biggest dream will come true. His fans know and he knows it as well, so he only has to stay focused. But is hard to stay focused when you’re around Alice. Rafe wants Alice is his bed and he makes it clear from the beginning, but Alice is not that type of girl who sleeps around. If at the beginning, Alice believes Rafe is an irresponsible womanizer, as she gets to know him better she realizes that there is more to Rafe than he lets on. Rafe knows now it’s not the perfect time for a relationship, but as he gets to know Alice better he finds out Alice is special, that she is funny, sweet and smart and perfect for him in every way. This was such a great read! It made me smile, laugh and swoon from the beginning until the end. What made this book enjoyable to me was the way the humor and steam were perfectly blend. I love this author’s sense of humor and strong relatable heroines as much as I love her swoon-worthy heroes. I loved Alice and Rafe individually and I loved them together. Alice was a fantastic heroine. She was smart, nerdy, quirky and really adorable and I honestly had a blast being in her head. I loved her personality, her cool job as a flight instructor, how courageous she was to move away and live her life on her own, the fact that she loved old 80’s movies and last, but not least her addiction to Google. I enjoyed how loud and opinionated she was at times and I absolutely loved how she lived her life - to the fullest. I have to say I appreciated the fact that she wasn’t naïve or immature in any way, even if she was in some way innocent. She could have easily been, but fortunately for me she wasn’t portrayed in such a way. 
  
    “I’m happy. For the first time in a long time, I’m happy. You showed me what it looks like and then you became a reason.”
  
Rafe was a great hero as well and I have to say I really liked the fact that he wasn’t portrayed as an asshole. He was sweet, friendly, thoughtful, considerate and overall I really liked him, but I wouldn’t have minded his character to be a little more developed.Alice and Rafe’s relationship development was fantastically done and it was without a doubt my favorite aspect of this story. Their relationship progressed naturally and I had such a great time being in their heads as they became more than friends. It was wonderful to witness the transition from friends to lovers between them. I loved the witty, entertaining dialogue between them, the sexual innuendos that made me grin so many times and all the sweet and sexy moments between them as the story unfolded. Trust me when I say it was very easy for me to fall in love with both of these characters. I mentioned above how steamy this story was…and yeah, it really was. The sexual encounters between Alice and Rafe were well written and so very sexy, maybe because the chemistry between them was palpable and so well done from the beginning. The cast of supporting characters were engaging, fantastically written as well and I’m so looking forward to read their own stories in the near future. All in all, 'Anything but Minor' was a wonderful romantic comedy. If you love quirky heroines, sweet and sexy heroes and delightful dialogue then you don’t want to miss this one! ",175,88
35553325,Anything but Minor,Patty ~ Wrapped Up In Reading Book Blog,"1,260",9898,5,"February 9, 2017","*****5++++++++++RAFE HEMBRY IS ALL MINE STARS*****{Beta Read}It was selfish of me to ask her to take me the way I was, with only the time I could give, but I wanted her in a way I could never explain, or try to. She had so much strength, so much ability. She was so fiercely independent at times I couldn't believe she could need anyone at all. But she trusted me, she looked out for me and when we were together I could feel her need for me. She was everything I'd ever wanted and never thought I would find in a woman.
  

  
So I happen to really love Kate Stewart to the moon and back. She's honestly the most genuine and beautiful person inside and out. And she's so FLIPPING HILARIOUS. I told her that she should try her hand at writing a RomCom and how I just love those and sports themed romances. Wouldn't you know she already had Anything But Minor in that brilliant and beautiful mind of hers!!!!!I 100% LOVED THIS BOOK TO PIECES!!!!!!! From beginning to end it was PERFECTION!! Kate has always been one of my favorite authors and is a very gifted and versatile writer, but I truly feel that ROMCOM is her niche!! This book is equivalent to a World Series win for Kate Stewart!! I laughed so hard and fell madly in love with RAFE HEMBRY!!!! Not only did Kate deliver a superb story but she also created one of the most loveable and unforgettable heroines I have come across to date. Alice Boyd was adorably geeky and quite the google search expert. I loved her exuberance and vivaciousness. She was always willing to try something new and I admired her for her courage to just pack up and move to a place where she had not one friend or family member there to support her. Alice lands a job at Boeing as a flight instructor in Charleston, South Carolina. She’s leaving her hometown and excited to be starting her new life. She decides to go on a little tour of the Downtown area and stumbles upon a flyer for an upcoming Swampgators baseball game. Little did she know that this flyer would change her life forever.Rafe Hembry is the up and coming star player for the Swampgators. Major League talent scouts have him on their radar. The moment he spots Alice in the stands, he feels an instant attraction and she definitely is awestruck at the sight of Rafe. Alice is quite the klutz and it’s almost a given that she will land herself in an embarrassing situation and oftentimes it happens whenever Rafe is around. The two become fast friends but always with the undercurrent of pure want between them. No matter how hard Rafe tries to seduce her, Alice is fearful that she will be just a passing fancy for him and she’d rather hold on to the friendship they share than to lose him to a moment of lust. But as time passes they both realize that there is something pretty special building between them and neither will be able to deny their attraction any longer.When Rafe and Alice give in to their burning passion for each other I may have felt myself about to combust from the explosive heat generated between them. Holy Hell, get ready to feel the earth move and bookcases fall!!! And once things start to get serious between them, I was a swooning mess!!This is a book to be savored and I promise you that the story hooks you in from the beginning and will have you laughing, panting, and maybe even shedding a few tears of joy when all is said and done. It is definitely a book that I will be revisiting quite often.If you’ve never read anything by Kate Stewart, I highly recommend that you start with this one right here. It’s the PERFECT summer read!!! ANYTHING BUT MINOR is available NOW!!!

35553325,Anything but Minor,Maria✦❋Steamy Reads Blog❋✦,662,2395,3,"August 26, 2016","➦This is a type of story that is certainly enjoyable to read but not very memorable. In fact, if I'm being honest, in a couple months time the only thing that I'll probably remember from this book will be the heroine who pisses herself when she gets nervous. The heroine here is entertaining and unique, that's for sure. ➦There is some fun banter and a couple of hot scenes... BUT WAIT! There's a big conflict here! How on earth can you be with someone who is about to be drafted into a major baseball league and make a shit ton of money? I mean, it's not like you are single and hate your job anyways and can relocate and may be find a different job closer to your super hot, super successful and super rich boyfriend the love of your life! Oh wait, that's exactly what you are. lol➦Will they figure it out in the end? I'm on stand by with a medal, in case they do.➦To sum it up, I liked the book but it was lacking angst for me. Or the reason behind so called angst. ",108,49

35553325,Anything but Minor,Alba and Her Secrets..♥,791,999,5,"June 25, 2017","5+ 'No end' Stars!
  
This is my first book by Kate Stewart, can you believe it? I saw a while ago many of my friends/bloggers raving about Anything but Minor. Many of them gave this novel high ratings and let me tell you, now I understand why. I ADORED every single word of this!Anything but Minor is the first installment of Kate's Balls in Play series and it tells the story of Rafe 'Bullet' Hembrey (the hot and funny minor league baseball player that is now at his best to take a step further in his career and things get interesting when ""Lesbian Alice"" turns his world upside down) and Alice Boyd (a nerdy young woman and flight instructor who is ready to have the world at her feet after having a very lonely life; little does she know how certain playboy will change everything for her..). 
  “I’m not sure what you want me to think of you, Rafe.” “I’m pretty sure I just want you to think of me, Alice.”
This book is the perfect rom com: it's extremely funny, smart and smoking hot! Anything but Minor starts with a very engaging plot: a sports romance where the nerdy girl gets the forever-playboy to fall in love with her. Rafe and Alice have an out-of-this-world chemistry, the sexual tension is there from the beginning and their dialogues are full of banter. As the movie junkie that I am, can I say I loved all the movie references? I can totally identify myself with Alice lol This is the perfect love story, with a great outline and incredible main and secondary characters.  
  There was just something about her I couldn’t shake. Maybe it was her innocence, her honesty, or maybe it was just her.“Don’t move. I’m going to take a shower and then undress you again.” “Okay.” “Wow, we made you agreeable, too.” “Stop referring to your junk as another entity, Rafe. It’s creepy.” “We’ll shut you up again soon.”
I loved that our protagonists started as friends and not directly as lovers. Obviously, the tension between them started the first moment they see each other but I really enjoyed how their relationship developed. They give us extraordinary moments together and when they finally have sex, OH MY GOD. The sex was absolutely amazing and off-the-charts hot! And when you mix that with super-funny moments and strong feelings getting involved? Even freaking better!
  “I, Alice Boyd.” “I, Alice Boyd.” “Do solemnly swear.” “Do solemnly swear,” I said in a dull monotone. “To praise the penis of Rafe Hembrey.”“To praise the penis of Rafe Hembrey.”“I promise to love, honor, and cherish his penis and only his penis.” “Are you serious right now?” “You called my penis Jake Ryan.” “It’s the highest of compliments, I swear.”“You were made for me. You fit me like a glove. I want you always to remember that.” He leaned in and sucked on my shoulder as his hot gaze burned me. “I love you. I love your body. I love being inside this pussy. You. Are. Everything. My everything.”
These two are so sexy and hilarious! And.. can I have Rafe Hembrey please? Pretty please? I am so in love/lust with this man, seriously! I love when a novel makes me fall in love with the characters and when it makes me feel every emotion possible and this did it for me: I laughed, I cried and I did everything in between too lol Anything but Minor is one of my favorite reads this year and my favorite comedy, for sure! I cannot wait for the next book!
  “What has gotten into you, Rafe Hembrey?” “I’m happy. For the first time in a long time, I’m happy. You showed me what it looks like and then you became a reason.”
Therefore, I am rating Anything but Minor with 5+ STARS: there was no single doubt that I would be rating it with my special 6 star rating because it definitely deserves it! I felt everything with this book, I loved the writing style and how Kate developed the plot and the love story! Who complains about that? Who complains about Rafe Hembrey and all the fantastic moments he gave us with Alice? Not me! So, of course, I highly HIGHLY recommend it!CHECK OUT MY BLOG HERE:

35553325,Anything but Minor,Pearl Angeli,622,942,4,"July 3, 2017","4 ""No End"" Stars!Many people will not read this book because of the cover lol. But I'm telling you guys, this book is so worth it! I enjoyed Anything but Minor and not just because it's a pretty guilty-pleasure book, but because it's just one of those stories that have the ability to steal my heart away.The story was told from each of the main characters' POV, pilot instructor Alice Boyd and Swampgator baseball pitcher Rafe Hembrey. Alice left her hometown and went to Charleston to ""stay away"" from her strict mom and basically live her life to the fullest. There, she met the sexy playboy baseball star Rafe who made it a point right after their first meeting that he was attracted to her and he wanted them to hook-up. Alice resisted him at first, but because Rafe was just too difficult to avoid, and because she promised a woman named Dutch to watch every Swampgator game, she soon fell for him.Their love story was so plain and simple and I still loved it. There's just something about Rafe and Alice's chemistry that is so addictive. I loved their push and pull relationship, the way they handled the obstacles around them, and how they became better persons even if their family was not perfect. Anything But Minor is a light-hearted, sexy New Adult sports romance that didn't fail to capture my heart from start to finish. Rafe was not a perfect male lead. At times he was being an asshole, but he was a redeemable character. Alice, on the other hand, was such a quirky character and she's the kind of person that I would really love to be friends with. NA fans, you don't want to miss this book!

35553325,Anything but Minor,Christie«SHBBblogger»,951,1223,5,"October 29, 2016","Title: Anything But MinorSeries: Balls in Play #1Author: Kate StewartRelease date:  July 15, 2016Cliffhanger: NoHEAYesI'm not gonna lie, this smokin' cover had a big part in convincing me to read this book. And don't even pretend that you didn't do a double take when you saw it. *cheesy grin* This is my first read by Kate Stewart believe it or not. I've been telling myself to check her work out for a while now, so when I saw this sports romance announced I jumped on it. Let me say right off the bat (no pun intended) that if you're looking for a fun rom-com with loads of steam then stop right here. This book delivers! Sexy, swoony, and infused with humor, this book is guaranteed to delight your senses.What was my favorite thing about this book? Alice. This. Woman. She walked onstage, stole the spotlight, and got a standing ovation from me. Why did I love her? Let me count the ways.She was intelligent. Not only was she extremely smart, but she was one of my favorite types of heroines: a nerd! She had a google addiction and liked to learn obscure facts on a daily basis. She loved old 80's movies and had a VHS collection of them that she watched an obsessed over. She was just a shade socially awkward and clumsy. Add up all of her quirks and she was one hot mess of fun.She respected herself. This was one of those kickass heroines that regularly put the cocky man who was used to getting his way in his place. She wasn't stupid enough to fall into his bed just because he told her a few practiced lines and flattered her. I lost count of how many times I sat back in shock and started laughing at how perfectly she owned him like a boss. And all he could do was keep coming back for more.She was a flight instructor! I love any book where the heroine works in a male dominated field, but I was especially loving the fact that she was a pilot. Overall, she was just this fascinating mix of contradictions and unique qualities. She had a fresh innocence and honesty to her that was so appealing. She said what was on her mind and what she wanted with no artifice. She may have been inexperienced because of her strict upbringing, but she was shedding all of her inhibitions, embracing life, and finding joy in every day. I'd been dying in a gray hell, longing for a taste of everything for as long as I could remember, and I would take a bite out of it all.Rafe is a pitcher in the Minor leagues and known for seeing women as nothing more than a temporary good time. His focus has always been on his career, and he's never found anyone that's made him re-think his stance on casual sex. When Alice comes to town and has a couple of embarrassing mishaps with him, he's drawn to her sweetness and straightforwardness. But all the attraction in the world won't convince her to be just another one of his women. I loved the fact that Alice and Rafe started out as friends. It forced him to get to know her at a deeper level and it was hilarious to see him trying to hide his true feelings and keep cool in front of her. The way their relationship naturally developed was highly entertaining, filled with sexy innuendo and naughty temptations. And to see them evolve into a deeper understanding of one another was a beautiful thing. She made him want to be the best version of himself that he could be to deserve her. The side story with Rafe's friends was well done, adding a hint of conflict and depth to the overall plot. I would love to see each of them get their HEA in the future! If this is an example of what Kate Stewart has to offer, than sign me up for every book she releases in the future. I was just that impressed and captivated with this!

She was so positive, active, full of energy, no pretence and no drama. I loved her. The relationship that developed between the leads was also unconventional if you're used to the traditional NA sports romance routine. This was an easy, feel good read but not so much that it borders on cheesy or that is feels superficial.Definitely a good surprise.",67,1 comment
35553325,Anything but Minor,Rachel Reads Ravenously,"1,787",2130,4,"July 16, 2016"," 4.5 stars!!! I always know one thing going into a Kate Stewart book: she's gonna leave me with a big old smile on my face.  ""I'm not sure what you want me to think of you, Rafe.""""I'm pretty sure I just want you to think of me, Alice.""  Anything But Minor is about a woman named Alice who has left Ohio to live in Charleston and has a new career as a flight instructor. Having been sheltered by her mother her entire life, Charleston is Alice's chance to live free and discover new things. On a whim, she attends a baseball game for the local minor league team where she meets Rafe, the star pitcher. Rafe makes it clear from the beginning he is interested in Alice, but Alice wants something more substantial than a fling. The two agree to be friends but there is an attraction between them that Rafe doesn't want to deny. ​  ""I may be wrong about you, I think. I thought you were one of those bone-headed, stupid athletes who only cared about baseball and women. But I have a feeling you're worth knowing.""  I really loved reading the progression of the relationship between Rafe and Alice, their adventures together and the little moments where they got to know each other. Alice is quirky and nerdy and I loved her. I loved that Rafe embraced her nerdiness and quirks, and he saw how her past made her the woman she was. Rafe, he was quite the hero. Friendly, strong, and determined, I also loved that he was a big dude! Cause I like my alpha males and all. The side characters are a delightful cherry on top and I am dying to see them again. I really want to see more from Kristina as I adored her friendship with Alice. The VHS tapes at the beginning of the chapters were another awesome touch to the book, in fact this entire book just made me want to sit down and watch 80's movies.Another great book from Kate Stewart and I look forward to what's to come!

35553325,Anything but Minor,Stacey,"1,447",1162,5,"November 18, 2016","Do you trust me?Well…do you trust me? I’m sure you’re all saying…sure Sassy, in a very superficial (here she goes again with her dribble about who knows what) way. Do you think we hear “Do you trust me?” – or- “Don’t you trust me?” too much? Are we handing over our trust without thought? Do we know a pilot before we board a plane and whether that man or woman deserves our trust? Or the driver in the car behind who may or may not have had enough sleep? I think we’ve stopped trusting in some respects and moved it to hope. We hope that the pilot/driver is deserving of the trust we put in them. I think trust must be earned. Trust should come after a person has seen you at your best and been proud to know you. Seen you at your nastiest and trusted that you’ll eventually get over yourself. Seen you nervous and held your hand. The person who wipes your tears and gives you a hug even if the tears are only there because the navy blue handbag you’d been eyeing for months has sold out and is discontinued. The person I trust the most earned it because he can keep a straight face while I tell him about cockroaches with spray tans, love at first sight, ""vegetarian"" vampires, motorcycle men with soft spots and even Scottish highland lairds who find a wee lassie to wrap in his kilt. That's not the only reason why I trust my hubby, he's earned it in hundreds of ways on hundreds of days. Luckily my hubby loves me even if I am a book nerd…or maybe it’s because. Ok, I did it again…I went off on a tangent that has practically nothing to do with the storyline…but it kind of does. How do you trust your heart to someone you think is too good for you or way out of your league? In Anything but Minor both the hero and the heroine have to learn to trust the feelings that have developed between them. When you’re looking at a woman who sets your heart alight, makes every day your best and thinks you are the best thing since sliced bread…how do you live up to that? When you’re looking at a man who has the opportunity of a lifetime away from you…how do you trust that he’s thinking about you as much as you’re thinking about him? Anything but Minor gets right to the heart of trusting someone and knowing whether you’ve put that trust in the right person.You won’t believe this (after all that heavy stuff I just spouted) but this book is by far one of the funniest books I’ve read this year. More than once I had tears pouring out of my eyes I was laughing so hard. The main chick in this book, Alice is an absolute crack up. She is on a mission to make every day the best day of her life. After growing up in a house with a bitter, self-righteous single mother, Alice has had enough and decides to take a job in a different town to spread her wings. She wants to experience all the things she’s been too scared to try in fear that God will strike her down for wicked thoughts. Alice has been lonely up till now and with this new move she wants to meet new people and have new adventures. When looking for her next adventure she ends up at a ball park watching her first game of baseball. The pitcher is awesome and she can’t believe it when she meets him at a bar afterwards…and completely humiliates herself.Rafe can’t believe this woman. She’s an absolute cutie and he wants her in a bad way. The things she does and says crack him up and make him feel things but he’s just about to get signed up for the majors and can’t afford to split his attentions. He tries to talk her into having a short term relationship aka a “quickie” but she wants no bar of him. Well, doesn’t she look a lot more appealing all of a sudden? He realises pretty quickly that he doesn’t want the short term relationship anymore, he wants every day to be their best day together.Kate Stewart has again given us a brilliant story. Anything but Minor is funny, sweet, steamy and heartwarming. This was another story where my boys had to know why I'm laughing so hard? My oldest who is 13 does the whole, rolling his eyes...knowing it's a love story so it can't be THAT funny. My nearly 10-year-old doesn't have the eye rolls but he does have the thong ready to wack cockroaches that have snuck in and are really funny. Of course, hubby knew there was no way I'd be laughing if there was a cockroach in my bedroom. It’s not all fun and it’s not all serious, it’s a wonderful blend of both that left a smile on my face and my heart fluttering. This story is a winner…cockroaches with fake tans and all.To buy Anything but Minor from Amazon - http://amzn.to/29ElkUMI’m an Aussie chick who loves to read and review romance, drink coffee, be a Style Setter and stalk David Gandy.

35553325,Anything but Minor,NMmomof4,"1,479",3483,4,"July 27, 2017"," 4 StarsOverall Opinion:  This was a super sweet, funny, and sexy read. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Initially, I had thought this was a erotic short story just by looking at the cover. It's a hot picture, but not normally what we see on a contemporary full length romance. I know, I know -- I am a judgy person ;). This doesn't get all that deep, but it served its purpose in making me happy while reading it. I'd definitely recommend for in-between some heavier reads!Brief Summary of the Storyline:  This is Alice and Rafe's story. Alice is new to town, and ends up at a minor league baseball game where she is befriended by an older woman. This woman ends up giving her a season seat, so she is thrown into the new sport. She finds herself at a pub that is owned by one of the players, and she meets Rafe who is the star pitcher. Sparks fly instantly, but Alice has stereotyped him as a manwhore (which wasn't far off) and isn't interested in a ONS. There is some pursuing going on, a friendship is formed, and then they get together and fall in love....and they eventually get a HEA ending.POV: This alternated between Alice and Rafe's POV.Overall Pace of Story:  Good. I never skimmed and I thought it flowed well.Instalove: No. They take a while to develop stronger feelings.H rating: 4 stars. Rafe. I liked him. I took a little bit to come around to liking him, but I ended up really liking his relationship with the h and how he treated her.h rating: 4 stars. Alice. She was super cute in her Google obsession. I especially loved it when they were going to his house to have sex for the first time and she is googling ways to blow his mind! Too cute.Sadness level: Low. No tissues needed.Push/Pull: Yes  The h doesn't want to be a ONS and appreciates the H's friendship, so she makes him work for her and pushes away a little. The H does a little pushing away at one point, but it doesn't last long and he ends up coming around. Heat level: Moderate. They have some steamy scenes and chemistry.Descriptive sex: YesSafe sex: Yes. Condoms are mentioned and then after a std status and birth control talk they go without. I don't remember any mention of past practices.OW/OM drama: Very mild  There is a bartender at the H's best friend's bar that has a thing for the H. She becomes friends with the h, but she never creates any drama with the h and H. The H and the OW have no sexual/romantic past.Sex scene with OW or OM: NoCheating: NoSeparation: No  They're only separated when the H is at away games. No mention or suggestion of other partners during this separation.Possible Triggers: Mild  Manwhore H before h and neglectful/controlling parents.Closure:  This actually had some good closure with a cute jump ahead epilogue and a HEA ending! Just what I like ;)How I got it: I paid the $2.99 on Amazon.Safety: I'd say that this should be Safe for most readers.- Does Not have cheating- Does Not have a descriptive sex scene with OW/OM-  Does have the H pushing the h away a little bit-  Does Not have a separation between the h and H (except when he leaves to play games, but they're still together)-  Does Not have abuse-  Does Not have OTT sad parts- Does  have a HEA ending",64,29

  Anything But Minor
 is Kate Stewart's latest offering. After reading and enjoying 
  Loving The White Liar
 (We even get a brief cameo of the couple of that book in this one) I knew that I had to add this book to my neverending ""TO-READ"" list...
  ""The woman had managed to piss me off twice since I met her and had made a fool of me. Oh yes, there would be fucking""
Alice left Ohio and her mother's overbearing attitude to strike out on an adventure and finally be the Alice she was meant to be. Everyday she discovers something new, which leads her to a baseball game and Dutch. Mistakenly sitting in Dutch's dead husband's seat a friendship is built which leads her to one sexy as sin pitcher Rafe Hembrey. Rafe is a bit of a playboy and not someone Alice dares to get involved with. Alas, fate has other plans and soon the sparks are flying between these two....
  ""Well, have faith, Rafe. If a fourteen-inch seahorse can be monogamous, I’m sure there’s hope for you.""
 I enjoyed this one a lot. Alice was one of the best heroine's I have read in AGES. She was funny, and quirky (without being annoying) She had self respect and didn't just fall into Rafe's crotch the minute he said ""hello"" She really made the book for me. Rafe I liked a little less than Alice. It took me a little time to warm to him. He was a player, and to be honest I am getting a little tired of the whole ""sports hero player gig"" that seems to be in almost EVERY sports romance written lately. As much as I did enjoy this one, it did lose a star and a half for a few issues I had. There is a scene that annoyed me that involved another woman. Normally I don't concern myself with wondering about things that don't happen on the actual pages of the book (why bother right? If it was important to the story it would be included) That said there is a scene where Rafe leaves Alice to apparently go play ""naked poker"" with a woman whose ass he slapped earlier in front of Alice. The reason why I felt we needed clarification on whether he went back and played with the OW or not was because he was trying to present a non-player facade to Alice and if he did indeed go and play naked poker than he loses some points in my eyes for continuing his player ways while claiming to want Alice. Another thing that made NO SENSE to me was the whole ""Kristina"" situation. Until 80% of the book I never got an inkling that she was in love with Rafe. Even when her and Alice have a conversation about Rafe and whether they have ever slept together, she says she is hung up on ""someone else"" Even when Andy was angry at Rafe because he has a thing for Kristina, I was SURE she was in love with someone different and Andy was wrong. In FACT I actually thought she was in love with Andy. Then BAM, at 80% she is declaring these feelings of love. It just seemed SO unnecessary since she was Alice's friend and never caused any tension or trouble over the course of the book. I honestly am still scratching my head over the whole point of that plotline. Lastly the whole revelation about Dutch was a little too out of left field for me. I mean one would think SOMEONE would have brought it up before the very end of the book. I am not sure why it needed to be this big secret.So I know it sounds like a had a lot of problems with this one, but all those mentioned above where just annoyances in the big picture. I really did enjoy this one, and I really do enjoy this authors writing. I laughed my butt off SO many times. A hearty two thumbs up...",60,48
35553325,Anything but Minor,Dee Montoya,942,571,5,"July 14, 2016","*****5+++~Be Mine Stars(ARC kindly provided by author <3)Laugh out loud and utterly fantastic. Anything But Minor was everything I've been craving and much more. Kate Stewart has proven once again that not only is she a talented author but that she's also damn funny too!!This book delivered nothing but a good time! A total home run of a book!!!! 
  
Alice left her hometown behind and has moved to Charleston, South Carolina in search of a new life full of adventure. She grew up with a mother who was very strict and kept Alice sheltered from most things in life. Now Alice is ready to break free, with a wonderful list in hand of new things she wants to try.From the moment Alice steps down from the airplane, she starts to fall in love with Charleston, and we go along with her. The beautiful setting is so enchanting, it makes you want to hop on a plane, and go visit. In the spirit of trying new things, Alice finds herself at a local baseball game, where a strange older woman offers her a weekly seat to watch the games of their home team with her. And it is at that ballgame where Alice gets mesmerized by the most beautiful man she's ever seen; Rafe Hembrey. 
  
This is Rafe's year, the year he's been waiting for to sign with a major league team. His stats are better than ever, his career at its' peak, and everyone knows that sooner or later he's getting that call. Which is why he can't afford to get distracted by the bombshell/nerd/ Google obsessed woman he just met at one of his games. Alice knows Rafe has a reputation of love 'em and leave 'em, and she also knows that he might be leaving Charleston soon. So, after a few friendly dates, and even though the attraction is out of control intense between them, Alice decides she'd rather not lose Rafe's friendship since she knows all she can get from him is amazing sex. But Rafe has other plans, he wants in Alice's pants, but every minute he spends with her, makes him realize that he might actually want more.This story was as sweet and decadent as eating a chocolate cake, but without feeling guilty about the calories. The characters, the hilarious plot, and the setting made a magical combination that will charm the hearts of anybody who reads it.Rafe was sexy and delicious, but Alice was my most favorite thing about this book. Her character was totally adorable, smart and also very empowering, we need more female characters like her in books. Anything But Minor is a book that will leave you feeling happy. A book that you would want to share, gift and recommend, because it's so full of laughs and soul. This book is one item I'll have on my Christmas list to give to all my friends. I just LOVED it!!!

35553325,Anything but Minor,Maida»-(¯`v´¯)-»,"1,666",421,5,"August 28, 2016","RATING: 5+ “No end” Hearts!! :D <3Anything But Minor is an easy, enjoyable read, giving us two equally quirky protagonists who bring a number of laugh out loud moments with their banter and a romance that combines the best of sweet and sexy as it transitions from friendship to intimacy.
  
     “You could really fuck me up, Rafe.”He only hesitated a second before he promised me, “I’ve got you.”“I’ve got you, too.” 
  
Alice makes us fall in love with her the moment she steps on page, a scene-stealer with her love of 80’s movies and penchant to Google everything that piques her interest. Though her strict upbringing kept her from experiencing the rambunctiousness that comes with being a teenager, she still somehow emerges with the ability to approach every situation in her adulthood with a joy for life we can only admire. She holds her head up high even when her new adventurous nature lands her in unexpected—albeit comical—predicaments time and again.
  
     She had a way of making me feel...everything, and not in small doses, but all at once. 
  
Rafe is everything a swoon-worthy sports romance hero should be; loyal, self-assured, and completely possessive, ensuring we’re as much impassioned by his determined seduction as is Alice. While he would have many a single lady clamoring for his attention, he only has eyes for Alice even when she continuously rejects his efforts to make her fall into his bed. While the romance is of the slow burn variety, we’re thankfully spared chapters of angst, instead Ms. Stewart allows us to sit back and simply enjoy their friendly flirtation and sexy come-ons until reaching the precipice of their sexual tension. 
  
     “I think you’re the most beautiful man on the planet. I think you’re a superior athlete. I think you play dumb a lot to keep from having to explain yourself. I think you’re passionate and considerate. I think you’re an amazing lover. I think you’re all heart on the ballfield and have a guarded heart off it...I think you’re incredible, Rafe Hembrey.” 
  
Overall, Anything But Minor is the kind of romance that brings a smile to our faces as much as it does a blush to our cheeks, anchoring both longtime readers of Kate Stewart and those new to her work (like myself) as eternal fans.Other Fave Quotes:“I’m not sure what you want me to think of you, Rafe.”“I’m pretty sure I just want you to think of me, Alice,” he said in a whisper.“If you keep waiting, baby, I’ll keep coming home.”“I’ve got you.”“I fucking love you.”“The world could disappear tomorrow and I’d only worry about a fucking tiny list of people. But the thing I would need in order to breathe again would be to see your face.”“Best day of my life.”“Every day.”“You were made for me. You fit me like a glove. I want you to always remember that.”“You. Are. Everything. My everything.”“Rafe?”“Yeah?”“Why me?”“It could only be you.”
