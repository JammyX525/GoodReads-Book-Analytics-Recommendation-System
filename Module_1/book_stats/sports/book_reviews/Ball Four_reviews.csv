762563,Ball Four,Will Byrnes,"1,284",11900,5,"May 27, 2021","This is one of the seminal shoot-beaver-and-tell books. It opened up the field for sportswriters to come and got Bouton into a fair bit of trouble. It is a must-read for its look at the Yankees of Mantle and Maris days, showing them as the very human people they were. A classic of it's genre.

762563,Ball Four,Theo Logos,586,88,5,"October 24, 2022","Ball Four is the perfect baseball book, the best ever written about the game. This fact gets lost among all the chatter of how ground breaking, taboo shattering, and transformative it was for sports writing. All that is true. But that is all incidental to the fact that Ball Four is the best, most perfect baseball book ever. Ball Four has it all. Jim Bouton began his career as a fireballing young pitcher for the New York Yankees near the end of their unprecedented 18 year long (1947-1964) stretch of absolute dominance of the game. He was an exciting, rising young star on World Series teams, and counted legends like Mickey Mantel and Whitey Ford among his friends and teammates. He participated at the pinnacle of the game. That’s in Ball Four. But Bouton blew out his arm with his fastball, and fell from baseball grace. He had to relearn how to pitch — reinvented himself pitching the tricky, unpredictable knuckleball. And instead of the Yankees dynasty, he had to make his comeback pitching for the lowly expansion team, The Seattle Pilots — a team so benighted, so doomed, that it lasted only a single baseball season. Instead of teammates legends like Mantle and Ford, he now played with guys named Gene Brabender and Jim Gosger. Instead of a brash, rising star, he had become a washed up journeyman trying desperately to hang on pitching for baseball’s worst team. That’s in Ball Four too. From dynasty to gulag, legends to jokes, star to washout — Jim Bouton encompassed the whole gamut of baseball experience. It’s all here in this remarkable book. The uproar he caused by writing honesty about the game — the salty language, hard drinking, womanizing, pill-popping — made the book’s legend, but Bouton’s experiences and the passion and humor with which he recorded them is what makes it truly great.",16,6
762563,Ball Four,John,71,7,5,"August 4, 2011"," Ball Four might be the greatest baseball book ever written! Correction, Ball Four might be the greatest sports book ever written. What Bouton accomplished with Ball Four was to tear the cover off of professional sports by exposing the tangled core underneath the canned responses to interviews, the hagiography of sports heroes, and the mundane existence of living out of a suitcase for six months. The haloed Yankees hated this book as it painted their hero Mickey Mantle as less than a shining light, the fans didn't care for that either. Players thought it broke the sacred bonds of The Team.  But Bouton was always an iconoclast; he cared and fought for what he thought was fair pay long before the free agent era, he talked to reporters in thoughtful conversations, and he took notes. After Bouton blew out his arm for the Yankees he reinvents himself as a knuckleball pitcher and gets called up to a new franchise, the Seattle Pilots. Filled with castoffs and fringe players the Pilots are the perfect team for Bouton to chronologically capture daily life in major league baseball.  Funny, wry, and reflective daily recordings from a man with one last gasp of glory left in his arm, and it's not by throwing the baseball. What Bouton deftly does is invite you in on the difficulties and the absurdity, the grind and the goofy, the stoic and the bored. This is best read as following a baseball season, one day at a time. You can relive a team's infamous one year season daily as told by a true voice from the inside. ",15,2
762563,Ball Four,Tim,124,49,3,"August 18, 2021","When Jim Bouton was 24 year old pitcher for the New York Yankees in 1963 in his first full season, he went 21-7 with a 2.53 ERA and won a World Series. He then had another great year, winning 18 games and another World Series appearance. Bouton even won 2 games in the World Series that year. If you are into advanced statistics, through his age 25 year he had 8.0 Wins Above Replacement. But his fastball velocity went down and he was no longer very effective after this. For the rest his career, across seven seasons, he totaled -0.5 Wins Above Replacement. Meaning, he was a marginal player, probably not any better than someone the team could have called up from their AAA squad. Ball Four is the story of his 1969 season, where he decided to become a knuckleball pitcher to compensate for his lost velocity and attempt to resuscitate his fading baseball career.This book is also known as the first baseball autobiography to spill the tea on what went on in the clubhouse and hotels. I’ve already read many baseball autobiographies, as by now it seems like every player writes a gossipy tell-all. So, the book didn’t really have the same shock value from the raunchiness, drinking, and silly pranks as it would have when it first came out. But I can relate – I still remember the first baseball autobiography I read, when I was about 12: Balls by Graig Nettles. I was really fascinated by all the behind the scenes craziness. The Wrong Stuff by Bill Lee was another of my favorites. The humor in Ball Four didn’t always land with me. The stories about players being peeping toms, for instance, doesn’t age well and seems really creepy now. But it is what happened.I did enjoy the way Bouton would skewer players and coaches that used meaningless cliches. Bouton has a questioning and analytical mind, and it was funny the way he could sometimes expose the daftness of the “conventional wisdoms” of the day. If he played in the age of advanced analytics, I would bet he would be open and curious to learning about it. Bouton also saw through the owner’s bullshit about how they weren’t making any money and how competitive balance would be destroyed if players were granted free agency rights. In Bouton’s day, unless you were a star, the money wasn’t much better than middle class wages. This might still seem good, but given how short player careers are, along with the fact that they might be entering the “real” labor force as a 30 year old without any useful job skills, it’s not that much.Bouton was also the first to expose how players used “greenies” (amphetamines) to boost performance. It was incredibly common; the way Bouton tells it most players used it. It is interesting that there is a lot of moralizing about players using steroids, but not many seem bothered by amphetamines.While the book is more known for the gossipy off-field stuff, it was the baseball parts I enjoyed best. I liked getting a better understanding of what the game was like: how players thought about strategy, what they thought about during the games, how their performance was evaluated. That's what made it a worthwhile read for me.",13,N/A

762563,Ball Four,Larry Bassett,"1,383",293,4,"October 4, 2021","I should really give this book 5 stars strictly for the nostalgia that it represents for me. And for the fact that the audible version is actually read incredibly sincerely by the author Jim Bouton. His feeling and intensity and occasionally his emotions come through clearly. That is genuinely a very positive part of this book.I was surprised to find that this book was first published in 19 70 in someways it seems like a part of my childhood rather than a part of my 20s. But many of the players and the fact that the Detroit Tigers are mentioned frequently are in fact a part of my youth as I grew up a tiger and baseball fan.This book describes baseball players in a way that is not particularly laudatory. They seem to be crude and profane and sexually promiscuous as well as sexist. There is locker room talk as was more recently made famous by another character named Mr. Trump. This book somewhat trashed the hallowed halls of baseball. And the author paid a price for that.3/4 of this book is the original Ball Four. And the last quarter of the book or additional reflections from years later. Again, what made this book famous or maybe infamous is a better word is that it did not lionize the sports heroes of the 1960s and 1970s. You would like to think maybe that the world of sports described in this book is a thing of the past. But the only thing of the past from this book is the relatively paltry amount of money that even the sports stars earned back then.",9,1 comment
762563,Ball Four,Christopher,169,36,5,"August 3, 2021","”He has written ... a book deep in the American vein, so deep in fact that it is by no means a sports book ... As the book is deeply in the American vein, so is the reaction to it. The sportswriters are not judging the accuracy of the book, but Bouton's right to tell (that is, your right to read), which is, again, as American as apple pie ...”—David Halberstam, writing for Harper's magazine, ca. 1970.Jim Bouton’s Ball Four is one of the all-time classic baseball books, and it only took until my mid 50s to arrive at reading it. I grew up with this book in our house—my father owned and read it when it originally came out in 1970, and now I know that I couldn't possibly have appreciated it as a kid. This is a book squarely for adults ... although one could question whether it's entirely about adults.In the spring of 1969, Jim Bouton was a 30-year-old former New York Yankees pitcher whose best years were getting further and further behind him. His fastball was fading, and so was his sore pitching arm. He decided to document his 1969 season while he worked on a knuckle ball that he hoped might resurrect his career in the major leagues.The book is raucously funny in the early chapters. There are a number of good stories of Bouton's years with the Yankees. It notably lifts the mask from Mickey Mantle's superhero mystique and makes him into one of the guys—which isn't really a bad thing. Yankee fans especially howled at the sacrilege, but Mantle's larger than life reputation was unharmed. (Mantle’s drinking would do far more damage to his reputation—and his life—years later.)I've read a fair number of baseball books, some of them pretty funny, but none of them are as hilarious as this—Bouton has a comic’s sense of timing. And no other baseball book was as brutally honest as this. Bouton tells hard truths—about player behavior, drinking, drug use (greenies, aka amphetamines), chasing women, road life, and about himself, as well.And perhaps most importantly, it's about organizational behavior and the divisions within American society. This is why David Halberstam was right to say it's not about sports. It's about people and the way they treat each other. It's about owners and managers treating their employees like dirt, making kneejerk decisions based in legacy thinking. You can learn a lot about how not to deal with employees from this book. Passive aggressive behavior abounds. Progressive ideas are actively, bitterly discouraged. Bouton and fellow pitcher Mike Marshall are ostracized as weirdos by their teammates because they're perceived as smart. There's a palpable anti-intellectual undercurrent—something that continues to persist throughout our country.The regular season begins, and Bouton lasts only two games with the expansion Seattle Pilots before being sent to the Vancouver minor league team. After a few weeks he returns to the major league club, but the team is reluctant (to put it mildly) to use him as a starter. Bouton is continually frustrated by the team's stubbornness. The knuckle ball is just too weird for the old timers. The writing reflects Bouton's mood—we see little of the levity of the book's first quarter. He eventually appears in 57 games for the Pilots, exclusively in middle relief, with almost no innings in critical situations—his help to the club is largely off the scoresheets.And then there's something like a miracle—Bouton is dealt to the Houston Astros, a better team that is fighting for the lead in the National League West. The team's leadership seems more open minded than the dinosaurs in Seattle, and the players are more optimistic about their future. Bouton’s mood improves, and we start to see his humor again in the last third.The emotional high point of the book occurs when Bouton gets his first start of the season with Houston against the Pittsburgh Pirates. He pitches well, hangs in for ten innings, giving his team a chance at winning, only to lose the game on a seeing eye line shot in the 10th. This is the book's climax, a juxtaposition of a personal victory in the face of defeat. He was finally the warrior in the arena, something he worked all season for. For Bouton it's a triumph, the pinnacle of his season—he is elated that he pitched well, and the loss is negligible by comparison. He called his wife and his siblings to share his joy, and with this story, the book achieved the right closure.Bouton was effectively excommunicated from the major leagues the following year, due to the revelations shared in Ball Four. It is especially telling that MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn tried (unsuccessfully) to bully Bouton into signing a statement disavowing the book—something that said more about Kuhn and the baseball establishment than about Jim Bouton.Ball Four is a peek behind the curtain of the Great and Powerful Oz of major league baseball. I forget who said it, but there's an idea about the press that their job is to report things that authorities don't want told. And while I don't entirely agree with that view, Ball Four certainly makes it ring very true. It told uncomfortable truths about baseball that needed to be said. It remains one of the game's enduring works.",8,2
762563,Ball Four,Kathy Hay,12,3,5,"April 19, 2014","I'm not a baseball fan, but early this year I heard a brief interview with Jim Bouton and there was something about him that caught my attention - perhaps his voice (you can hear his smile in his voice), perhaps it was his word choice or maybe it was his humor. Regardless, something got to me and I sought out this book. I had a choice between reading it and listening and, because it was read by the author, I opted to get the audiobook.Ball Four is only superficially a book about baseball and you don't need to understand or love baseball to get this book. Ball Four is a coming of age story ... about an adult and for an adult. Bouton is a superb storyteller and observer, but he is also philosopher, a pundit, a prankster and a child. The book at first seems like diary entries or a series of vignettes, but all of a sudden you find you are immersed and entwined in the life of a very special, yet very human, man. For me baseball was just a framework for the story of a man growing into another man over the period of 30 years. Bouton first opens his mind to the readers, and then he opens his heart - his hopes, fears, dreams, moments when he is great and moments when he is flawed. I laughed (a lot), and I cried (in a good way), and going through Jim Bouton's journey made me a little less scared and a lot more accepting of my own journey.Jim's narration is as revealing as his writing and I encourage you to try this as an audiobook but I finished it only to run out and buy a hard copy so I could someday enjoy this book at a slower pace and linger... this is a book I will recommend to friends over and over.Given the book is on multiple ""the best lists"" I can't imagine how I missed it all these years. I consider this books one of my top 100 books... a desert island book... and one I know that I will read again and again.",8,N/A
762563,Ball Four,Dan Witte,72,7,5,"June 10, 2022","I love baseball like I love life, and I love this baseball book above all others. I’ve read it at least three times, and re-read parts of it many more times, and I never get tired of it. Jim Bouton deserves to be considered one of our greatest writers, in my opinion, and this one of our greatest American books.",7,9
762563,Ball Four,MacK,591,192,4,"April 27, 2009","Sad to say, baseball nut that I am, this book stayed below my radar for years on end, when it finally became a known quantity in my life as a fan I viewed it as something rather like Great Expectations definitely on the reading list, just waiting for you to tackle it and be stunned.However, rarely does the book live up to the hype. I fully expected a gripping story full of mystery and wonder, wit and grace, evocative prose reliving the highs and lows of a season on the road. And in the course of the novel Bouton certainly does have his moments of exalted eloquence, the single sentence: ""sometimes I forget to tingle"" alone is worth the read.Yet, most of the book is mundane, filled with the quotidian events in a season as a ballplayer. It's 162 games, it's months and months of your life, it's tiring, exhausting, spirit-crushing work (particularly if you're anything less than the greatest player ever), and Bouton chronicles that part of the season masterfully. The locker room banter, the minor fracases and major feuds, the games they play, the haggling with owners and executives, the women--my god--the women. And while much of the book is full of inside jokes, there's enough to amuse anyone and several insightful observations about the growing sentiment of anti-intellectualism in the 1960s. (Best of all, he hates the Yankees, how can any baseball fan (other than Yankees fans) not love the book when he hates the Yankees so much.)While I prefer my baseball literature in a more compelling, dramatic vein, I do appreciate the subtle graces and easy pleasures of a season with a washed up knuckle-ball pitcher with absurd philosophies and good dose of charm.

762563,Ball Four,Tim Bernhardt,32,2,4,"July 19, 2007","Whenever you want to complain about how much baseball players are making, read this book about the times during the reserve clause when owners owned the rights to players in perpetuity. Jim Bouton was a young fireballer who was used as piece of meat by the Yankees then discarded a few seasons later when he blew out his arm. ""Ball Four"" follows his story a few years after that, when he is desperately trying to keep his major league career going by developing a knuckleball, a pitch his old-school manager and coaches distrust. The year is 1969, the team is the failed experiment that is the Seattle Pilots, and the hero is not the guy who wins the big game, but the guy who is filling out the roster. Bouton describes the game from a different point of view than what can be gleaned from the box scores or observed from the grandstand. In the clubhouse, brains and ballplayers don't mix, management treat players more like inventory than people, and the worst thing you can do is question any of it. Suffice to say, it's the perfect analogy for corporate drudgery. ",6,N/A
762563,Ball Four,Fred Shaw,562,42,4,"April 25, 2017","""Ball Four"" is the April Baseball Book Club selection, author is Jim Bouton.Jim Bouton played professional baseball as a pitcher from 1962 to 1970. It's unheard of to have a pitcher play for that long, because of eventual and certain damage to a throwing arm. He played with and against some of the great players of the time: Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Elston Howard, Stan Musial, Whitey Ford and lots more. The reason he lasted so long in the game was because of his one great pitch, the knuckleball. The throwing motion for this pitch does not wreak havoc on your arm the way 100 mph fastballs, curves and sliders do. His book made him a legend among fans, but a pariah among some fellow players, coaches, team owners and last but not least, the commissioner of baseball, Bowie Kuhn. Every day he wrote in a journal about what happened during games, in the locker room, on buses to the next game, at hotels, etc. He told stories about players partying habits and their nocturnal excursions. He wrote about salary negotiations and trades. Not being on the receiving end, I didn't see the harm. I thought the stories were hilarious. Ball Four is written like a diary with some anecdotes and memories. The end of the book discusses his times and travels after playing. He was a sportscaster for example and entrepreneur. He met Ted Turner who gave a come back shot at playing again in th Atlanta Braves organization, and he did well pitching in his late thirties. He also discusses the aftermath of the book and how players would not speak to him. I enjoyed this part of the book best. He tells too of his personal life, divorce and the tragic loss of his beautiful 30 yr. old daughter, Laurie.Jim Bouton's ""Ball Four"" is one of the most widely read books on Baseball. Any sports fan would enjoy it. ",5,N/A
762563,Ball Four,Tung,623,38,2,"July 4, 2017","It’s impossible for me to properly rate this book, I think, because one of the lenses that impact a review is the context in which the book is released and its cultural significance. And because I am reading this book nearly fifty years after its publication, I don’t have the immediate impact of its release, although it is not hard for me to imagine. Bouton was a major league pitcher for several teams, most notably the Yankees. Ball Four is a running diary of his 1969 baseball season with the expansion Seattle Pilots (now Brewers) and Houston Astros. By this point in his career, Bouton had lost his fastball and was trying to pitch as a knuckleballer. Bouton chronicles his spring training experience, his feelings when he is sent to the minors, his joy and frustration with pitching for the Pilots in sporadic relief situations, his emotions when he is traded to the Astros, and his ongoing frustration with various aspects of professional baseball (salary negotiations, the inequity of power between owners and players, life on the road, etc). Reading this book in 2017 in the age of selfies, paparazzi, social media and me-first millennials, and all I see is another individual broadcasting the minutiae of his life to the world in a display of narcissism. While Instagram allows us today to see what a star athlete ate for dinner, when this book was released in 1970, it gave the reader an unprecedented look into private lives. Even more, while today we know all of the foibles of our athletes, in 1969, athletes were still hero worshipped and idealized. Ball Four revealed ballplayers to be drunks and adulterers and drug-users (particularly amphetamines), which stunned the sensibilities of those who considered baseball and its players sacrosanct. No wonder Bouton was blackballed from baseball for so long. Understanding the cultural impact of this book, however, did not improve my opinion of it – which is to say, I did not enjoy reading it. First, in 1969, Bouton scribbled notes and observations throughout the day as they occurred to him, and the prose reads like it. Each sentence and paragraph was often completely disconnected from the preceding sentence or paragraph. This read very much like a running diary, which is to say, full of non-sequiturs, and too ADD for my tastes. Secondly, I side with the many players who held decades-long grudges towards Bouton for what they perceived as Bouton’s betrayal of their confidence. Bouton shares the names of players and the conversations they had with each other about hooking up with groupies, or grooving a pitch to allow another player to end the season with a .300 batting average. These private conversations between teammates is absolutely NOT something you share without their knowledge or consent – especially when it’s released so soon after such conversations actually occurred. If Bouton had written a memoir thirty years later and shared stories that would not harm his teammates so long after the incidents occurred, that’s one thing. But to share conversations about adulterous dalliances in practically real-time? Unforgivable. My feelings towards Bouton certainly affected how I felt reading through the book. Thirdly, in the version of the book I read, it included “Ball Five”, “Ball Six”, and “Ball Seven” – essentially epilogues that were included in later editions where Bouton shared more recent musings about reactions to his book and updates on the lives of the players mentioned in the book. And in much of these epilogues, Bouton uses these sections to self-righteously justify his actions. These sections only made me want to punch him in the face. I will note that in the last section in the book, Bouton shares about the impact the death of one of his daughters had on him, how he coped with it, and how it led to his invitation (finally) to a Yankees Old Timer’s Day. That section is a solid read, and if it the rest of the book had been like that, I would have rated this book 1-2 stars higher. But as it is, that section does not save the rest of this poorly-written diary.",5,N/A
762563,Ball Four,Brian Fagan,262,55,5,"March 11, 2022","Ball Four was a favorite book of my adolescent years. Written in 1970, it was a top selling memoir of Bouton's 1969 season with the Seattle Pilots (remember them? - I didn't) and the Houston Astros, to whom he was traded. The book exploded like a bomb, because Bouton named names and put so many in Major League Baseball - specific owners, GM's, managers, pitching coaches and players on the hot seat for their behavior. That year, Bouton took notes on his everyday life, and the book was assembled by him and Leonard Shechter and presented in diary form, which makes for easy reading. The inside scoop on a baseball player's life is wonderfully entertaining, 1000% more so than the routine sportswriter stuff the average fan reads about his team in the paper. But I do have mixed feelings about tell-alls. I can understand the outrage of those who feel they were betrayed by Bouton. How would you feel if your personal conversations with a co-worker suddenly went into a best-selling book ?The background is that Jim Bouton was a pretty successful pitcher who came up in the early 60's with the New York Yankees, and won two games for them in the 1964 World Series. Over time, he lost his best stuff and transitioned into a knuckleball pitcher. As we join him in 1969, he has been acquired by the first year expansion Seattle Pilots, and spends the season there and then in Houston trying to perfect the knuckleball. (I started the book on March 8th, and promptly read that that is his birthday.) In addition to the difficulty in throwing a good knuckleball, Bouton is frustrated by two daily issues. While the knuckleball is easy on the arm, it requires continuous practice and his coaches keep getting on him because they think he's throwing too much. And catchers are loathe to warm him up, because the ball floats all over the place, and has injured their throwing hands.As a teenager, I was enthralled to learn that grown-up men were as sex-crazed as I was. You'll learn all about the major league art of beaver-shooting. My brother and I both played baseball, he to the major league tryout level. We still tell stories from the book to this day. Other adolescent-level humor includes cup checks, chin music and the all-ugly squad. Bouton uses his platform to pepper in favorite stories from his old days with the Yankees, too.A lot of anger is directed toward THE SYSTEM, owners, GM's, managers and coaches. But of course Bouton has plenty of opinions about his teammates, too. He respects and gets along with most of them, a few are a__holes and a few are saints. The only thing that doesn't ring true to me is his assessment of major league pitching coaches as essentially useless. He quotes them using inane truisms, which I'm sure happens, but I struggle with his implication that, even for traditional pitcher teammates, they had very little help to offer with pitching mechanics.",5,N/A
762563,Ball Four,James Murphy,982,156,4,"October 6, 2019","A reread. I remember loving the book 100 years ago when I 1st read it. More discerning now, I was a little disappointed to think the prose a little ordinary. My fault, I know. I shouldn't expect a man who can throw a knuckleball to also be able to write like John Updike. But I found it less interesting, too. Mine is the expended edition, called The Complete Ball Four filling in Bouton's life since baseball. I found I wasn't interested at all in Balls 5, 6, and 7.I thought it not as sensational as my earlier, younger reading. These days I don't expect baseball players to be cleancut and morally sparkling--more like men at work, as George F. Will so insightfully saw them. So Bouton's celebrated revelations about bad behavior don't captivate or amuse a reader as they once did.Still, these are wonderful stories of the game and the people Bouton was associated with.",5,5
