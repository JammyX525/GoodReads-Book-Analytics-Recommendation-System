761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Stephen,"1,517",10800,4,"September 26, 2011","Horror...gore...twisted, nightmare imagery...let's get under the covers and read something scary... 
  
There are some truly blood-chilling moments in this excellent collection. Barker has a very unique voice and I thought all of these stories were at least good, with several being remarkable 5+ star worthy gems. Deeply evocative with shocking depictions that will glue themselves to your memory. This is a worthy collection for fans of the genre or anyone who enjoys quality, creative writing and isn't overly squeamish. Here are the stories:THE BOOK OF BLOOD: While a short story in and of itself, this really acts as the introduction to the series and ties the other stories together in a clever way. A good, solid story but worth reading more for its tie-in effect to the rest of the series (plus it is very short). 3.0 to 3.5 starsTHE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN: An excellent story that on the surface is suspenseful and well written, though a fairly standard horror story. However, below the surface is a superb and nuanced tale about the numbing horrors and oppresive pain experienced by normal people each and every day. Barker really layered this tale well and I thought it was excellent. 4.0 to 4.5 stars. THE YATTERING AND JACK: A comical story from Barker about a demon sent by Satan to drive a man insane. Worth reading but not one of my favorites. 3.0 starsPIG BLOOD BLUES: My FAVORITE story in the collection. A brilliant, brutal narrative about the ""kill or be killed"" nature of life. The imagery, the prose and the visceral, creeping horror are very unsettling. I will be thinking about the end of this one for a LONG, LONG time. A DEFINITE MUST READ!! 5.5 stars. SEX, DEATH AND STARSHINE:Good, solid story but not one of my favorites. Probably suffered by comparison to the previous story and the one that follows. 3.0 stars IN THE HILLS, THE CITIES: This was an amazingly imaginative story that left me WOWing and WTFing when the story device was finally revealed. Original and stunning and clear evidence of Barker's high level of creativity. I Don't want to give anything away, but this is simply brilliant and the imagery from this story will stick to your eyes long after you finish it. 5.0 to 5.5 stars. Overall, 4.0 to 4.5 stars and definitely the collection to try if you are looking to experience Barker's short fiction. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!  ",99,7

761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Laurie  (barksbooks),"1,695",656,4,"October 13, 2021","I originally read this book when when I was fourteen. I remember buying it with my allowance at the local drugstore. I'm betting most of it went over my head at the time but I have fond memories of scaring people away from speaking to me when reading this. I'm curious how I'll feel about it now that I'm no longer a tormented teen looking to hide from reality.The Book of BloodAfter recently seeing the movie adaptation of this short story, which was dreary, sexualized and not too bad even with some cliches thrown in, I was compelled to revisit this novel to see how the film matched up. Much was changed, of course. This ‚ÄúBook of Blood‚Äù is actually the introduction to all of the stories that follow it. The movie stands alone and is quite a bit different.The dead have highways and at one of these intersections sits the house at 65 Tollington Place. It looks like any other home but stay there too long and you‚Äôre sure to leave much different than when you arrived. A trio of paranormal investigators are successfully documenting the goings-on of the place but more is going on than meets the eye. The young medium that secretly lusts for fame and fortune and will do whatever must be done to acquire it is keeping secrets. Secrets that are enraging the dead. His beatific smile easily wins over Mary Florescu whose life‚Äôs work has been documenting paranormal events. She should know better but is overcome with desire and is blind until it‚Äôs too late and the dead have their way with him. Now he‚Äôs no longer beautiful and she must translate the stories the dead have written upon his skin. No one does dread and dank atmosphere like Clive Barker.The Midnight Meat Train Kaufman once adored the idea of New York until he lived there and saw the ugliness up close. Now New York is just another city and has lost its allure. A brutal string of murders in the subway system further sickens him in this city whose streets are awash with fresh blood. A man thinking himself a night-stalker and taking his job seriously preys the underground in search of a body whose flesh is worthy of his skill. Kaufman will discover he knew little of the true atrocities carried out in the city until he rides the subway one dark, lonely night . . . This story is gory, gritty and gives you something to think about.The Yattering and Jack This story was made into a super cheesy ""Tales from the Darkside"" episode. I watched it recently on the Chiller channel and am curious to see just how much they ruined the original story. This is a surprisingly ""lighter"" and slightly humorous story from Barker. The Yattering is a lower devil demon ousted from Hell to torment a human named Jack Polo. He doesn't know why and is thoroughly frustrated with his inability to drive the boring human into a raving lunatic. No matter how desperately the Yattering tries to upset Polo he remains unmoved. When Polo's daughters come for a visit the Yattering ratchets up his fright-fest. There's a funny scene involving the Yattering and his genitals that I didn't see in the televised version, hmmm. . . Needless to say, in the end, Polo isn't as dense as Yattering assumes. This version, of course, was much better than the cheesy Tales from the Darkside episode.Pig Blood Blues This one is dark and bloody and has the sexual undertones that color much of Barkers work. Redman, a former police officer, has been hired to teach wayward adolescents at a juvenile detention center. He quickly takes pity on a youth named Lacey who is continually the victim of bullying and offers him protection. As he gets to know the boy, he tells him a bizarre tale about the farm on the property involving suicide and a hungry pig. This one is strange and haunting. Sex, Death and StarshineBarker never pretties up his dead. Oh sure, they may have a facade of skin over their rotting corpses but you always know what they truly are the moment they enter the story and step out of the shadows. His dead are always putrefying, raw and terrifying but they‚Äôre quite often more classy than the living. I believe this is what has always drawn me to his work. This little story is about a theater's last production of Twelfth Night and the drama that ensues behind the scenes. While the temperamental theater folks are busy stabbing each other in the back over silly jealousy and pettiness some major drama is about to happen upon the scene in the form of a creepy stranger and his beautiful wife who wants the starring role. This wasn‚Äôt one of the best stories in the book but it highlights Barker‚Äôs love for his dead and his knack for embodying them with a dark grace. The humans come off as vulgar and petty and lacking in morals while the dead are much more refined even though they‚Äôre decaying corpses.In The Hills, The CitiesMick doesn‚Äôt discover that his lover is an obnoxious political bigot until he‚Äôs stuck with him on a trip to Yugoslavia and nearly bored to death by his tedious opinions. While Judd thinks Mick is an airhead who is content to keep his head in the clouds. It was supposed to be their honeymoon but apparently they should have spent some together before embarking on their trip. The only thing they have going for them is attraction.But in the hills hides the greatest wonder of the world. Within the hills its citizens are preparing an ancient ceremonial battle that pits city against city. Mick and Judd who are busy bickering and traversing these endless roads haplessly stumble upon something they were never meant to see. And of course they can‚Äôt look away when they should . . . This was a very original short story, unlike anything I've read before or since, but considering what happens Barker doesn't stay focused on the gore as he easily could have but more on the reactions of the two who witness this bizarre event.Funny, I remember this book as being shocking and horrifying and terribly gory but I didn't think it was any of those things the second time around. Guess I'm just too jaded now.",44,2

761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Niki,686,108,5,"October 30, 2017","Honestly? This short story collection is flawless.Every single story in this was without fault. All of them were haunting and really, really well written, and get a full 5 stars each from me. The weakest one was, in my opinion, ""Sex, Death and Starshine"", but that just means that it was slightly worse than the others, not that it was leagues beneath. My favourite was possibly ""The Yattering and Jack"" because it was clever as hell, but honestly, it's really hard to choose.I've already started the next volume.",28,7

761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Paul Nelson,608,137,4,"September 26, 2014","I listened to the audio version of Books of Blood volume 1 and while not being blown away by the majority of the narration, I thought four of the stories exceptional and the remaining two just didn‚Äôt do it for me but I guess you will always get that in most collections.Book of Blood 4*The first story follows a psychic researcher and a medium as they investigate a haunted house. This story was adapted to become part of the film the Book of Blood and visions of the highway of the dead. The medium doesn‚Äôt fare to well, you see frauds very often don‚Äôt and his final thought may well have been along the lines of wishing this particular door to the dead stayed well and truly shut. Nevertheless he ends up with the stories from the books of blood carved into his dead flesh becoming the literal source of the tales.The Midnight Meat Train 5*This one was my favourite, loved both the film and the short story and it‚Äôs interesting to see how the film was padded out to increase the screen time. The Midnight meat train is a vessel used to transport food to the age old masters under the city, the food is those humans who are unfortunate enough to pick this particular train and at the same time be deemed fit for consumption. Mahogany is the train‚Äôs butcher, with no regard for human life and a bag of tools you‚Äôll never want to see opened. The Midnight Meat Train on a subway to hell, a brutal harbinger of death and the one place on earth Kaufman shouldn‚Äôt have fallen asleep.The Yattering and Jack 4*A demon called the Yattering is sent by Beelzebub to haunt Jack, taunt him until his sanity breaks but it gets a little more than it bargained for. Its victim is frustratingly oblivious and seemingly unconcerned with the demons increasingly harsh course of harassment. The Yattering is luckily not too bright but can Jack turn the tide, or is it just a game with an assured victor. Demon or man?Pig Blood Blues 3*Couldn‚Äôt take to this story, I must subconsciously have something against pigs because when the sow in this story was described as being beautiful and alluring or words of that effect, I was lost never to recover.Sex, Death and Starshine 4.5*This tale starts of as an old fashioned theatre performance, the narrator put on a splendidly posh voice that was perfect for the setting and although probably not intended, I did laugh when he cursed and swore. Profanity in a posh voice just does it for me, don‚Äôt know why but I did laugh. On the whole though this turned into a chilling story of the dead come back to watch and star in the theatres last performance with a couple of disturbing sex scenes thrown in to add even more bite.In the Hills, the Cities 2.5*Mick and Judd, take a romantic but strained vacation in Yugoslavia and unwittingly find themselves in the middle of the strangest of wars. Couldn‚Äôt get into this story, thought it a bit strange at times and this was my least favourite.http://paulnelson.booklikes.com/post/...",23,1 comment
761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Stu Corner,167,22,4,"July 31, 2022","A diverse collection of classics from one of the masters of horror.I've read this series before -at some point a long time ago- So I decided to try the audiobooks, and wasn't disappointed. I've seen all the movies and tv adaptations made of the stories, but there's nothing like the books themselves. Josh Malerman's book 'Pearl' was a homage to one of the stories. Not every story is a winner, though. I wasn't a fan of Sex, Death, and Starshine - undeniably well-written, just not my style. Overall, a must read for any horror fan or budding horror author. 80's horror at it's finest.4.5 Stars",23,2
761023,Books of Blood Volume One,·¥• Irena ·¥•,"1,649",212,4,"October 18, 2014","3.5Books of Blood, Volume 1 is an entertaining six-story anthology. As usual, I didn't love every story. The last two didn't do much for me.	The Book of BloodThe dead have highways and a team of three people is at Tollington Place 65 to witness one of those turnpikes and intersections. 	The Midnight Train Kaufman's love for New York is not as strong as when he came to live there. Someone is butchering people in the subway and he is going to get in the middle of it and learn some of the city's history and its dark secrets along the way.	The Yattering JackMy favourite story. Hilarious. Yattering Jack is a lower level demon with a seemingly easy task to drive one man crazy. However, whatever he tries 'seemed to make no dent in his perfect indifference'.	Pig Blood BluesI hate pigs so that only added to the horror. Very disturbing story of a former police officer who got a job at a Centre for Adolescent Offenders only to realize that something is not quite right with the place. 	Sex, Death and ShineA story of one last production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. People are too busy being horrible, petty and mean to notice anything weird around them.	In the Hills, the CitiesA couple is on a trip in the Balkan hills. They are just realizing how incompatible they are and how little they have in common only to stumble upon a weirdest battle anyone has ever seen. ",21,10

Barker's creepy prose can be graphic at times yet provides its scares by creating a great sense of unease within the reader through wildly imaginative concepts that border on absurdity.

761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Ria,404,54,4,"November 24, 2021",got it mostly for the Midnight Meat Train story which turned out to be just ok but is one of my favorite movies. Books Of Blood was really good and i need to someday watch the movie...i feel like the translation was very mediocre and may be why i didn't enjoy it as much i thought it would... idk. i don't want to give it 3 stars so it's getting 4.,14,N/A
761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Erin *Proud Book Hoarder*,"2,376",1050,4,"April 4, 2017","Reflecting back after 14 years, Barker writes:""I look at these pieces and I don't think the man who wrote them is alive in me anymore.... We are all our own graveyards I believe; we squat amongst the tombs of the people we were. If we're healthy, every day is a celebration, a Day of the Dead, in which we give thanks for the lives that we lived; and if we are neurotic we brood and mourn and wish that the past was still present. Reading these stories over, I feel a little of both. Some of the simple energies that made these words flow through my pen--that made the phrases felicitous and the ideas sing--have gone. I lost their maker a long time ago."" It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve read these that reading them now is almost like experiencing them for the first time all over again. Having a shoddy memory mainly sucks, but in the case of book re-reads, it holds its gifts.I do remember some things though ‚Äì like when this came out, Barker was making his way on the horror scene big time, heavily endorsed by King himself, who said: ‚ÄúI have seen the future of horror, and his name is Clive Barker.‚Äù This quote was even used, with an actor voiceover, for the Hellraiser‚Äôs trailer years later. It is used, of course, on the Books of Blood as a selling point.Barker has since demonstrated extreme versatility in genre and form; you‚Äôre more than likely now of days to find his imaginative tombs lining the shelves in a fantasy section rather than a horror one. When he erupted onto the scene he did so with big bangs ‚Äì the Books of Blood series being one of the biggest.Immediately it‚Äôs clear Barker possesses a beautiful and poetic prose. If you asked me what stood out the most about this anthology, I‚Äôd answer that first: writing style. Altering rhythm to fit the story and not become repetitive, there‚Äôs emphasis where there should be, distance when that fits, all the while weaving both sides together naturally.The opening story, ‚ÄòThe Book of Blood,‚Äô is almost indecisive on where it wanted to go, but ultimately the end is a horrific, well-written arrival. Twisted, surreal, somewhat mystical, the tone for the rest of the anthology is accurately set. Basically the dead have highways by which they travel, and on one of these highways, at an interval, is a house. Inside that house is a poser boy pretending dangerously to be something he isn‚Äôt, joined by a paranormal investigator who goes in being duped but leaves exalted. And of course the dead are there. They‚Äôre ready to share their stories, how they ended up on this particular path, their personal damnations, so won‚Äôt you listen? 3.5/5In the Midnight Meat Train, Kaufman ends up traveling a dangerous path of his own. The man has loved, cherished, and longed for New York city from afar his entire life, but now that he‚Äôs finally planted his roots in the Big Apple, he finds only bitter tastes. Kaufman soon discovers a hidden aspect of the city; apparently one man‚Äôs horror is another man‚Äôs paradise. It‚Äôs grim, it‚Äôs brutal, there are gory details but nothing just for cheap shock value. Tension is severely taut in this one. I was chewing my lip and sitting wide eyed at a particular scene at the end. Dark and gritty finale - some disturbing stuff and interesting too. 4/5The Yattering and the Jack is whimsical and mildly amusing. The story shows the POV of a lower-level repulsive type of demon who is trying to ruin a man‚Äôs life and break him in the process. To his annoyance, this man seems to have no breaking point. There were amusing areas but I didn‚Äôt outright laugh. Que Sera, Sera‚Ä¶3/5‚ÄòPig Blood Blues‚Äô starts off reminding me of those redundant school type movies that glorified in teen rebellion in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. You know, the one where a decent person starts at a new school, wanting to teach and do well, but the kids are hellions and the governing figures don‚Äôt seem to give a damn. Then the other adults start getting a bit too out there with some of the kids, and flashes of the Wicker Man start burning in my head. Finally it just ends up leaving me with the memory of those nasty little pigs from that Hannibal scene in the movie. Quite disturbing. 3/5Sex, Death and Starshine is my personal favorite. It revives the old magic of the theatre, a love which apparently transcends death for the dearly departed. I give little thought toward theatre, but Barker is a fan in real life, and it shows through his words as he convincingly weaves his web on yours truly. I also ended up feeling the nostalgia, the magic. There‚Äôs some cheesiness I‚Äôd like to dust off from the second half, but the story shines the strongest because of a subtle, still eeriness that one can‚Äôt put into effective words. 4/5For the last offering, ‚ÄòIn the Hills, the Cities,‚Äô I liked the beginning banter between the two mains but became bored after. I dug the unique plot creation and the sociological, potent basis of it, but couldn‚Äôt hold focus in between that. 2/5Overall this anthology is the ideal length ‚Äì a groovy, gory intro story followed by five tales that offer disturbing doses of disturbed reality in completely different ways. This anthology deserves to be read and known, Barker did a great job creating unease and clearly has a poetic license to boot.",13,3
761023,Books of Blood Volume One,Anthony Vacca,423,277,5,"January 13, 2018","The first volume of Books of Blood is an excited debut that gushes with inventiveness the way the titular fluid leaves a severed artery. As gleefully moribund as they are perverse, each of the six stories collected here are elaborately conceived phantasmagorias that offer a reckoning for its protagonists who take the banality of existence for granted. For Barker, abandoned houses can be way stations on the highway of the dead; the subway can serve as a banquet cart for the underground rulers of the metropolis above their hoary heads; a thanksgiving dinner can be terrorized by a neurotic minor demon; a pig of behemoth proportions can rule a reform school like a mad queen; a failing theater house can experience a return to form thanks to an undead starlet; entire populations of cities can come together to form sky-high gods with nothing but ropes, straps and their willing bodies. Written with a sly sense of humor, Barker‚Äôs deranged tales delight now the same as they must have on first publication, when they gobsmacked readers like Stephen King and Ramsey Campbell.",13,2
