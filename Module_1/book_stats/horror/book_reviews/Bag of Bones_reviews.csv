10589,Bag of Bones,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,4,"August 9, 2020","A classic paranormal ghost story, showing how the creepiness of including kids in such settings can be lead to the marvelous extreme.It reminded me of Lisey´s Story, both proof of what not just great author, but loving husband King is. As he can´t get tired to repeat the importance of the support and help by his wife, that he writes to impress her, that we maybe won´t have seen all these unbelievable novels without the woman inspiring the master to give the best he can and of course the infamous Carrie in the trashbin tale. It´s better than Lisey´s story too, because it has more dynamic action, unexpected plot twists, and is one of King´s more underappreciated works, possibly because it´s less action and meta, but more about the exploration of the protagonist´s development, thoughts, and feelings, his mental state taking the place of the main protagonist, antagonist, and premise.These novels are completely different than the impersonal, just horror or fantasy works, King seems to use another approach towards creating these pieces than his usual mantra of letting the characters tell the story. His subconsciousness must do something to reduce the thrill and real, physical violence, to come closer to the Love(pun intended)craftian, subtle, psycho terror horror that is much more frightening than the expected, known types of horror one is used too. It´s far more tricky to read, for some readers definitively not as enjoyable, and therefore far less present in the horror genre that prefers to live up to Hollywood standards and stereotypes.Dark philosophizing about what might happen after the spouse, lover, lifelong partner over decades, or even a child, dies is something nobody wants to think about, but King goes the way, gives amazing introspections that haunt millions of real, poor people and expands the horror to having to deal with bursts of extreme violence and paranormal activity. That´s especially frightening if one is not sure if it´s just a reaction to the stress and sadness, serious mental illness or, worst and most difficult to detect and handle without one´s exorcist of trust, real manifestations of whatever other dimensions, parallel universes, or quantum foam may have prepared for meat sacks.Playing with the option of going bonkers, as King likes to do it with his different alter egos, is something possibly, quite counterintuitively, healthy for everyone, as it could show many of the blind spots and subjective errors one has accumulated over one´s life. At least better than needing real creepy nightmares to come to the realization. Reality and what lies behind it is one of the great topics and science will show who is right, but just thinking about the possible implications is truly no good evening hobby. Hardly one of King´s novels scared me so much (I was still young and not that internally dead as nowadays) and it led my fantasy to the logical question and the rational option of why not going to visit some haunted places. I still didn´t do it, not sure if I should, it´s ridiculous because I am doing as if I am that hyper rational, but visiting or living in such places might get even too tricky for me. I mean, honestly, who buys a freaking, old, cursed spooky castle to live in? Possibly with the bedroom in the former torture chamber, no thanks.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...",263,11

With a slow start that focused on a thought provoking custody battle; this is still all-in-all a ghost story, so not really my cup of tea, as ghosts don't really do it for me.

10589,Bag of Bones,Char ,"1,595",1441,4,"November 21, 2015","Grief. That's the emotion that got to me the most during this reread.The first time I read this book I had just turned thirty and even though I was already married, the horror of losing a spouse didn't get through to me like it did this time. Now, after just having celebrated my 30th wedding anniversary, the idea of losing my husband is unfathomable. Stephen King dove deep into those fathoms and dragged me along with him. I did not like what I saw or felt. That, right there, is the reason why Stephen is the KING.I'm not going to go into the plot too much here, this is an old book and it's even had a made-for-TV-movie, so I can't say much most people don't already know. This story is a combination of ghost story, revenge, and love story. It has genuinely scary moments and other moments so poignant that I found myself with tears in my eyes. But what is most important about this tale, about all of King's works, really, are the characters. King creates characters that are so real you feel like you can reach out and touch them. They are so real, you take in their emotions as your own. And he does it by not shying away from the ugly moments we all experience inside our own heads.  The fact that widower Mike Noonan lusts after a young woman is painful for Mike to acknowledge and we, the Constant Readers, can  feel  how Mike is torn between that lust and guilt, and all the tangled feelings of betrayal and loss that go along with that. Even though he's widowed, he feels these emotions and we can feel  them too. In our hearts, we know what Mike is feeling is true, because that's how WE would feel. Not only does King draw great good characters, he draws great bad ones, as well. His bad guys, not just Mr. Devore from this book, but ALL of them, have layers and a realness to them that brings them alive. They're not just men dressed in black, (Randall Flagg, I'm looking at you), they're complicated, (Trashcan Man), they have depth to them, and we (I?) LOVE to hate them. In this book, Mr. Devore is a rich, frail, elderly man in a wheelchair, yet he still comes at Mike with a menace that is horrible to witness. Our emotions are pulled every which way, how could we HATE an old man in a wheelchair? But there is no question that we DO hate him, and there again, the King has manipulated our emotions and has his Constant Readers, and all other readers, in the palms of his skilled, talented hands.I loved this book. I love Stephen King. That doesn't mean that I've loved every book he's written, but I usually do love his characters and creations, (Wolf, Billy Bumblers), and they still live within my memory. For me, no other author has created so many memorable characters and place settings. The words Derry, Jerusalem's Lot and Pennywise- they all cause an instant picture to appear in my brain. I say let him plant a picture in your brain too: of Sarah Laughs, of the T.R. and Mr. Devoe, Mattie and Kyra. I'm pretty sure you'll thank me later. I highly recommend this book to everyone. Just hold on tight, because your emotions are going to get knocked around a bit by the King, but hey, there's no one better qualified to do so. You'll be getting knocked around by one of the best authors living today. I was asked way back in January, I think, to participate in the King For A Year project, and I was honored to be asked. This review is for that project, which I have thoroughly enjoyed reading.

  “Grief is like a drunken houseguest, always coming back for one more goodbye hug.”
This is a story of grief and loss and marriage and hauntings - both by ghosts and memories - told in Stephen King’s trademark sprawling narration that has dark secrets that haunt small towns, the thin lines between reality and supernatural that can so easily snap, and regular people caught in the jaws of a world that has teeth and is not afraid to bite. But more than anything this is a story of a man missing his dead wife and a writer struggling with the loss of his ability to create stories. And King is excellent at that - human emotions and human nature and the pain of loneliness.
  “I cried because I suddenly realized that I had been walking a white line ever since Jo died, walking straight down the middle of the road. By some miracle, I had been carried out of harm’s way. I had no idea who had done the carrying, but that was all right—it was a question that could wait for another day.”
 
  
Bag of Bones is a story of marriage and the immense grief at losing a partner. These motifs are common in King’s books — the special intimate world of a long-term partnership, the secret language and rituals of a marriage not ever fully understandable to outsiders. The overwhelming numbing pain Mike feels, with all the anger and despair and loneliness, rings so true and is so profoundly moving. The love and understanding between partners, in this case literally transcending death, is fascinating. King writes about this with such feeling that it stops me in my tracks, makes me catch my breath and nod in recognition and terror about eventually having to go through something like that. Because King knows and *gets* people and love and the invisible strands that tie us together, and understands how fragile happiness can be shattered. 
  “[…] Any good marriage is secret territory, a necessary white space on society’s map. What others don’t know about it is what makes it yours.”
Yet again King exceeds all expectations creating a small New England town - this time a place that is not even a town but an unincorporated township known as the TR. A tight-knit closed-lipped insular community where stubborn pride and sincere generosity, seeming good-naturedness and almost claustrophobic distrust of strangers are all intertwined. A seemingly folksy place full of skeletons - or rather bags of bones - hidden in metaphorical closets, buried under lake waters, closely guarded. The world where “summer people” will never fully fit in. The place that can shield one of its own behind a shoulder-to-shoulder wall — but you are not going to enjoy being on the other side of that wall.
  “There is such a thing as town consciousness—anyone who doubts it has never been to a New England town meeting. Where there’s a consciousness, is there not likely to be a subconscious?”
Another thing that King does very well is showing us the existential fear of writers — the desperation and frustration that comes with losing your ability to write and you are helpless to make it stop. King is at his best when he writes about his craft, and I can’t help but think that he allows us to peek behind that curtain in his brain just for the briefest moment.
  “That is in some ways the strangest part of the creative process. The muses are ghosts, and sometimes they come uninvited.”
 
  
And beneath it all - the love, the loss, the community ties - are strands of visceral anger and revenge. This is one of those few books where you feel the pain of both sides because the true dangers don’t usually come from the world beneath our reality but from our fellow humans, and revenge and justice do not always go hand in hand. Two wrongs never make a right, and it’s painful and sad and poignant.
  “I suspect that fright, like pain, is one of those things that slip our minds once they have passed. What I do remember is a feeling I’d had before when I was down here, especially when I was walking this road by myself. It was a sense that reality was thin. I think it is thin, you know, thin as lake ice after a thaw, and we fill our lives with noise and light and motion to hide that thinness from ourselves.”
Like most “later” King books, this one is almost leisurely slow, going along at a walking pace, taking breaks often enough for us to get to know the characters in vivid brush strokes — and yet it does not quite feel drawn-out or bloated. When King takes his time to explore the characters and the plot slows down to a halt, I still don’t mind because the strengths of his characterizations and observations are a pleasure to read. And his language is particularly strong here; King stated before that he emphasizes the story over the literary form, but this one slants literary nevertheless — all while keeping his ear for dialogue and his razor-sharp observations and damn good storytelling.
  “I think houses live their own lives along a time-stream that’s different from the ones upon which their owners float, one that’s slower. In a house, especially an old one, the past is closer.”————“The last of these dreams was a nightmare, but until that one they had a kind of surreal simplicity. They were dreams I’d awake from wanting to turn on the bedroom light so I could reconfirm my place in reality before going back to sleep. You know how the air feels before a thunderstorm, how everything gets still and colors seem to stand out with the brilliance of things seen during a high fever?”
Honestly, don’t come to this book expecting horror in a traditional sense, there’s none of that to be found. Yes, there’s plenty of creepiness and unsettling moments — but it’s something else altogether, something more contemplative and observant and haunting and often unexpectedly brutal. It’s simply a “King”, its own genre by now. It’s not about the typical scares. The true dread comes from unexpected places — like that bizarre and almost surreal rock-throwing scene, for instance, where seemingly mundane becomes truly creepy.
   “At night your thoughts have an unpleasant way of slipping their collars and running free.”
It’s not perfect by any means. There’s a bit too much relentless precociousness in the kid character, and a bit over-the-top villain, and the denouement is a tad too long. And yet those faults are minor, and what stayed with me ever since I first read it at 16 and what is still there now is the haunting gut-wrenching atmosphere and the weight of learning to survive your grief and loss. And yes, it did hit me much harder now than back when I was a teen, yet to have things to lose.

The audio version is narrated by King himself, all 22 hours of it (which is how I ended up spending a whole month with it), and it’s pretty damn special hearing the story in the author’s voice. Plus it has a 30 min interview with King in the end, and that was quite interesting.4 stars.",96,10
10589,Bag of Bones,Johann (jobis89),614,4239,4,"September 25, 2018","""Grief is like a drunken house guest, always coming back for one more goodbye hug.""Bag of Bones focuses on the story of Mike Noonan, a best-selling writer who's wife unexpectedly passes away. Following her death, Mike suffers from writer's block and begins to have nightmares concerning their lakeside house, Sara Laughs. Mike decides he must go back to their lakeside house in order to confront his fears. Upon his arrival, he meets a beautiful single mother and her daughter, only to find out that a crazy millionaire wants to obtain custody of the young girl, who is his granddaughter. Mike decides he must help the young mother and daughter, but other sinister forces are also at work...I truly believe that no one can depict grief like King can. Between this and Lisey's Story, King seems to have a unique talent for describing those feelings of loss and the process of grief itself. And that is part of the reason why I love King so much, it just feels like he gets you and he is able to connect with his reader so easily. Bag of Bones opens with Mike Noonan trying to cope following the unexpected death of his wife Johanna to a brain aneurysm, and these opening scenes are just heartbreaking to read. Mike's grief is so prominent and it's very easy to empathise with this character. The reality of Johanna's death really hits Mike when he realises that she will never move past page 103 in her current read (this really struck a cord with me). Shortly after her death, the nightmares surrounding their lakeside house begins...This book did actually unsettle me at times. There's just something about creepy happenings occurring in your house. It's those kind of storylines that freak me out the most - the ones that quite literally hit close to home. It's kinda why movies like Paranormal Activity are so effective. Some of the scenes King described left me with the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. Serves me right for reading alone in bed late at night...The characters themselves are pretty special. Mike Noonan is just a damn good man. He is caring, generous, thoughtful, and that somehow makes it more difficult to watch him suffering through the loss of his wife. Although Johanna is strictly not a ""live"" character, she is very much present in this novel, and again, she is a genuinely good person. So her death is even more tragic. Upon meeting Mattie after his arrival at the lakehouse, you find yourself willing Mike to move on, almost like you want to tell him that it's okay. Often when I encounter this kind of a scenario in a book, I am like ""HOW DARE YOU! She's barely cold in her grave!"" but you can feel Mike's pain and he is clearly a good man who deserves some happiness in his life.How many times do I need to emphasise that King is literally the BEST at developing characters and their relationships. People who say King is all about horror and scares, need to read books like these in order to truly understand what King is really all about. Yes, this book could be considered ""horror"" in a way, but it's not your usual haunted house storyline at all. It's so much more than that. As for the ""baddies"" in this book - they were horrible, vile characters, particularly the character Max Devore.The twists and turns and unfolding of events in this novel was very impressive. I was constantly wondering what was coming next, how everything was linked, and I'm very happy to say that it all paid off. One minor complaint is regarding some of the scenes towards the end that made me feel slightly uncomfortable. I felt like perhaps it was maybe a bit too much...however it did really have an impact on me, and perhaps that was King's intention? So maybe it did work then?Anyway, all in all, a great book. 5 stars out of 5 for me! I'm on a run of great King books!Update: listened to audiobook in September 2018. Still a really great book but more boring parts than I remembered.... and that scene at the end was a tad too brutal for me. Just very uncomfortable.",94,7

  Initial Thoughts 
Its been a long time since I've read a Stephen King book. I think the last one was Billy Summers when that was released. A fine book and something different, but not quite up there with his horror classics. You know what I'm talking about. The likes of Pet Semetary, Salem's Lot and The Stand. But going so long without dipping in to King has left me thirsty. The man is perhaps the greatest storyteller in modern literature. Sometimes you do forget exactly how good he is and why he's so many people's favourite author. Well it's time for me to get reacquainted with him with a book I've never read before. Which is crazy as it's a Bram Stoker, Locus and World British Fantasy award winner for best novel. But I've heard a lot of bad reports on this one being slow and overwritten. Well time to find out for myself, which is always the best way in life.I know Fairy Tale was released last month. But I was in the mood for horror in the build up to Halloween. No fantasy in the Edmunds household. So without further ado, let's dig out that beast of a book...Bag of Bones.
  The Story 
Yes this is a horror story and we kick off in Derry, Maine (home of It and Insomnia), where popular author Michael Noonan suffers the awful tragedy of loosing his wife, Jo, to a brain aneurysm. Struggling with grief and coming to terms with the loss, he is plagued by writer's block and his life appears to be stuck in limbo.Racked by surreal and disturbing dreams he eventually submits to the notion that he must return to their summer home of 'Sara Laughs' in the backwoods of TR-90 that is right next door to everyone's favourite town of Castle Rock. Once there events only continue to get spookier and what at first appears to be the perfect place for Michael to grieve turns out to be the home of a dark secret. And he can't shake that feeling that he isn't alone. You weren't expecting things to go smoothly though we're you? this is a Stephen King book after all.But as with all of his books there is a lot more than just horror and there is two storylines at work. Shortly after arriving Michael stumbles into the lives of Mattie Devore, a recently widowed mother, and her three year old daughter Kyra. He soon finds himself the only person in the small community that is willing to support the pair against mad billionaire grandfather, Max Devore, who is dead set on getting custody of young Kyra. It really is win at all costs for both parties and Michael finds himself firmly in the middle.
  The Writing 
There's a good reason why this book has won numerous awards, it's very well written. There's a few out there that believe King's writing has matured gradually over his career as he has started to shift away from horror more and more. Although I wouldn't call it literary fiction Bag of Bones could certainly be called a more literary approach when compared to his early works. If you completely removed the horror element you'd still have a compelling piece of fiction that explores a number of themes.One of those key themes in Bag of Bones is grief and how it severely impacts us. As we know from books like Pet Semetary, King is an absolute master of “real-life horror” and writes this even better than the supernatural stuff.I've heard a number of folk criticise this book for being slow. But it is a slow burn and one hundred percent meant to be that way. Its as much a mystery as it is a horror and King takes a subtle approach to building this one. I can definitely see why it might turn a few off, admittedly the tension did drop at points. But it certainly gives you time to ponder and think about what's going down rather than having things spelled out to you in rapid succession. It's very similar to Peter Straub's amazing Ghost Story in the way it takes its time in the first half and then really ramps it up in the last quarter.There's a lot to enjoy here with the way King depicts a small, insular community with its own unique atmosphere and dynamics. We've seen him do it time and again. An absolute master at work.His vivid descriptions of Maine are a treat and I loved how he incorporated the changing weather to impact on the tone of the narrative. Plus the actual scenes of horror had me gripping the pages with white knuckles, unable to put the book down. Even when my daughter is repeatedly punching me in the arm demanding her dinner. Or supper, depends how long I've been in the reading zone for. Disclaimer: no children were harmed in the production of this review.
  ""What comes in when daylight leaves is a kind of certainty: that beneath the skin there is a secret, some mystery both black and bright. You feel this mystery in every breath, you see it in every shadow, you expect to plunge into it at every turn of a step. It is here; you slip across it on a kind of breathless curve like a skater turning for home. "" 

  The Characters 
This is one of the few books that Stephen King chose to write in first-person with the main character of Mike Noonan driving things. He certainly makes for an entertaining guide and was a pretty likeable character, despite coming across a bit snobby at times.Again it was another author and you couldn't help but feel this was a reflection of King himself. He certainly feels very real and alive, ready to step off the page, which is a hallmark of King's characters. His reflections on the writing process were fascinating and very intimate. A highlight of the novel for sure along with the portrayal of his paralysing grief. Now and again his brooding did slow the pace of the novel down to a grinding halt however.Despite this not being the best set of characters from the Kingmeister, they were all realistic and we'll fleshed out. Kyra was certainly my favourite and reminded me a bit of my own daughter when she was that age. Too clever for her own good! She really did give Mike's character purpose and their relationship was heartwarming.King did such an amazing job with the location you could argue that was a character in itself. He painstakingly adds detail and backstory creating a real history and shared psychology that helps make the story such an immersive experience.Also, there's a number of Easter eggs that the author throws for his Constant Readers that include some returning characters from previous stories. I won't say who they are but keep your eyes peeled.
  Final Thoughts
Overall Bag of Bones is an excellent book. Although it's not amongst his very best, it does showcases King's strengths as an author and is certainly not amongst his worst. It would be in my consideration for his top twenty, let's put it that way.I thought the ending in this one definitely jumped it up a few marks. The two separate storylines intersect fantastically. King gets criticised for not being able to end a novel but this one was terrific. The final revelation is truly horrific, amongst the most shocking scenes he's written, and the overall atmosphere in those final pages is awesome.Ok, I'll admit it is a little long-winded but this is a book worth reading, and I would definitely recommend it to those who love a good slow burn ghost story.Thanks for reading...cheers!

10589,Bag of Bones,Erin (PT),559,92,3,"November 8, 2011","Here's the thing about me and Stephen King: no matter how problematic and/or angry-making I find some of his work to be, the man knows how to tell a good story. I had read Bag of Bones before, when it was first published, but all I really remembered about it was that I found it an enjoyable enough story, but not one that was excellent enough to be particularly memorable. And, indeed, I found myself remembering very little of the story while rereading it this time around. Which, on the one hand, the kind of thing I hope for with a reread so that it, again (and hopefully) has the power to surprise me again. There are good things about Bag of Bones. It is a real page-turner of a ghost story, one that gathers momentum page by page to a huge and appropriately dramatic climax. This is important because the quality of King's endings does vary greatly from novel to novel. The narrative arc of Bag of Bones is a very smooth and appropriate one, where 'appropriate' references the gradual raising of the story's stakes from beginning to end. As well, this is one of King's many stories with a writer as a protagonist and few other writers I've read can express the exalted joys, the abysmal lows and strange, superstition filled territories of that state. But there are bad things, too. From my original reading, I did remember that the ghostly part of the story somehow revolved around a black woman (Sara Tidwell) who was murdered and whose child was murdered and the whole thing later hushed up by the largely white town. It was, in fact, the one thing I did remember about the story and I remember not feeling completely sanguine or satisfied about it during my initial reading, though I didn't have a strong recollection of why.Reading it this time, I think part of the problem is that I didn't have the knowledge or the vocabulary to put to the why, just that vague sense of I don't like this. I'm not sure I have the knowledge now to fully flesh out that feeling, but even on a second read, it's definitely still there. My initial and most immediate reaction was to the race issues involved here. King frequently writes about small town Maine and the small-town (white) folks that live there with a lot of small town (white) attitudes. He also writes a lot about Magical Negroes. A friend and I were just talking about this (in reference to a different King book) and I said to her, ""It's just the price of admission with King."" And…though I'm not thrilled about that, it's still just true. So the fact that the underpinnings of this story is about egregious and heinous crimes that were carried out against a tiny black community by the denizens of this unincorporated township—through the direct action of a small few, and the cover up and subsequent shunning and/or harassment and/or passivity of all the rest—all written by a middle-aged, relatively small-town white dude is already enough to get my hackles up. In the course of the story, Sara Tidwell is repeatedly gang raped, forced to watch as her only child is drowned, then is strangled herself (while still being raped). Her remains and those of her murdered son are moved around, buried, unburied and then reburied, not even allowed to rest. Though everyone knows who is responsible for her and her son's disappearance (and presumed death), no justice is served and, when the Tidwell family won't lie down and accept this state of affairs, the township turns against them, to the point that someone leaves an animal trap in the woods which eventually kills another of the Tidwell children. The Tidwells and the other members of their small community, under this duress, leave the township. And while, on the one hand, I don't think that King, in text or without, condones what happens to Sara Tidwell, her son or the rest of the Tidwells, at the same time, the story is set up so that Sara's revenant and vengeful spirit is the ultimate villain of the piece, a monster that has to be vanquished by the (white) (male) (middle-aged) hero of the piece, largely to save the life of a beautiful, blue-eyed, blonde haired little girl. That…doesn't really sit well. It's a very gristly lump to digest, imo. But, thinking about it longer and further, I feel like my issues are actually bigger and deeper than that. Upon more thought, the closest comparison I could come was, ironically enough, a story written by one of King's sons, Joe Hill. In my review of Hill's Heart Shaped Box, I wrote: ""Though I feel that the story is really theirs, both women are presented as secondary characters and, more importantly, victims."" I feel as though the same problem of point of view and who, exactly 'owns' this story presents itself in Bag of Bones. Sara Tidwell is inarguably a victim here. Mattie Devore, love interest of the protagonist, Mike Noonan, and girl in a fridge, is unquestionably victimized in the course of the story, first by Max Devore, who attempts to literally buy her daughter, then attempts to use the law to steal her daughter and finally, tries to kill her daughter. Devore uses his money and influence to get the town to turn against Mattie, to get her fired from her job and, eventually, he pays to have her killed. As a result, Mattie's daughter, Kyra, loses her only remaining parent; though only three years old, she is equally victimized by Devore. Reaching a little further, you could argue that the town mothers (including Noonan's wife, Jo) are victimized by the men who raped and murdered Sara Tidwell and murdered her son; Sara's revenge against them spans generations, culling the family lines of those men who wronged her—and robbing those women whose worst sin was marrying into those families of their children. In Jo Noonan's case, there's an open question of whether Sara's interference even deprived her of her life. So there's a lot in the fabric of the story that could be said—about patriarchy, about misogyny, about abuses of power, and about race. And, to be fair, I do think that King attempt to address some of these things. But I don't think King's own collection of privileges puts him in the right place to truly or adequately address them and the fact that he lenses the entire story through the viewpoint of an avatar much like himself—a wealthy, white, middle-class man—means that the horrible abuses against all these women are second fiddle to that avatar's man pain and his quest to extricate himself from those same sins of the father (or great-grand-uncle, as it were). So, though Mike is a likeable enough character, his happy ending isn't as satisfying as it might otherwise be, coming, as it does, at the expense of all these wronged, victimized and otherwise unavenged women. Sara Tidwell is a supernatural monster whose bones (and those of her son) are destroyed by lye, denied both her revenge and a respectful or peaceful burial. The last scions of the families that did this to her escape. Mattie Devore has the momentary triumph of knowing her custody of Kyra is secured, but she dies frightened and in pain, half her face blown away simply because of a dead rich man's sour grapes; Devore has already killed himself is out of the picture before the hit against Mattie is even enacted. Kyra is orphaned and traumatized by both the living and the dead. Though no specific number is called out, at least four other mothers lost children to the terrible revenge set in motion when Sara Tidwell was murdered as she was. So putting a smiling face on the relatively happy life that Mike will go on to live over these piles of bones is both a little macabre and an almost brilliant (if unintentional) illustration of why all these things still happen and still matter. At the end of it all, Bag of Bones isn't a bad story so much as one that fails to grasp what it reaches for and that feeds into the same –isms it tries to discuss and depict. It could be better. I wish it were better. But it is just more bones than flesh.",69,6
10589,Bag of Bones,Elyse Walters,"3,846",34900,4,"November 18, 2022","Audiobook….read by Stephen King …..21 hours and 21 minutesWriting block was the least of Mike Noonan’s problems — for our middle-aged ‘best selling’ fiction author/protagonist. He was suffering with grief, sadness, loneliness, and depression—he was a total walking zombie from despair over the death of his wife, Jo, who died, four years ago. He learned she was pregnant after her death… and couldn’t for the life of him understand why she hadn’t told him. After those first four years of Mike’s unproductive writing, emotionally depleted, apathetic, mentally exhausted state …..he took his grief, depression, and loneliness to his second home in Maine where he and Jo often vacationed. Something was drawing him back to the house. Mike hoped being back in their home — called Sarah Laughs — it would rekindle a spark of enthusiasm and imagination ….. so that plays creative juices would start flowing and he’d start writing (productively). While back in his vacation, Lakehouse, Mike begins to have frightening dreams with ghosts on the property. He meets a young widow named Mattie, a single mother to her toddler-daughter, Kyra.Mike is enchanted enough to want to help Mattie financially—as she is facing some ugly legal problems with her wealthy father-in-law, who wants soul custody of Kyra. Lots of mystery-suspense surprises-mixed with nostalgia, a sincere warmth of generosity and heart. I enjoyed this book.It held my interest weaving a few spooky parts with a sweet love story. It’s not heavy horror ….(not completely absent though, either) The heartfelt inner turmoil that Mike Noonan was dealing with throughout was very real— easy to empathize. The setting was great — as were the locals. The good guys were good and the bad bad. I enjoyed listening to Stephen King read his own novel. He owned it! And he delivered it like a pro! ",59,9
10589,Bag of Bones,Jeff ,912,674,4,"October 3, 2018","When people talk about the great Stephen King books, Bag of Bones is almost never part of the conversation. When I agreed to do a buddy read it was because of its connection to Moon and the Sixpence and the recommendation of my favorite and greatest of all Mah Fahs, Stepheny. Consequently, I didn’t go into this buddy read with the Purveyors of the Pantsless Reads with any grand expectations. I can honestly say I was happily disappointed.The skinny: Mike Noonan, a writer, tragically loses his wife at a young age and subsequently develops writers block. He moves into the couple’s summer house in order to shake up the craft and deal with some nagging dreams he’s been having. He finds a connection with a 20-year old widow and her 3-year old daughter. Problem is there’s a custody battle brewing for the child involving the kid’s grandfather, who’s a crazy, stone-throwing evil old coot.Plus, the summer house is haunted – brimming to the rafters with ghosts.What works here are the characterizations and the palpable love story between Mike and his long dead wife, it rises off the page and grabs you on a visceral level. The story itself works well up until crunch time, then King gets overwhelmed by some semi-important plot devices that lose focus and get muddled as the pages turn. King once again provides a classic example of the difficulty he has in dealing with a protagonist.  The Outsider? Where the hell did that come from? Still, this is 6/7th of a good read and recommended for anyone who digs ghost stories or adorable precocious psychic toddlers or love stories that involve ghosts and adorable precocious psychic toddlers.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",54,19
10589,Bag of Bones,Carol,"1,370",2120,4,"April 26, 2016","Some ghosts can be deadly............and as KING fans already know, evil always seems to be present in and around Derry.BAG OF BONES is the story of novelist Michael Noonan and the effects of his profound grief after the sudden loss of his beloved wife. Even after four years, a paralyzing writer's block takes over his days and creepy repetitive dreams fill his nights that ultimately lead him back to his log cabin hideout, Sara Laughs, in the woods of western Maine.Not long after his arrival, a combination of two pretty new friends and haunting voices of devilry feed Mike's imagination that unwind a nightmarish and dangerous mystery to solve with powerful adversaries from not only this world, but the world beyond.Great ghostly story of horror and romance that is a bit slow getting started, but packs more than one devastating punch!",50,5
10589,Bag of Bones,Lyn,"1,845",16300,3,"January 5, 2018","“The muses are ghosts, and sometimes they come uninvited.” A very good ghost story.Stephen King’s 1999 novel about a lonely hamlet in western Maine is told with King’s rare gift for telling these kinds of stories. More than just a ghost story, the author fills his pastoral, suspenseful tale with generations of bad times coming down into a point on a lake, and a town that has some bad history and some secrets.“I think reality is thin, you know, thin as lake ice after a thaw, and we fill our lives with noise and light and motion to hide that thinness from ourselves.”King’s protagonist is a writer of romantic suspense novels with more than just a passing success. As King tells it, he is on the best seller lists that go to 15. Enough success that he and his wife have a summer house on a lake near the New Hampshire border. When a tragedy tears his life apart, Mike Noonan travels to the isolated cabin to try and get his head on straight.And, of course, that’s where King’s expertise takes over. Drawing inspiration from earlier novels The Shining and Pet Sematary, King draws Noonan into a web of old mysteries tied to present day conflict.Well-crafted and told by a master, this was a page turning and entertaining book. Recommended.",48,3
10589,Bag of Bones,Kerri,949,342,5,"November 29, 2020","Whenever I'm not sure what I feel like reading next, I go for a Stephen King book. I seem to like all of his books, including the ones others hate intensely or find boring! I've had a copy of this one for a while - I was quite thrilled to find a hardcover edition in a charity shop some months ago. I'm not sure how much it was, I got a stack of books for $3, and this was the one I was most excited about. Stephen King excels at writing about grief, and this was no exception. Mike Noonan's wife dies suddenly. He's a grief-stricken, middle-aged writer who can no longer write. The writers block that is more than writers block. And then there's his lakeside retreat, Sara Laughs -- he's dreaming about it, finds himself drawn back there, and is soon caught up in the lives of young widow Mattie Devore and her three-year-old daughter Kyra. This references the book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier frequently, a book I haven't read yet, but intend to soon. I'm sure once I have read it there will be many nods to that story that I will appreciate.  Even without being familiar with it, I loved this book. Mike Noonan is a character that you can't help but feel compassion for. He's grieving for his wife, grieving for his inability to write and tries his best to help Mattie out when he realises she is facing an unfair custody battle that she is likely to lose as she has no financial resources to fight with. Her father-in-law basically intends to buy her child, one way or another, and Mike is unwilling to sit by and let it happen. Especially since the ghosts in his house tell him to save her.I think this is a ghost story, and it's a chilling one at times, but perhaps the scariest part is the all too real horror of unkind people who can often do what they want because they have a lot of money. Mike has less money, but enough that maybe he can help. He quickly became a favourite Stephen King character for me - I could have happily read hundreds of additional pages about him!I liked the ending. It was quite brutal, especially when we finally find out what happened to Sara Laughs and her son. And Mattie's death! It wasn't unexpected, but the way it happened was. Like Mike, I was too focused on the house and the ghosts, not the living people with guns. Of course I had wanted them to live happily ever after or something along those lines, both offered a second chance at love after being widowed so young, but I also knew that was unlikely as this didn't feel like that kind of book.",45,4
10589,Bag of Bones,Mohammad Ali Abedi,433,32,1,"January 21, 2016","Reading this book is the first novel you have the absolute proof where you can confidently say, “Stephen King is now a typical middle aged author”. Because he uses the plot device they all use. Love between older man and young woman. And every aspect of it is such a silly middle aged fantasy that is almost pathetic to read. The character in the book is a stand-in for King at that moment in his life. He is above 40, rich for writing popular novels, which so far is nothing new for King’s characters, but here he also has a wife which seems to be like his real life wife, but in this book, she dies. Not divorced, the character doesn’t have an affair, just his perfect wife from his perfect marriage dying, so that King through his character can comfortably engage in his fantasy without feelings of guilt or complicating it.And the object of attraction isn’t just a younger woman, it’s a very young woman who if I remember correctly was 20 or 21, but when the book introduces her she apparently looks even younger, as young as a teenager, but middle aged man can’t comfortably fantasize about fucking 16 years old, but it is perfectly harmless for them to want to fuck a 20 year old who looks 16.Notice how nicely the fantasy is being laid. Married man doesn’t have be guilty about his feelings, because he loved his wife and she is now dead and probably would want him to continue living life. The girl is young, looks young, but isn’t illegally young. And from here, the rest should be obvious . The girl is in trouble and has a small child, so the man isn’t just going after a horny college student, no, the man is helping a poor single mom, whose husband has also died young (and who we learn is the only person the girl has had sex with, so as virgin as they come without being a virgin). And most of all, the man is an absolute gentleman when it comes to the girl. He keeps his distance, respects her, helps her, is absolutely wonderful with her little girl, and the young woman has to BEG him to fuck her. I’ve not talked much about the actual story, because it’s not really important. All we need to know is that this is a purely King fantasy, and I almost felt awkward reading it, because I felt like it should have remained in King’s head when he lies at night and looks at his wife snoring and starts to wonder…",41,3
