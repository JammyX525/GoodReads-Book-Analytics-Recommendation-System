10607,Black House,Johann (jobis89),614,4239,5,"February 7, 2020","""What you love, you must love all the harder because someday it will be gone.""Twenty years ago, a young boy named Jack Sawyer travelled to a parallel universe called The Territories to save his mother's life. Now a retired homicide detective, Jack has no memory of these adventures. There is a sick serial killer on the loose, murdering and eating children, and the local chief of police begs Jack to help his force catch him.I love Stephen King. I love serial killers. Combine the two and you have a book that is right up jobis89's street. The Talisman is an epic fantasy tale, spanning across our world and The Territories, as Jack Sawyer embarks on a mission to travel across the country to try and save his mother (and her Twinner) from death. Black House, however, is darker, much more of a horror novel, I feel, and it focuses on one small town - Coulee County. The Talisman is a great, great book, but Black House is just more to my slightly darker, slightly more murderous, cannibalistic tastes… sorrynotsorry *evil laugh*There's so much to love about Black House. Other reviews I had looked at had pointed out the narrative style as something they did not like about Black House - well, I LOVED the narrative style. It's a bit slow and hard to get into at the beginning, but once I did I really enjoyed it. The narrative style is as if you're flying over Coulee County and you're allowed little snapshots into the lives of the residents through a bird's-eye perspective.Yet more awesome characters… we had Wolf in The Talisman, and now we have Henry Leyden in Black House - a blind guy who has a keen ear for voices and sounds. I loved Henry so much!! And the bikers were cool additions too. I generally really liked a lot of the characters in this one. The villain in particular - The Fisherman - was fucking terrifying. King's villains can sometimes be pretty ""grey"", they aren't always definitively evil. However, in this case, he is evil incarnate, which is no surprise given his similarities to the vile Albert Fish (I could say more but don't want to give away potential spoilers). I had complaints while reading The Talisman that it felt like the Dark Tower without actually being the Dark Tower - almost like a cheap imitation I guess. And finally in Black House my suspicions are answered as connections to the Dark Tower are made. Meanwhile I'm fangirling and getting all emotional over mentions of Roland Deschain and the rest of our beloved ka-tet. Link a book to the Dark Tower series and I. WILL. LOVE. IT. (Well, apart from Insomnia… I did love the connections, it just didn't save the rest of the book!)As most Constant Readers will know, choosing your top 10 King books is pretty much possible, but I do believe this has now earned a spot in my top 10. It might not be for everyone, but it was really to my taste. It's difficult to review books you really loved, so I guess I'll wrap up here… 5 stars!!!",176,26
10607,Black House,Baba,"3,503",725,4,"August 3, 2022","The weirdest thing about this and The Talisman is Peter Straub's involvement, as the books are so completely entrenched in the Stephen King universe - especially this one!The beams are breaking, the end of the world could be nigh, Roland has formed a new Ka-tet - meanwhile in French Landing someone is kidnapping, eating(!) and killing children and the local authorities and FBI have no clue; enter Mr 'all grown up' since The Talisman, and also a retired hero cop, Jack Sawyer!A quintessential Stephen King (and Peter Straub) read - a small town is under siege by a monster living among them; there's an outsider (Sawyer) who some love and some hate; there's a White Hat with a disability; there's kids in peril... oh, and at least one dumb cop :). More horror focused than The Talisman, and more compelling with a freer flowing story, the Detective Columbo-esque approach of identifying the killer very very early on fits well in the context of this story. All in all, a very good read, further enhanced by huge Dark Tower ties. 8 out of 122019 read; 2006 read; 2003 read",151,6
10607,Black House,Tim,"2,084",188,5,"September 13, 2018",This is just further proof that Stephen King is a master author. Lots of action in this 2001 - 500+ page thriller and Frank Muller is incomparable as narrator. 9 of 10 stars,90,8
10607,Black House,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"November 27, 2020","Black House (The Talisman #2), Stephen King, Peter StraubBlack House is a horror novel by American writers Stephen King and Peter Straub. Published in 2001, it is the sequel to The Talisman. This is one of King's numerous novels, which also include Hearts in Atlantis and Insomnia, that tie in with the Dark Tower series. After the events of The Talisman, Jack Sawyer has repressed the memories of his adventures in The Territories and his hunt for the Talisman as a twelve-year-old boy, though the residue of these events has served to subtly affect his life even after he has forgotten them. Jack grew up to become a lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department, where his professionalism and uncanny talent have helped him establish a nearly-legendary reputation. When a series of murders in Los Angeles are traced to a farm insurance salesman from French Landing, Wisconsin, Jack cooperates with the French Landing Police to capture the killer. While in Wisconsin, Jack is irresistibly enraptured by the natural beauty of the Coulee Country, echoing his reaction to The Territories as a child. When he later intrudes upon a homicide investigation in Santa Monica, certain aspects of the crime scene threaten to revive his repressed memories. He subsequently resigns from the LAPD, and he moves to French Landing to enjoy his early retirement.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و نهم ماه می سال 2009میلادیعنوان: خانه سیاه؛ نويسنده: استیون کینگ؛ پیتر استراب؛ مترجم: کتایون نصیری مجد؛ ویراستار علیرضا عامری؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، زهره، 1386، در 766ص؛ شابک 9789642981045؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان امریکایی سده 21مداستانی ناباورانه، درباره ی پسر جوانی، به نام «جک سایر» است؛ «جک» با درجه ی ستوانی، در اداره ی پلیس «لس آنجلس» پذیرفته شد، جاییکه حرفه ای بودن، و توانایی کم مانند او، به او یاری رساند، تا نامدار و نام آوری افسانه ای شود؛ هنگامی که یک سری از قتلها، در «لس آنجلس» رخ داد، «جک» با پلیس «ویسکانسین»، همکاری خویش را آغاز میکند؛ تا قاتل را شناسایی و دستگیر نمایدتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 06/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",74,N/A
10607,Black House,Kenny,485,811,5,"July 24, 2022","What you love, you must love all the harder because someday it will be gone.Black House ~~ Stephen King & Peter StraubLast year, I finally made my first trip to Stephen King's universe by reading THE TAILISMAN. I wish I had read King's works in my teens. They would have been amazing trips for a 13 year old boy to take. Since visiting the Territories, I have journeyed to 'SALEM'S LOT & now, French Crossing. I have many more trips planned with King. Once more, I was completely absorbed in the worlds King created.Stephen King & Peter Straub collaborated on THE TAILISMAN, a story about the fantastic travels of a young boy named Jack Sawyer. In BLACK HOUSE, King and Straub tell the tale of the adult Jack. Wisely, they revisited Jack Sawyer decades later in life, making him a creature of this earth due to an understandable, but selective amnesia where the Territories are concerned. Exhausted by the horrors he's encountered as a successful homicide detective, Jack has retired ~~ quite young ~~ to the hoped-for peace and obscurity of small town Wisconsin life. He's found a dear friend in an older blind man ~~ an oddly elegant music buff who anonymously channels a handful of divergent personalities to whom radio listeners for miles tune religiously ~~ think of him as Wolf in human form. And now, Jack is beginning to feel at home in his new surroundings.The older Jack is a fascinating & complex protagonist. He is intelligent, compassionate, and confused, relying on intuition and luck to resolve conflicts. Once he understands what he must do, he never waivers, exuding confidence and leadership qualities around his companions. Jack’s numerous memories from the Territories, though rarely complete, set him apart from other humans. His fearlessness is both exaggerated and inspiring, yet he is impatient at times, losing his temper and hiding his past.While BLACK HOUSE is considered to be a sequel to THE TAILISMAN. I’d be reluctant to describe it this way. The story-line is loosely connected to THE TAILISMAN in that it contains recurring characters ~~ Jack Sawyer & Parker/Parkus ~~ & features a few trips to the Territories but that's it. BLACK HOUSE uses an unusual & distinctive narrative point-of-view. The story is initially written from the viewpoint of a crow ~~ a familar the serial killer calls Gorg that lures children for him ~~ so everything’s written as if you’re flying above the action and swoop into to take a closer look ~~ moving towards the sun, we glide away from the river. Once Jack enters the story, the narative changes & the story becomes easier to follow.Part of the brilliance of BLACK HOUSE is how it works on several levels ~~ murder mystery, character study, fantasy, horror story; it is both separate from & bound to THE TALISMAN . BLACK HOUSE is an exciting read, & quite scary as well. One of the most intreguing aspects of BLACK HOUSE is in its references to classic literature. THE TALISMAN relied heavily on the work of Mark Twain; here, King and Straub reference both Poe & Dickens. The titles similarity to Bleak House is not incidental; the scarier sections of BLACK HOUSE parallels the foggy, damp descriptions of Dickens' ghost stories. Also similar to Dickens is the technique of establishing places, & in which the sprawling cast of characters is introduced. With Jack being introduced late in the story, we grow attached to these people instead of being shown who they are in relation to Jack.BLACK HOUSE is a challenging, complex read ~~ much more challenging than THE TALISMAN & 'SALEM'S LOT . Readers are richly rewarded with an engrossing tale written by two masters at the top of their game.",72,4
10607,Black House,Ron,375,83,4,"October 1, 2017","Each time I pick up a Stephen King book, I am struck by the different writing voice I find. Truth is, I had expected it with Black House, sort of, being co-written with Peter Straub, and yet I was struck all the same. King/Straub narrate much of this tale from a moving bird’s-eye perspective, floating in and out of each character’s stance and location, with a twinge of humor on the side. They don’t even try to hide the fact that this account has been written in a book, by two writers even. I thought this was funny, and I thought the style of writing was unlike many of the other King works before it. Believe me, I tried to deduce who wrote what. Was this King’s chapter, or was it Straub’s? “King-ism’s” came through of course. They always do. But overall, I could not tell. Then I found the reason why - while watching an interview of Stephen and his son Owen no less. Even they could not tell who had written what when looking back at their new book Sleeping Beauties. During their collaboration, they had edited and rewritten one other’s work along the way, thereby melding it. There was the answer.How did Black House fare compared to The Talisman? Pretty well, I’d say. Here’s the part where I admit that I cannot remember much of The Talisman. I am bummed about that, but just a little. Although I think it’s more than a good idea to read The Talisman first, it’s not going to kill the story if you happened not to. Black House looks back at the twelve year old Jack Sawyer and his quest across America, while creating a whole new chapter in the process. Jack is now an adult with no memory of the long ago journey to save his mom’s life. (Don’t worry Jack, I forgot too!) But his memory will return, and with it will come the recollection of that other world called The Territories. And as I read about his recollection, these words came through: 
  ”There are other worlds than these.”
 That is not a line taken from Black House, although it could easily be one. The quote belongs to Jake Chambers from The Gunslinger. I bring this up because the story of Black House fits so well with The Dark Tower series. I don’t think there’s another book outside of the series that is closer to it than this one. The Talisman may be in some ways, but it seems to me that half the purpose of Black House is to tell a story of The Dark Tower that needed telling. Fine by me. Some of the things in those other worlds are a little bit “out there”, so to speak. Weird creatures. Wild ideas. And that’s fine too, cause the stories are always strong. Like this one.",52,26
10607,Black House,Becky,"1,308",1595,4,"April 24, 2016","It's been a long time since I read this book. I remember reading it when it first came out, when I was in my late teens, and really enjoying it, but it's clear that I forgot sooo much about this book. I remember this one having more to do with the Dark Tower - but just how much, and in what detail surprised me. I almost wish that I hadn't read it now, that I'd waited until later on in my upcoming Dark Tower re-read with my bookclub, so I could read it at a more appropriate place within the Dark Tower timeline. But oh well. Sometimes one must live with the choices that are made. It's not really fair to call this book a sequel to The Talisman. I don't know what else to call it, because it IS that... but it sets the expectation that it will be similar to The Talisman, and it's not at all that. Talisman was an adventure, a quest, and yes, there was some dark and grim stuff in there (The Elroy Thing, Sunlight Gardener, Morgan & Morgan, etc) and but it never felt hopelessly grim and depraved. This does. Not that I'm complaining, I loved it. But this is the evil twin that has been kept in the attic and fed fish heads making its appearance after 20 years. It came from the same stock, but it's not friendly or altogether sane. This is a dark book. It's a slow burn of a book. It's a character study book. It's a police-procedural-in-hell book. It's a Dark Tower book. It's a Stephen King book... so I don't know why anyone would expect anything less than the previous statements. We pick back up with Jack Sawyer 20 years after we left him, and he has made a career and a life for himself as a homicide detective. He's forgotten - or blocked - all memories of his previous quest to save his mother, and has tried to live as normal and mundane a life as possible, despite the fact that he had touched the Talisman, and it conferred a lasting good luck on him that made everything he wanted to do that much easier. However, Jack has pulled the plug on his career after seeing a black man murdered on the Santa Monica Pier and it dredges up some memories of Speedy Parker - and he gets the hell out of dodge. Moves to an idyllic little town in Wisconsin and never plans to be a cop again. Except of course for the fact that Ka is a wheel and he doesn't have a choice. Someone is killing children in his new hometown, and of course nothing is ever what it seems when King's writing. What follows is a grim, but excellent story that builds and builds. We encounter some old friends, make a lot of new ones (and more than a few enemies as well) and shit gets real. And surreal. I don't really want to talk too much about the plot or the story because it's best if one experiences it for themselves. It is a great book, and can stand alone - though you will get much more out of this if you are familiar with Jack's history. I loved most of the characters in this book, even the ones I detested. Wendell Green and Charles Burnside, I'm looking at you. In that order. Charles is what he is, and he does what he does and there's no punishment harsh enough for that. But for some reason, my disgust and rage really homed in on Green, and I felt like he was the most shitty person in this whole book. All of the other evils were evil, pure and simple. They wanted to kill and destroy and tear down the walls of the universe because that's what evil does. But fucking Wendell Green is just a shitty human who thinks way too highly of himself and is out for blood because he thinks that he's King Shit of Turd Hill - only nobody else recognizes that yet. He's the Rita Skeeter of French Landing. The shitty fucker. Shoulda been left for the Sisters. Just sayin'. ANYWHO... I loved Henry and Beezer and Mouse and Jack and Dale. All of these guys make me so proud of them. Even Bear Girl, in her small, small bit part, impressed me and kind of broke my heart. She's a rock, that girl. I would have liked a bit more about Mr. Munshun and The Big Combination. I wanted a bit more about what that was FOR. Obviously it was EVIL... but just what was it powering? Still... this is a great book, if a little tiny bit draggy at times. Like I said, it's a slow burner of a book. It takes a bit of patience, as often King's books do, but I think they pay off in the end. If I had ONE complaint, it would be the romantic element of the story. Ugh. Come on. It was unnecessary and so obvious and blah blah blah skim. Yeah, I get it, she's pretty... he's pretty... they are ""interesting"" and now instalove. Gag me. Leave out the instalove, and I'm golden. I could not care less. Otherwise, excellent stuff. ",37,5
10607,Black House,Janie Johnson,865,130,2,"January 15, 2015","Wow this book was, simply put, a mess and was very painful to read. Considering I totally enjoyed the Talisman, I expected this book to be just as mind capturing as its predecessor. I was very disappointed in just about the whole story. So it turned out to be 'just ok' for me.The first half was drawn out and very wordy. The coming together of all the characters was quite confusing as well. It seemed to take half of the book before the story even got remotely interesting. It would get good and then would settle back into the wordiness that I found throughout most of the story. Once it did finally reach its peak I was so exhausted, I just wanted the story to end. However, I did enjoy several of the characters in the story. So that was the highlight of the book. If not for them This may not even have reached the 2 star rating I gave it. At the end of the book it felt like it was left pretty wide open for more Of Jack and his adventures in the territories. All I can say about that is I hope King and Straub give us a better tale than they did with Black House. ",34,10
10607,Black House,John,"1,070",76,4,"October 22, 2022","Thoroughly enjoyed the sequel to The Talisman. Jack Sawyer now an adult goes to live in Wisconsin, French Landing. Here he becomes friends with the super cool blind Henry a DJ and Dale the local police chief. A serial killer called the Fisherman is killing children. We then embark on an adventure with Jack as he tries to save Ty the latest kidnapped victim. We cross over to the territories and find the Black House a portal to another dark horrific world. A real page turner with lots of links to the Dark Tower series. ",32,N/A
10607,Black House,Ashley Daviau,"1,728",738,5,"October 9, 2022","This was one of the first King books I read as a pre teen and I read it not knowing it was the sequel to The Talisman. Now that I’ve read The Talisman twice and reread Black House again, it’s like all the puzzle pieces finally fit together just right. I loved Black House but reading it again with all the missing pieces filled in made me love it all that much more, even more so after reading both again. There’s something about this story that just gets under my skin and really creeps me the fuck out! It definitely beats out The Talisman in terms of horror and spook factor in my opinion, it feels like King and Straub really hit their stride as collaborators on this second book and I really wish we had gotten a third before Straub passed away. I could read book after book about this story and be perfectly content to stay immersed in this little dark, double world. Actually, I probably enjoy it so much because it’s really similar to Dark Tower in some ways and that’s never a bad thing.",32,N/A
10607,Black House,Derrick,114,72,5,"August 12, 2022",This book turned out to be absolutely amazing! It was written in a completely different style from any other Stephen King I've read before. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was really cool getting to know things as the reader that the characters didn't necessarily know. It was fun getting to know Jack as an adult. I thought this story worked really well as a sequel. There was lots of references to characters and events from The Talisman. There was also many references to The Dark Tower series which I always love! As always the descriptions and world building were masterfully done. King and Straub are both great at painting a truly stunning word picture. I thought Henry was a super cool character and he helped to make this book so much fun to read. Judy was a great character too and I started to feel so bad for her as the story went on. To be honest most of the characters were pretty awesome. Definitely a five star read! It was a roller coaster of an adventure and will be enjoyed by fans of both King and Straub.,30,2
10607,Black House,Jessica Westwood,94,14,5,"May 26, 2021","Black House has blown me away. My most favourite King's adventure of all time!And I can say with certainty that I would not be saying this if I hadnt of spent years within the weaved web of King's worlds. Its crazy that I have to remind myself that this was co written by Straub also because its had such a massive effect on me due to it been so strongly a part of King's multiverse, his linked novels and his mind.I cant urge you enough to take that step into The Dark Tower series if you are yet to, I promise you it makes reading all King's books a step above any experience you have without doing so. To enter and understand the Black House fully, to gain that higher experience, to get the most enjoyment, you need the knowledge gained from time and years, (if thats what it takes) spent on the Dark Tower journey. And then of course The Tailsman needs to be opened up before finally taking the step into the Black House. Then and only then, I believe, you will be ready for this. Ready for the appreciation of a true authors remarkable craft. King. You really are the master of all masters... For, what is an experience if you only have half the knowledge? *A maybe crazy word to try to understand what it means to me to be a King follower... There is a special feeling created deep within oneself when you are part of a specialised 'group' of people who hold a great understanding and knowledge of a subject. I imagine it to be the feeling created from spending a lifetime of following a religion with an almighty never faultering faith, a higher knowledge, a knowing, a certainty.Okay, okay, yes... Im possibly terrible to compare been an avid Stephen King fan to a religion but thats how Im choosing to compare it. I cant think of any other way to explain how powerfully it makes me feel!Reading the Black House has made me feel so nostalgic of my years gone by, of a much younger me who once decided to pick up the first of many books of The Dark Tower series. The me who over years became the girl who stood beside Roland Deschain and his Ka-tet, who learnt from a true, last surviving gunslinger himself, how to spot the evil eye of The Crimson King, how to be true to oneself on the journey and how to not forget the face of my father. There are not many people I have met face to face over my years in this world that have been on this same journey as I, and when I do come along that someone it creates such a buzz of excitement, a true connection, that I am in the presence of one that has also stepped into this multiverse, who has smelt the surrounding roses, who has rode alongside you on the insane Blaine, who has petted the little billy-bumbler-Oy, one who also knows that all things serve the beam.You finally have someone beside you who understands just how many years you have put into the quest of the beam and the Dark Tower, as they have walked through the same dry and dusty footprints also. It all sounds crazy as Im writing how it makes me feel, many wont get it at all, but for my fellow ka-tet's... I hope you understand. 'Long days and pleasant nights'",27,3
10607,Black House,Dustin,438,168,4,"October 4, 2013"," In the early eighties, Stephen King and Peter Straub embarked on the ultimate coming-of-age tale. The Talisman easily solidified the collaboration's super status. Then, nearly two decades later, they returned to their literary roots. Black House portrays a different Jack Sawyer, now a semi-retired Los Angeles detective. He won't remain there much longer, though. By requesting his expertise in a major case, a colleague-turned-friend leads him to Wisconsin, where his life will be irrevocably altered...in numerous ways.  Black House is very different from its predecessor. One of the most significant changes is the unique writing style. Almost everything's shown by way of what I like to call ""an eagle's eye"" view. This can be somewhat difficult and frustrating to adjust to, and I completely understand that critique. It's also a little slow at first. We're not actually reunited with Jack until the first 60 or so pages.  My first time through the Coulee Country, I struggled with it a bit, too. But it being a King novel, I knew a big payoff was inevitable.  And maintaining his ""I'm retired"" mindset, Jack is reluctant to aid the local police investigation of a string of grisly serial killings. It's only until a young boy is abducted that Jack agrees to assist the authorities. With the addition of a handful of eccentric characters (including the ever positive, delightful, and beloved Henry Lyden,) we're given recurring appearances of one or more characters from The Talisman.  One new addition, named Charles Burnside, alludes to a less than pleasant childhood, leaving something to be desired. I wanted to know more. For instance, how exactly was he mistreated (presuming, of course, that was the case,) what were his parents like? Who were his parents? What events helped form the individual shown throughout the novel? More importantly, can he be empathized with, knowing what we do about him? Should we be expected to? I felt next to nothing for him, whatsoever. Unless my utter abhorrence of him is put into consideration. That particular emotion resonates in every fiber of my being. But if I may return briefly to the aforementioned alluding, my heart does go out to him. Though all too fleeting...  How about his time in Chicago? He displays an abundance of scorn which tells the reader of his pent-up resentment. What specifically happened there, though? That being said, I love the duality of ol' ""burn, burn's"" voices and/or accents. (In general, it's always a pleasure to find elements of duality in fiction, but in this case, I think King and Straub pulled it off exceptionally well.) Reminiscent of some nefarious-yet equally skilled- ventriloquist, the sequence baffles the mind in every sense of the word. Additionally, I think I probably would have been more impacted if our killer had been less supernatural and more human.  Why do I emphasize this point? Because, as of late, I've come to realize that villains who are more less fantastical (Rose Madder's Norman Daniels or The Shining's Jack Torrance, to name a few) have a much larger affect on me.  I almost wish that the killer's identity had been withheld a bit longer. I believe if they'd done so, it would have created a much more suspenseful, biting-your-nails quality. Then again, the story's pretty dark and creepy. King and Straub probably weren't very interested in its mystery; contrarily, this story is very horror-orientated.   All throughout, a recurring theme is explored in interesting way(s:) repressed memories. This literary technique is seen in multiple characters, primarily our protagonist, Jack Sawyer. On a related note, scientific studies indicate that particularly traumatic experiences often result in repression, as a defense mechanism. And speaking personally, I'm a firm believer. I can recall very little of my childhood. I'm not the only one, either. King and Straub said it best: ""Amnesia is merciful."" Indeed.  The final showdown (and the all-important journey toward that end,) felt slightly long-winded, but the psychological aspects almost demand it. As for the battle itself, I am torn. On the one hand, it is quite phenomenal. On the other, there's a comic book quality which renders it somewhat unrealistic. As a result, I'm left with many questions whose answers I'd be interested in learning.  Then, due to unforeseen events, Jack is inadvertently transported back to his past, so to speak. By taking their story in this direction, King and Straub present a few very suspenseful closing pages. I was literally holding my anxious breath and hoping for the best. I also realized the depth of my love and admiration for this amazing man. And through certain revelations, things are left open. There simply MUST be a 3rd book!! Jack's story isn't complete. ",25,50
10607,Black House,Justine,"1,103",294,5,"January 22, 2023","Wow. This book was so good!I liked The Talisman, although it had a bit of a slow/awkward start for me. Black House is just something else entirely. Instead of a quest/portal fantasy centred on a 12 year old boy, we get Jack Sawyer 20 years older and involuntarily involved in a kind of supernatural procedural (with a small side of quest, of course). I loved the connections with The Dark Tower series, which were tantalizing yet inscrutable. I’m so sad that there won’t ever be another book to follow this. There are characters and threads I’m finding it hard to let go of.My first favourite of 2023.",19,2
