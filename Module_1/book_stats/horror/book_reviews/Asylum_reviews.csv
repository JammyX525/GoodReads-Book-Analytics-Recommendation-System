Personally, I found this an enjoyable story, with twists I didn't see coming and an interesting conclusion. I'd recommend it, just maybe not to an elitist book snob.",476,67
13597728,Asylum,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",832,39900,1,"September 7, 2013","The characters in this book are supposed to be 16. This is supposed to be a suspenseful thriller, a horror, for young adults. It is not. It is middle grade in writing. It is elementary in plot development and characterization. It is lacking in everything that would make it anything remotely approaching a good read.The writing is not terrible, just forgettable. I usually use a fair number of quotes in my reviews; I have almost nothing at all scribbled down in my notebook for this one: roughly 15 words total, really. This book, the writing, and the characterization is absolutely lacking in anything memorable; for better or worse. Do yourself a favor and skip it. Don't even glance at it.Oh, I changed my mind. I do have a quote for you. It's not from the book, but it's my personal opinion of that idiotic ending. No spoilers, by the way.“...This type of ending is a special instance of deus ex machina, known as the folie adieu, which is French for ""Are you fucking kidding me?”- Howard MittelmarkThe book fails as a suspense, because within a suspense novel, characterization should be key. There is no character development in this book. The characters do not develop in complexity, they act, they do not think. They do not grow. They do not mature. They are scared, I am not scared for them; I half wished they'd get killed so that there would at least be a spark of excitement in this dull shadow of a horror novel. Stephen King might have written something better in 3rd grade.The characters are strange, I would usually say clichéd, but it's not even that. It is as if the characters cannot decide for themselves which cliché they are supposed to fall into. It is a sad, sad thing when a book fails at writing characters that are so poorly written that they cannot even force themselves into a mold. There is Dan, our main character, a seemingly extra-bright 17-year old, with hints of past psychological trouble. The book is told from his point of view, and he is an utterly unconvincing character. I believe he is a poorly written male character. It is not so much that he acts feminine, or makes observations that are uncharacteristically male (and he does make certain observations about her clothes and hair that do not ring true to a teenaged boy, but there's also something lacking about the way he is written. There is something about every single one of the three main characters, really, that doesn't make them feel real at all.The characters are Dan, the socially awkward but bright teen. Abby, the beautiful, artsy (why are they always fucking artsy?) girl with whom Dan falls into insta-love. Jordan, the brilliant gay math student. The three of them bond almost immediately, but again, we are told this, not shown this. I cannot buy this friendship, the way it was written does not ring true. Their bond feels forced. I neither like nor believe in any of the three as characters, and I do not believe in their friendship for a moment.They lack dynamic. They lack emotion. Their individual personalities are nonexistent. They are words on paper. Even through the eyes of our main character, we get no sense of development, of complexity. If this was a character-driven book, it fails utterly.The romance was forced, and it had no room in the plot. It does not play any role of importance whatsoever, it felt merely inserted in the book for the sake of having romance in a book that needed none, and actually ended up making a bad book even worse with its extraneousness. Their romance, their dates, their strained courtship---had no room in the book short of trying to insert some awkwardness in the already poorly crafted credibility of the dynamic that makes up our not-so-dynamic trio of Jordan, Abby, and Dan.For students supposedly so devoted to the pursuit of advanced education, the three seem in a terrible hurry to throw their summer of education away. They break the rules, despite knowing it would get them into trouble. They make stupid decisions, they overreact for no reason at all. Their apparent reasons for acting outside of their character were forced and not well-written as to create a sensible flow within the book. Everything felt incredibly disjointed.The final nail in this book's coffin is the fact that this book fails in delivering a compelling plot. This book fails as a horror, as a thriller, as a suspenseful book. There is no fear to be found within its pages. The photographs are laughable, and does nothing to add to the atmosphere of the book. They actually make it laughable; the picture of the so-called ""lobotomy"" pictures a girl with a horizontal zigzagging line across her forehead. It looks like someone scrawled a long line of Ws across her forehead; did anyone even bother to research this? There are photographs of other patients, so poorly photographed that they are obviously posed. They do not instill anything within the reader except laughter.The other photographs are that of letters, notes, sceneries. Letters. Yes, I am shaking in my boots. Letters. Terrifying. I'm actually more frightened by the hideous carpets (paisley?!) on which the notes sometimes are photographed.I was an easily scared child. I would say with absolute confidence that my five year old self would not be frightened at anything within this books' pages.The plot revolves around telling, not showing. Suspense is never built. The plot is paper thin, the twists are completely dependent upon our suspension of disbelief. For a horror, there is absolutely no suspense, and no fear. It is reliant upon coincidences and deus ex machina. There is no subtlety in the attempts at giving us hints. It was so very obvious to me from the very beginning as to whom the villain would turn out to be.There is a hint that this will be part of a series. I was barely intrigued enough to keep reading until the end of this book, and I'm about as eager to read the next book as I am anticipating a visit to my dentist. Skip this book.",381,108

13597728,Asylum,Bonnie,"1,370",918,1,"August 16, 2017","A copy of Asylum was provided to me by Harper Children's/Edelweiss for review purposes.The word Asylum alone evokes a feeling of dread. A twinge of apprehension. Unfortunately the title was the only thing that elicited that expected response, because the book was honestly extremely dry and wearisome.The idea behind the story was solid: 16 year-old Dan comes to stay for several weeks over the summer at a college prep program and he finds out their dorms are located in what once was an asylum for the criminally insane. I'm on board with that. The characters completely destroyed this story though. They were dull, uninteresting and lacking in any sort of dimension.The inconsistency of maturity was awful. Dan would be contemplating Jung one minute and acting like a 12 year old boy the next. He is supposed to be this incredibly socially awkward guy that has the hardest time making friends, yet he finds two people and they're the bestest of friends... instantly. They spend all their time together and they even decide to take some of the same classes together and they talk about their family problems with one another and... it just didn't feel authentic. Their friendship itself may have worked, but the fact that we knew they had JUST met ruined it all. Within a week even the teachers have nicknamed them 'The Hydra'. Dan's two friends, Abby and Jordan, also met each other for the first time on the bus that brought them to the school. The nail in the coffin happened for me when about a week into their stay, Abby forgets to tell Jordan that she won't be able to study with him because she's hanging out with Dan instead. She comes home to find him waiting for her outside her dorm door, drinking, proclaiming that she drove him to drink. Their friendship lacked a necessary composition that would generate these types of responses. But honestly, I'm not sure when I would ever put up with that type of behavior from a friend; it was just unnecessary and dramatic. (Also unnecessary was the incredibly forced romance that could have completely been done without.) It seemed incredibly unrealistic how advanced their relationship seemed to be after such a short amount of time and considering this was a huge basis of the story, it practically ruined the story as a whole for me. The comparison to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a bit far-fetched and the only link between the two I could determine was the inclusion of black and white pictures. With Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children though, the pictures felt like they fit with the story much more and appeared to be incredibly authentic. While my ARC copy didn't contain all pictures, the ones I was able to view looked digitally created and many didn't even match up to what was being described which completely defeated the whole purpose. I would consider this to be a far closer match-up to Dennis Lehane's 'Shutter Island'- the YA Version with extremely bad characters.The story was interesting enough but I was really anticipating a much more intense reading experience. The ending doesn't give you all the answers, because apparently this is being made into a series which is completely unnecessary; this could have been a perfect stand-alone story (if it had more solid of characters and maybe a bit more creepy thrown in for flavor). Suffice it to say this was an epic disappointment and I don't consider myself to be interested enough in continuing.

13597728,Asylum,Ashley Daviau,"1,728",738,5,"July 18, 2016","I enjoyed this book much more this time around than the last time I read it. I was itching for a creepy yet easy read and that's exactly what this gave me. I always enjoy it when the plot of a story is centred around an old, dark building with secrets to be uncovered. This provided all of that and more! Add in the slightly disturbing photographs and creepy handwritten notes and I'm 100% sold!",40,N/A
13597728,Asylum,Melanie,589,1030,1,"September 6, 2013","See more reviews at YA Midnight Reads Thank you HarperCollins Australia for sending me this copy. No compensation was given or taken to alter this review. Mini review:I highly recommend Asylum if you want to fall asleep in the middle of the day- which mind you, I haven't done since I was 4 years old, and well, now. This book certainly comes with a lot of nostalgic moments, including a writing style that's vehemently juvenile. But of course, read this book if you're feeling lazy, and don't want to use your brain as Asylum does a perfect job in these two areas. Apart from that, Asylum was flawed in most other aspect which is re-assuredly much more important than a middle-of-day snooze and no-brainer read.What I enjoyed:The one and only legitimate reason to why Asylum was merely bearable was the plot. Sure, it was horribly executed but the mystery was somewhat there and interesting enough for me to want to know the resolution. While it didn't give off the effect of a thrillingly spooky, the mystery part did give this novel some enjoyment- though insanely miniscule.What was just, bleh:I feel Roux created a bunch of world's randomest characters and threw them into the storyline. Our main character, Dan is exceedingly flat. He's meant to be smart but his dialogue and the way he tackles situations is completely hollow and illogical. Moreover, Abby, the love interest had an undeniably stereotypical ego and Jordan, the other friend was more randomer than this book. He'd pop out of nowhere then show up with some irregular behaviour. The protagonists, to be put candidly, were inconsistent and not carefully constructed.Another undoubtedly lousy aspect was the romance. There is not the slightest layer of depth. Instant love really does not go well with underdeveloped characters and childish chemistry. And by childish I mean utterly awkward and laaaaame.The pace. Hot and Cold by Katy Perry is the ideal song to match this aspect. The range of fast to slow is a distinct dynamic here, really. This took major impact in the mystery. Like I aforementioned, the mystery lost its chilling counterpart due to the poor even, pacing.Asylum, is another good potential gone bad. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this. (Heck, I couldn't find much effort in reviewing this either.) ***********LAAAAAAME.",34,8

  No great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness.
I know a lot of people feel that asylum settings in horror are overdone, or insensitive, and I can fully respect that and see where those people are coming from! That said, even as a woman who probably (definitely) would’ve been locked up with the key thrown away if I’d been alive a couple hundred years ago (I say this only half-jokingly 😂), I adore a good retired asylum setting in a scary story, so when I found out about this little series, I was pretty excited to check it out!
  It was a house for those who could not take care of themselves, for those who heard voices, who had strange thoughts and did strange things. The house was meant to keep them in. Once they came, they never left.
And I have to say, the setting in Asylum really is great. It’s claustrophobic at times, atmospheric as anything, and struck me as the kind of place that I would pay good money to be allowed to explore or even just take a tour through. It seemed like a building that absolutely ought to exist in a million places all over the world, run-down and decrepit and probably terrifying the locals on a daily basis. Unfortunately, the positive things I have to say for this book begin and end there.
  It was a fight against the madness, he felt like he was losing. Maybe he already had...
The characters are all solidly awful, and I don’t think I ever had a moment of liking a single one of them. On top of that, I literally predicted the ‘twist’ a few pages into the book, and having guessed it so early on made it difficult to enjoy the rest, because I kept wondering why the hell these teens couldn’t come anywhere near guessing the truth. I was frustrated, disappointed, and altogether unimpressed that I spent my money on this book or its immediate sequel, which I don’t know if I’ll ever even bother picking up.2.5 stars———Buddy read with Kaleena!",34,N/A
13597728,Asylum,Pinky,490,277,2,"July 25, 2015"," I wouldn't say this book is amazing. I mean, I liked the book, but I wasn't attached to it. Before reading this book, I had so many expectations. The characters were likable, but I wasn't completely attached to them. Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the writing style either. From some of the reviews I read, they said that this book was a cheaper version of Miss.Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Unfortunately, I didn't read that book yet so I cannot compare the two. I just didn't enjoy the book as much as I thought I would. It was the reason I was in a reading slump. I kept avoiding the book because I think I got tired of it.  This story is about a boy named Daniel Crawford who is going to summer school. The high school that he is going to is an old asylum, that was renovated into a high school. But parts of the school is not renovated and there are old offices with information about the old asylum. Daniel befriends Abby and Jordan and they go on adventures to the old offices. Throughout the book, there are some images that show where they are. Weird things begin to happy to Daniel and murders begin to occur in the school. Abby, Jordan and Daniel try to figure out what it going on and try to piece everything together. If you think about it, I feel like the summary really gets you. But when I read the book, I just didn't enjoy it. I found it fast-paced, but I didn't feel like I was Daniel. Usually, when I read a book, I feel like I am the main character. But I didn't feel like that in this book and I don't know why. The book was meant to give you the scares, but it didn't scare me. At parts I would get the creeps, but I never felt terrified. When I read the huge plot twist in this story, I felt like I saw it coming. I already knew who was behind the murders and I wasn't surprised. I suspected one character the entire time and I was right. But the thing is, when it comes to suspense and mystery, I want my predictions to be wrong. I want to be shocked and read a huge plot twist that gets me. As you can see, I didn't enjoy this very much. Maybe others may enjoy it but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I am planning on continuing with this series because some reviewers said that it gets better. I am hoping that it does. Wish me luck, and hopefully I wont go into another reading slump! ",28,34

13597728,Asylum,Inês Ferreira,38,40,1,"November 11, 2015","DNF at 50%.This book compares itself to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. Don't even. Just don't.I try really hard to finish this book but I wasn't enjoying reading anymore so I decided to dnf. I usually hate dnf books because they sometimes get better or find some kind of redemption.This book I feel like it would never change. Although the beginning was interesting some problems that I had i though it would be solved at least in half the book (of course it weren't).What was my big problem? well.. THE CHARACTERS.All the characters in the book are quite ""empty"", and they look more younger than they actually are (it gives a vibe of a childrens book, which it wasn't what i was exepted)), but the character that discourage more is the main character, Dan. he irrited me so much in this book. sometimes he acts like a 6 years old, other times he looks very girly and even other times he seemed a weird stalker. The relationship between the characters didn't seem real.It developed too fast to look realistic.Don't recommend this book.",23,8
13597728,Asylum,Krystal,"1,295",338,3,"September 5, 2018","Actually kind of impressed with this Young Adult horror story.Creepy cover ✔Horrible history ✔Mysterious happenings ✔Creepy AF location ✔Terrifying photos ✔The photos definitely make this book a hundred times creepier, even if most didn't really match the story. I think the shudder effect comes from knowing that people and places like this did actually exist once upon a time.For any horror aficionado, haunted asylums aren't really anything new. They arise constantly in books, films, tv shows ... you name it. It's an endless source of fear, possibly because it also forces us to consider what kind of depravity humankind has been responsible for in the past. Those poor departed souls.So it's not a particularly original idea, but there's a reason it's been done on numerous occasions. It's a totally creepy premise.Fun fact: the place I stayed during my first year of uni was actually once an asylum. Not so fun fact: Absolutely zero haunting shenanigans for the entire year I was there. Like, one day I came home from classes and the gas had been left on in the kitchen but I'm pretty sure that was incompetent roomies rather than vengeful spirits.But I digress.One of my favourite songs (aptly titled 'Ghost'), includes the lyrics: We're not afraid of what we know, more what we don't. I think that explains why so many people are fascinated (and easily terrified) by ghosts. Departed souls. Spirits. NO ONE KNOWS. It's a lot harder to stand and fight something that may or may not be there. The best horror stories are the ones where you're not entirely sure what the horror is. Not knowing is part of the fear.I had a few theories in my head reading this, but I was still scratching it by the end. I think that's a lot to do with this being a series: it leads to unanswered questions. I think that's what stopped it from packing a nice hard punch at the end. It kinda tapers out in a weird way and nothing is properly resolved.I liked the characters, but I wasn't too fond of the coincidences. They felt false to me, like the story was trying to hard to link things. I did really appreciate Jordan as a non-conforming character, but I was also thrown by his lack of characterisation. The book kinda tells you he doesn't fit a standard mold but then doesn't give you much more about him? I suspect his personality will come more into play in the sequel. Abby was okay, I liked her just fine, but she was a bit naive for my liking. Dan ... I mean, forgive me for saying so, but the guy seems like a total nut job. I'm definitely keen to see his insanity progress in the next book. (Wait, what?)I guess I really liked the premise and this book scores major points for the creepy factor, but the story itself felt a bit weak to me. Like all the gimmicky stuff came first and then the author was like, 'oh, wait, I guess I kinda need a twisted story to go with this ...' I enjoyed it, and it has some great creepy moments and ideas, but the story is a bit ehhhh. Also weird. Rubbish ending.Hoping the sequel amps up the creepiness and brings a stronger story. I'll definitely be reading it. There's got to be something way more sinister lurking underneath this lil horror story.*rubs hands together in anticipation*",21,N/A
13597728,Asylum,Jon,599,627,1,"November 10, 2014","Check out my blog for this review & so much more!   Rating: A Generous 2.5 Stars As soon as I saw that Asylum was being compared to Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children, I immediately downloaded an ARC of it. Miss Peregrine's is one of my favorite books so I had high expectations for Asylum. I'm sorry to say that Asylum is not the next Miss Peregrine's but it is a pretty good horror/thriller. Miss Peregrine's was such an unique read because all of the photos that accompanied the story were original. Ransom Riggs wrote a story around the creepy photos he had found at flea markets and photograph collectors. It is quite obvious that the photographs in Asylum were staged to complement the story. All of the photos feel very fake and don't really add much to the overall feel of Asylum. There were times when I felt like creepier photos should have been in this book rather than the mundane photos that were included. I know my ARC didn't have all of the interior art and photographs so it's a bit unfair to deride this book based on the visual components.  The characters in this book are definitely developed, but I wasn't the biggest fan of them. Dan acted like a petty child at sometimes and it bothered me how infatuated he was with Abby. Dan would notice such trivial things about Abby's appearance and obsess over it. It was a bit strange in my opinion how he fawned over her hair and how wavy it was. Last time I checked this isn't normal behaviour for a teenage guy. Abby was kind of a strange character but I still kind of liked her. I didn't understand why Dan was so enamored with her but she was definitely an interesting character. I felt like Jordan got the short end of the stick in this book because even though he is a main character, at times he felt kind of arbitrary. There were pages and pages went by where the author didn't even mention Jordan and I really wanted to know what was going on with him. He wasn't under-developed but I would have liked to see his character furthered in this book.  Asylum is a well-done mystery-thriller-horror combination and the plot is executed extremely well. There was a perfect balance of thrill and macabre ingrained in the plot but there were still moments where I felt a need to roll my eyes. Asylum is a very original novel but it still has some of the horror movie cliches. Seriously why would you enter an abandoned mental asylum alone? Besides the cliches, the plot was pretty original and enjoyable up until the ending. The ending felt like a total cop out and just a lame way to expand this book into an entire series. I seriously feel like this book would have worked better as a stand-alone, does every YA book need to be apart of a series? Whatever happened to good ol' stand-alones?  Bottomline: I enjoyed Asylum for the most part and I will reluctantly read the sequel. Asylum is a fast-paced thriller with just enough spookiness to give readers chills. This book isn't the next Miss Peregrine's but it's definitely a must-read for horror fans. ",18,N/A
13597728,Asylum,Jessie,18,1 follower,1,"September 2, 2013","I cannot stress this enough - this is a horrible and poorly executed book, particularly in that there is no way to get a refund for the time I spent reading it. Time that would have been better spent on, oh, maybe reading nutritional facts on a cereal box or perusing depressing obituaries in the newspaper. While the cover sports an eerie image and promises disturbing found photographs to enhance the story - reminiscent of Ransom Riggs' technique in Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children - the author fails to deliver on this at all. The characters are underdeveloped and rather unlikeable. Despite the fact that you can easily ascertain where the story is heading within the first few chapters, the storyline is plodding at best and fails to pick up the pace until you are more than two-thirds of the way through the book. Even then the supposed plot ""twists"" were weak and grossly underutilized. Between the lackluster writing, uninspiring characters, and tediously predictable plot, the only satisfying aspect of the book's ending was that my suffering in reading it was finally over.",18,5
