  Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.
 (Am I the only one who gets chills??)Abraham Lincoln was a little more than a child when his mother passed due to a mysterious illness. Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, her death was due to a  vengeful vampire. Abraham does what any sensible child would've done - pledged himself wholly and completely to eradicating the entire world of vampires. As expected, plenty of heads rolled and bodies dismembered - thoroughly enjoyable! While I normally feel a bit...odd...when fictionalized accounts make light of serious topics (i.e. slavery) - but this book does it in a tolerable way. How? The accuracy. Grahame-Smith intersperses real-world events with his fictionalized account of Lincoln. So, despite the axes flying, I was learning about history and Lincoln's life. I'm convinced he's a very clever history teacher.Well done and I look forward to reading more of his novels!Audiobook commentsWell-read with great diction and enunciation. I am convinced they brought back ol' Honest Abe to read his audiobook.YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads",109,7

I'm a little embarrassed to admit that this is the first book I read about our 16th president and the Civil war, not including textbooks. Also, my first by the author. I've been wanting to read this for some time because I'm a fan of the film adaption which is equally awesome. There is definitely greater detail in the book/audiobook with footnotes that are informative and I THINK many parts are true. There are photographs and illustrations as well, I'm glad I grabbed the print edition too.I love the creativity and I was fully immersed in this story. Lincoln pwned it and kick those vampire butts, it's entertaining!!! A prominent supporting character, Henry is my favorite, and I wish there was more of him. Love the ending!üíìüé©ü™ì",81,14

    ""Without death,"" he answered, ""life is meaningless. It is a story that can never be told. A song that can never be sung. For how would one finish it?""
  
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is an impeccable example of how history can be made interesting with strategy. Even though I'm vastly interested in history, reading huge textbooks or listening to commentaries still makes me sleepy. I've read about how Lincoln died many times now, from different sources, but I never understood why it happened. I also never really knew much about him other than he was a former U.S President. I'm sure that if I grew up in the U.S then I would have vast knowledge of him, but sadly I didn't. I heard that this book was heavily researched on, so I'm guessing I now have at least a brief introduction on who Lincoln was as a President. Events were obviously coated with the vampire-fantasy gimmick, but I still see some as real events that happened. Before reading this I already knew I was going to enjoy it. The premise was straightforward and it caught my interest immediately. Despite numerous 1-2 star reviews, I went ahead and decided to read this book anyway. Such a great decision I made.The writing was near perfect. The way that the author alternated from his narration and Lincoln's journal was very interesting. If it was an attempt to maintain the reader's interest, then he clearly succeeded, at least with me. I'm clearly happy with the historical vibe of the novel, and the way that it didn't venture out of it. Some other authors would mistakenly write about things that are not present in the time that they're trying to portray. I didn't see anything wrong with SG-S' writing, so I'm clearly satisfied.The plot was in parr with the premise. It showed Lincoln's life, as a vampire hunter. A parody but life lessons were still present. That's the great thing about reading fiction, not only does it interest you, but it also teaches. If I were to quote all of the things I thought were life lessons then this review wouldn't be a review, but rather a short preview. All you need to know is that it was really amazing. Here's one of my favorites though:
   """"Judge us not equally, Abraham, We may all deserve hell, but some of us deserve it sooner than others."" 
The characters were all interesting and genuine. Genuine in a way that they weren't pretentious. The author also didn't make them seem unbelievable. Another reason why I like the writing of this novel. Also the way that Abe developed was really good. It was very well incorporated to the vampire aspect of the novel. No cheesy vampire romance here. The vampires are violent and merciless. I would also like it mention that the author was rather harsh with the outcome of some characters. I'm not sure if they really happened, but the harshness managed to interest me too. I don't have a faint heart, and the darker the novel the better, for me.I can't wait the read the sequel of this. I heard though that it can be read as a standalone, considering it's Henry's point of view, and that makes me even more excited. I really liked Henry here, so reading about the what he decides to do after  Abraham's death  is clearly exciting. I'm glad the author made a sequel about him.5/5 stars. This is my first read of Seth Grahame-Smith, and clearly it's not going to be my last. He managed to exceed my expectations. I don't give out 5 stars that often, but this novel clearly deserves it. Highly recommended. Will probably read this again in the future. ",80,13
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,Lyn,"1,845",16300,3,"February 22, 2019","The Abenator! Very entertaining, very original, and lots of fun. As hilariously irreverent as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, yet like that mash-up Grahame-Smith has woven his adaptions seamlessly into the original and his interjected dialogue sounds correct. Especially noteworthy was the infusion of historical personages into his narrative, some vampires and some not.Clearly well researched, this is a great read for Abe fans and vampire aficionados alike.",78,4
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,John,88,8,4,"May 16, 2010","I came across this book at Barnes & Noble while I was at Union Station in DC and had to call a friend who has encyclopedic knowledge of books of this genre.I was pulled in immediately by the cover and decided that I was going to buy it on my way home.How could you not want to read a book about someone like Lincoln, who seemingly faced tragedy upon tragedy in his personal life only to be doubly tested in his political life.The book is built on the premise that Lincoln kept a series of secret journals over his lifetime chronicling his life-long battle against the dark forces of vampires, including their role in the Civil War and the perpetuation of slavery.While the premise is, of course, ludicrous, I found I just couldn't put the book down. As if Lincoln needed another dimension added to his heroic and tragic life.Honest Abe is helped during his vampire hunt by the mysterious Henry, a vampire himself. Sprinkled throughout the book are clever illustrations and ""actual"" photos. Oh, Photoshop.Anyway,if you like history mixed with a good dose of fantasy, you should pick this up.Also, check out this silly promotional video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X58RPS...",75,12
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,Matthew,"1,219",8681,4,"July 4, 2018","On the 4th of July it seems appropriate to go back and write a review on a book with one of our American presidents at the center of the action. Maybe it would have been a little more appropriate on President's Day, but the 4th is a good secondary option.The genre of alternate history/retelling the classics with monsters at the center of the story has become quite popular over the past decade. While these titles interest me, I approach them with skepticism - is the gimmick going to lead to a good story or a sloppy tale thrown together for a quick buck? Luckily, my experience with these had been pretty good so far!I thought this book was great! Sure, a little cheesy and hokey at moments, but what a fun ""what if"" story: Abraham Lincoln doing everything we know him for, but also kicking vampire ass in the process. And, the format is really cool, too. It is told like it really is an uncovered history of the life of Lincoln. In fact, if the human race went extinct and aliens showed up and found this book, I think they would believe this is a true historical document!If you like alternative history, vampires, and Abraham Lincoln - this is for you! Fun, action packed, and it might even make you think a bit about ""what if Lincoln really did battle these creatures of the night?""If you are a history purist or have difficulty approaching retellings/alternate history with an open mind, this is not the book for you.Note: the other monster based retelling I have read is Pride, Prejudice, and Zombies, and it is pretty good, too!",62,6
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,"Jackie ""the Librarian""",860,256,2,"August 13, 2012","Brilliant premise, but oh-so-clunky in execution. This mish-mash of historical texts and vampire hunting action chugged along dutifully to the end, much like a dry textbook on U.S. History. With vampires. I think my biggest gripe is that we are told again and again how great a man Lincoln is, how he could win over a crowd with his electrifying oratory, and yet we aren't shown it. I wanted to feel it, with examples, not the author's assurances. I also felt like Lincoln was kept at a distance from the reader emotionally. Yes, we are told how much the deaths of his sons devastated him, but we don't see it. And because the book tries to cover Lincoln's entire life, we rush from point to point, so abruptly Lincoln is older and no longer fighting vampires, without the story establishing how we got there with details and Lincoln feeling stiff and sore in the mornings. Or something, you know what I mean. Which is a shame, because Abraham Lincoln had a very interesting life in its own right, even without vampires. I wish the author had given up the mock textbook approach, and just written it straight, somehow. I actually liked the intro, where the premise is that author is given some old notebooks which turn out to be Abraham Lincoln's secret vampire hunter journals. Sadly, we never get back to that, but I think maybe Seth Grahame-Smith is now a vampire, too. Does anyone know if he's taken to wearing sunglasses? P.S. The altered photos are hokey. ",57,5
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,Heidi The Reader,"1,366",1413,3,"June 27, 2017","Take Abraham Lincoln and his famous rail-splitting ax, add a dash of vampires and voila: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.Fans of horror may enjoy this creative re-mix of history more than I did. Though I enjoyed learning about Lincoln, the moments of gore inbetween weren't for me.I listened to the audiobook and my favorite parts were the Americana inspired musical interludes between some of the chapters. Banjos or plaintive violins shepherded readers into the next section. It was beautiful.As for the story itself, I suppose I didn't realize how easy it was to introduce vampires into every moment of a person's life.Example: Last night I had trouble sleeping. I opened my eyes at 3:45 a.m. and whispered to myself, ""The vampires must be closer than I thought.""Or, another real example, there was a terrible accident yesterday in which one of the bar owners in my small hometown was killed riding her motorcycle. I turned to my coworker with a grim look and said, ""Vampires.""See? You can vampire-ize anything!Food goes bad in the refrigerator? Vampires. Cat pukes behind the bed? Vampires. Traffic is bad? Vampires.Though it was fun at first, it became ridiculous.But don't let me deter you- if you like horror, you may love this. I enjoyed it but, I confess, I've had enough vampires to last me for the foreseeable future.",47,3
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,seak,429,475,2,"April 27, 2012","Slowly, I'm getting my blog reviews up here. Here's one from 2 years ago almost to the day. It's always nice to be a couple years ahead of the curve. :DLike I said before, I'm not immune to peer pressure. The opposite is in fact true. I also realize this is probably getting as annoying as hearing about how busy people are and excuses as to why there's no posting. I'll attempt to refrain (doh!).Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter tells the story found in Lincoln's secret journal describing his alternate life as a vampire hunter. Personally, anything titled ""Vampire Hunter"" should really be more entertaining than this.I don't know if by reading Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter I would really be able to have an opinion of the rest of the monster mash-ups as Vampire Hunter is based on Lincoln's life and not another book like Pride and Prejudice. I assume as much though and as such, you'll probably not see many more mash-ups reviews.I have to admit I wasn't converted. First, I wasn't a huge fan of the narrator. The voices he used were just all off for me. I have a certain voice for Abraham Lincoln in my head (probably thanks to School House Rock or something) and this did not do it for me.Next, I have to say the writing was done well and while I was impressed with the facts of Lincoln's actual life that are woven into the story (I did confirm a few), it was hard to take someone telling the actual thoughts and motivations behind Lincoln's actions especially regarding vampires.As mentioned earlier, I guess I expected more action and adventure, less plodding along and talking. Now that I think about it, the ""Abraham Lincoln"" part really should have off-set the rest of the title enough. Don't get me wrong, I greatly respect President Lincoln and I think that may have been one of the reasons I had a hard time with the book as well.One of the perks of the audiobook was that there's an interview with Seth Grahame-Smith at the end of the telling of the story and that was pretty interesting. He tells how the two books he saw everywhere for the last while have been Abraham Lincoln biographies and Twilight. Thus we have Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Also interesting to note Grahame-Smith has a MTV show in the makes.EDIT: It used to be TV show, now obviously it's been made into a movie, which let's be honest, I have to see. You can't read a book no matter how much you liked it or didn't like it and not see the movie. It's in the rules, I'll have to show it to you some day.When Should You Read/Listen to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter?I can probably mostly compare Vampire Hunter to The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova. It's similar slow-moving vampire hunting, so if you liked the latter, you'll probably enjoy the former. Although I would not wish The Historian on my worst enemy. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was a step up from that to be fair.2 out of 5 Stars (It was okay)",46,29
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,Mike (the Paladin),"3,145",1783,1,"July 19, 2010","Here I go again...braving the waters of controversy in a skiff of electrons.... I know a lot of you like this book, some of you like it immensely. It caught my eye because (let's face it) this is less than usual subject matter. I suppose I expected the topic to be dealt with in a somewhat tongue and cheek manner. I'm not familiar Seth Grahame-Smith's other work, none of the others caught my interest. I'm not, after all a Jane Austen fan and I am relatively conservative, so his prior works just didn't ""grab me"". I suppose there are several things that rubbed me the wrong way about this novel, but the biggest problem I had/have with it goes back to its approach and the things it attempts to portray or more accurately the way it portrays them. As I said, I was expecting a tongue in cheek approach to the subject. Instead the author approached the story in a straight, deadpan, alternate history way. In my opinion the book ends up not only taking an axe to vampires, but also to Abraham Lincoln's reputation. I noticed another reviewer who pointed out that in the novel the writer manipulated events in President Lincoln's life so that each act, action, and decision was somehow provoked by vampires...even his rejection of slavery (the slaves that were trying to steal the flat boat were not just fleeing slavery, they were fleeing for their lives from the vampiric overseer. Personally I'd guess that in the case of most humans slavery itself would be enough to flee.) He also points out in one ""episode"" that ""Abe was not as honest"" as he has been portrayed. We at times, get a portrait in this book of an Abraham Lincoln who apparently buys into a ""the ends justify the means"" attitude and that repels me. There are other smaller gripes that have to do with literary flourishes and warped folklore, but it seems everyone today who writes about vampires ""rewrites"" the lore. Not something I particularly like, but neither is it something I'd drop a rating to 1 star for. I came to a place here that I just didn't want to finish the book. There were some predictable parts, some annoying parts, but mostly I didn't like the picture I was seeing in the rewritten/recreated 16th president. President Lincoln is not a fictional character to be ""reimagined"". Usually in historical fiction or alternate history the ""main players"" are respected and unless it's actually a ""hit piece"" (which I have seen) there is an attempt to write true to character. If that is present here, Mr. Grahame-Smith sees an Abraham Lincoln that I don't recognize. Maybe had the book been more of a ""lighthearted"" read, not taking itself so seriously, but as it is I not only don't care for it...I don't care to finish it.",41,43
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,amy e.,4,3,4,"February 21, 2012","I usually don't read biographies or vampire lit. My boyfriend's mom passed along ""Abraham Lincoln"" Vampire Hunter,"" and I politely accepted. I remember rolling my eyes the first time I spied the flashy cover in the Minneapolis airport. Some weeks prior in a pitifully sparse lit section of Borders I realized the tremendous volume of vampire-themed novels. Author Seth Grahame-Smith is not alone. Authors are courting vampires like David Letterman and production assistants. I've never opened a novel from the Twilight Series, but something about the staid idolatry of our 16th president and his vast significance over Robert Pattinson made me consider giving this vampire novel a whirl. To put it concisely, it was a fun read! My complaint is that although Grahame-Smith easily works Lincoln's personal life into the tragic and grutesque lore of vampires (and/or vice-versa), identifying vampires as the pundits behind the Civil War, or rather, slavery, is perhaps not a part of history to be revising. Conspiracy theorists weave grandiose hypotheses to alieviate the chaos and powerlessness of human beings in our sometimes irrational world. Horror novels and films may provide us with a completely reversed comfort, suggesting that man cannot be responsible, cannot accomplish almost unimaginable inhuman atrocities. In fact, we know man certainly can. Slavery exemplifying the evil of which humans, not mythical beings, are capable. ",35,2
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,Monica (is working the heck out of  ,227,82,4,"February 21, 2020","Well, a quick scan of the reviews indicated a general distaste for this book; many people touched on things I imagined would really bug me.	So, I went into this one excited but still prepared to be bored and annoyed.	I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it.	The audible edition employs dramatic music in places that make for a richer, more immersive experience; Smith relies quite heavily on pathos to convey critical parts of the story, and the music contributes to this effort.	As with most historicals, I had to, well, historicize, meaning I had to grit my teeth at the blatant racism and sexism.	I do appreciate Smith‚Äôs choice to eschew the n word (not that negro is all that much better, but themz the times) and that 19th century sentiments regarding womanhood were mostly, and infrequently, implied rather than stated.	I also appreciate that Smith avoids the all too typical conflation of abolitionism with antiracism and, more importantly, that he, for the most part, takes care to depict Lincoln as he was(meaning he does not try to convince readers that Lincoln was some kind of civil rights leader who believed in and advocated for total equality between blacks and whites), not as some people would like him to have been.	And yeah, I know what the ending suggests, but it works because there was, presumably, some kind of epiphany about the ‚Äúnegro‚Äôs‚Äù ‚Äúmoral‚Äù and ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù capacity.	So, why isn‚Äôt this a five-star read? Well, Smith opens the novel with a story of a struggling writer who, estranged from his wife and child and stuck working in a general store in a backwater town, needs a break in the worst way. 	One day, a smooth and mysterious man by the name of Henry Sturges happens into the store and, after a series of getting-to-know-you exchanges, offers this writer the opportunity of a lifetime.	Cut to a creepy, Interview with a Vampire‚Äôesque confrontation between Henry and this writer (remember the final scene between Brad Pitt and Christian Slater?). This is where we leave the writer and go back in time.	Only, we don‚Äôt return. We have no idea what becomes of the writer. Did Henry kill him? Did he turn him? Did the writer do anything meaningful with the contents of the package he received? How is it that we have access to the contents of said package? After all, we have no idea when or if the writer ever completed his task.	Who are the 12 people with whom the writer was authorized to discuss the contents of the package?	I get that leaving questions unanswered is a convention of contemporary literature, but this is a huge, huge plot hole, one that a content editor should have plugged.	I also don‚Äôt know how I feel about Lincoln becoming the one thing he swore to eradicate.	All in all, it‚Äôs flaws aside, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a great book, one with some serious re-readable qualities. four stars.",26,3
7108001,Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter,Viridian5,748,8,1,"November 3, 2014","Seth Grahame-Smith's Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter had a prominent display place in my local library, which is how I picked it up but still haven't read Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. It's a ripping yarn but the way Grahame-Smith has vampires involved in slavery and the Civil War shifts real historical figures' motives in ways I dislike and can't approve of. I felt that it cheapened things. I hated the ending, seeing it as out of character for Lincoln as he's presented in this book as well as cheesy, and the framing device that opens the book felt superfluous and incomplete and didn't really work for me. In the acknowledgments the author himself admits that Lincoln lived a life that ""hardly needed vampires to make it incredible,"" and I left the book firmly agreeing with that sentiment. He should have left well enough alone.I can't recommend Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. It left a bad taste in my mouth. ",26,4

What I thought was going to be a ""light-hearted"" and almost humorous vampire story actually turned out to be a fairly compelling read that interweaves and connects the battle to end slavery with the battle to destroy vampires. I think if you go into the story without any preconceptions, you will have a pretty good time with it. I also thought that the last line of the book was worth half a star all by itself. A final note, I listened to the audio version of this book read by Scott Holst and I thought he did a good job with the book. ",23,1 comment
