32767,At the Mountains of Madness,Jennifer,252,41,2,"August 6, 2014","Imagine: Your friend goes to Antarctica with a team of scientists and discovers the remains of a before-the-dawn-of-time alien civilization AND then finds the ripped up bodies of some team members lying around AND then was chased by the lost alien forms. Cool. Except, your ""friend"" doesn't want to tell you about any of that. All he wants to do is describe the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built: So you're like, no, go back to the part about the ripped up bodies.And he's like, no, let me tell you more about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built. And you say, tell me more about the gigantic albino penguins.And he says, haven't I told you about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built yet? Tell me more about your team members and that one guy you were with when that blob monster chased you! No, I need to tell you about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built when the light hits it at 2:31 p.m.Tell me more about what happened with that monster!And he's like, I think I need to tell you about the icy, mountainous, eerie, tunneled landscape that Roerich built when the light hits it at 2:36 p.m. By that point you're like, That's OK! I've gotta go clean my fish tank now or something...and you're not my friend anymore...(and who the heck is Roerich?)By the time I reached the last part of this book, I really didn't care about the story or what was to be found in the grandest, deepest, most ancient of all chambers in Antarctica that he was leading up to. I didn't care what his teammate saw that he REFUSED to talk about. And I didn't care about the ENTIRE history of this civilization that he somehow managed to decipher from pictographs off a wall in less than a day. Perhaps the writer was trying to create suspense throughout the story, but I just felt teased and strung along for most of it. ",996,106
32767,At the Mountains of Madness,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,4,"February 6, 2022","Cosmic horror at it´s best, silently researching, cave climbing, more and more frightened protagonists stumbling in the face of the old, immortal evil lurking out there, somewhere, always hungry, watching, never sleeping. Madness and genius go hand in hand and it would be unfriendly to say that it´s good that Lovecraft was a bit special, somewhat egocentric, let´s face it, who cares about political correctness and politeness, totally bonkers, because without this special mindset he would certainly not have been able to produce such mindpenetrating, disturbing, and suspenseful masterpieces.The lesser action is needed, the better the author, and that´s where Lovecraft shines, using minimalistic, sometimes even not even real plots and just imagining any creepy detail, danger, or higher demonic entity possible. The thing is that we don´t know, that he could be right, and that I´ve seen similar descriptions of the big, close to almighty evil in some of my favorite sci-fi series when it´s about describing the strange mentality of aliens evolved hundreds of millions and billions of years before humans.It´s funny, we know nothing, so there is also absolutely nothing improbable about a species that had our current state of technological evolution 1,5 or 2 billion years ago and is now a kind of dark, mad, or just sadistic source code of the galaxy, manipulating everything by some kind of extremely advanced Clarketech. Some more sci-fi elements in this work include are aliens manipulating everything from primitive to human (higher primitivity, pseudo sophisticated) evolution, wherever there is a difference, aliens battling on and about earth for eons and leaving relicts, building colonies there, having left other, psychic manifestations, influenced, controlled, manipulated the whole, ridiculously short, human history, are still there, and many other implications.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...",195,6

6.0 stars. As I was experiencing Lovecraft’s supremely awesome, nightmarish masterpiece, At the Mountains of Madness (ATMOM), it really struck me for the first time that he was a tremendously literate writer. I have been a fan of Lovecraft for a long time and have always been gaga for his bizarre imaginative stories. However, what jumped out at me on this reading of ATMOM was how impressively Lovecraft enhances the sense of dread that hangs over his stories through the colorful, melodramatic language he employs. He had a real gift for the written word. To demonstrate HPL's expertise with dramtic language, I have put together a few examples of quotes from ATMOM along with a more straight-forward, less colorful approach that a lesser ""non-awesome"" writer (NAW) might employ. EXAMPLE 1NAW: ""Finally, we arrived at the South Pole."" 
  
HPL: ""At last we were truly entering the white, aeon-dead world of the ultimate south."" 
  
EXAMPLE 2NAW: ""The sunlight reflecting off the ice created some unusual visual effects."" 
  
 HPL:""Distant mountains floated in the sky like enchanted cities, and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold, silver and scarlet land of Dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun."" 
  
EXAMPLE 3NAW: ""The mountain range had an eerie appearance"" 
  
 HPL: “It was as if these stark, nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream, and complex gulfs of remote time, space, and ultra-dimensionality. I could not help feeling that they were evil things—mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss. That seething, half-luminous cloud background held ineffable suggestions of a vague, ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial, and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness, separateness, desolation, and aeon-long death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world.” 
  
 EXAMPLE 4NAW: “The structures were of an extremely odd nature.” 
  
HPL: “There were geometrical forms for which Euclid could scarcely find a name- cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation; terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion; shafts with odd bulbous enlargements; broken columns in curious groups; and five-pointed or five-ridged arrangements of mad grotesqueness.”
  
...What can we learn from the above? My takeaway is that Lovecraft was more than just a freakishly twisted genius creator of the superbly bizarre. He was also the king of melodrama who had literary chops to spare and could create atmosphere out of whole cloth even while describing the most mundane of activities. Put simply, HP Lovecraft was the MAN!!! It is also my opinion that the MAN was at his absolute best in ATMOM. I must admit that I say this with some hesitation because I have had a deep and long lasting love affair with both “The Call of Cthulhu” and “The Dunwich Horror.” However, despite an epic battle between story titans, I think that ATMOM wins a narrow victory because of its length and its detailed and comprehensive discussion of the “Cthulhu Mythos” which I thought was superb. 
  PLOT SUMMARY AND THOUGHTS
ATMOM is the story of a doomed scientific expedition to Antarctica told in the first person by William Dyer, a geologist from Lovecraft’s famous “Miskatonic University.” Dyer explains at the very beginning of the novella that his reason for putting this story to paper is in the hope that that by recounting his extraordinary experiences, he can dissuade any further exploration of the region. He also recognizes the likelihood that the more fantastic elements of his story will not be accepted: 
   Doubt of the real facts, as I must reveal them, is inevitable; yet if I suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible there would be nothing left.
The main expedition group (which does not include our narrator) begins exploration of the surrounding area. They eventually discover 14 specimens of a previously unknown species of life (having both plant and animal qualities) that appear to be close to 50 Million years old. The discovery calls into question all of the current scientific theories regarding the history of life on Earth. Despite their age, 8 of the 14 specimens appear to be in almost pristine condition. One of the group members provides the following description of these Elder Things:
   Six feet end to end, three and five-tenths feet central diameter, tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths–combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans which gives almost a seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things in the Necronomicon.
 When Dyer and the remaining members of the party suddenly lose contact with the expedition, they fly to the camp to investigate and what they find is………I am going to stop there so as not to give away any major spoilers. Let me just say that what Dyer and Danforth (another group member) find at the camp and what they encounter during their subsequent investigations are the stuff of glorious, wonderful and terrifying nightmares as only HP can write them. In addition, a portion of the remaining story is a wonderfully detailed back story of many central aspects of Lovecraft’s universe. It has been said that ATMOM was Lovecraft’s way of re-categorizing the Cthulhu mythology from his earlier stories into something with more of a science fiction flavor. Mythology, fantasy or science fiction, whatever flavor you want to call it, it is scrumptiously DELICIOUS. Finally, ATMOM ties together many of Lovecraft’s earlier stories, including: “The Dunwich Horror, “The Call of Cthulhu,” “The Colour Out of Space,” “Haunter in the Dark,” “The Thing on the Doorstep,” “Pickman’s Model,” and “The Shadow over Innsmouth.” Long time readers of Lovecraft will have fun spotting the references and connections to these stories. To sum up, this is an extraordinary story and is now on my list of “All Time Favorites.” While HPL has written so many wonderful stories that it is hard to call any one his masterpiece. However, if you had to select just one story to embody the greatness of Lovecraft’s work, you could do worse than picking this novella. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! P.S. Here is a bonus quote and accompanying photo that I did not have a good place to include it in the body of the review. Enjoy.
  
“It was the utter, objective embodiment of the fantastic novelist's ""thing that should not be""; and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast, onrushing subway train as one sees it from a station platform - the great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterraneous distance, constellated with strangely coloured lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder.""",192,32
32767,At the Mountains of Madness,J.G. Keely,546,9407,2,"May 20, 2018","I used to defend Lovecraft's reputation, arguing that he'd suffered the same fate as fellow pulp author Howard: that later writers, hoping to profit off of his name, put it on the cover of all sorts of middling short story collections--cliche and badly-written stuff that (if the reader is lucky) might actually contain one or two stories by the original author.However, in this tale, Lovecraft proves that he can write just as badly as his gaggle of followers. It is meant to be a story of the fantastical, of the supernatural, of mystery and suspense--yet it is full of the very things that kill off any sense of wonder or the uncanny. Nothing demysticizes like familiarity, and this book is full of precise descriptions of his monstrous creatures, their histories, their habits--Lovecraft even spends a few paragraphs telling us how they like to furnish and decorate their living rooms. A tip for writers of the supernatural: if you want a being to be mysterious and unsettling, don't go off on a tangent about its commitment to feng shui.In the Annotated Lovecraft, where I most recently read this story, noted critic S.T. Joshi claims that Lovecraft wasn't a pulp author, but something else, something greater--yet this story, one of Lovecraft's most well-known, is rife with all the worst habits of the pulps: pointless details, repetitive descriptions, crutch words, extensive exposition, little change in tone or voice, convenient plotting, and impossibly insightful protagonists. Beyond that, Lovecraft doesn't even deliver on those things that make pulps worth reading in the first place: verve, action, dynamic characters, and tension.The whole story is basically a scientist explaining to the reader a series of carvings that he's looking at. The actual plot--the fact that he and his team of researchers are trapped in Antarctica and think that something is killing them off--is treated as a secondary concern.The thin story is padded out by interminable details, the same comments and observations, repeated over and over, page after page. Like a bad game of Dungeons and Dragons, every new room is needlessly described: they entered a spheroid oblong, 63 yards long and 41 yards wide, the walls were worked stone, covered in carvings depicting some tentacled creature.There are always carvings.As we go along, the protagonist describes it all to us minutely, with a level of insight that grows increasingly laughable. At one point, he mentions that he can somehow tell, by a series of ancient stone-etched pictures left by an alien race, that they had lost the skill of telepathy and switched to spoken communication. In the real world, archaeologists struggle their entire careers to figure out what particular people, places, events, and objects are being represented in surviving remnants of murals, but our plucky narrator doesn't suffer a moment's confusion on how aliens artistically rendered telepathic powers some hundred million years ago.Indeed, the entire expedition seems to have a level of knowledge and familiarity with 'eldritch tomes' and 'esoteric history' that is quite impressive. Keep in mind that these aren't paranormal researchers, but regular geologists, archaeologists, paleontologists, &c.--and yet, every time they enter a new room, they never fail to comment that this or that carving reminds them of something they once read in the Necronomicon. They throw off references to the mi-go and the shaggoth as if discussing nothing so remarkable as varieties of sparrow, and recall in detail historical events of a hundred million years ago with the utmost nonchalance.Apparently, far from being an incomprehensible mystery the mere overhearing of which accursed syllables invokes incurable madness, the History of Cthonic Horrors is in fact a basic undergrad class required at all proper universities (and Marty's favorite topic when he's trying to impress drunk girls at the Young Scientists mixer).Now, perhaps the fact that the narrator never fails to halt his headlong flight from horrid monsters in order to examine and explain the carvings is meant to represent the fellow's meticulous character--which brings up an important writing lesson: once a fact has been established in the text, it does not need to be reiterated ad nauseam. You don't have to mention the character's clothes and sword in every scene, because once those things have been described, the reader isn't going to assume the character is suddenly naked and defenseless just because the scene changed. Having the character demonstrate this trait once or twice in a story is perfectly effective, without wasting a lot of space reiterating.Reading this plodding list of details reminded me of nothing so much as discussing writing with a teenage would-be fantasy author: ask about his book, and he'll spend forty minutes telling you what color swords the southern nation has, how many priest-kings ruled in succession over the Lost Isles, what city-states exported the most grain in the decades since the mana-plague, and the convoluted rules he's put together for how a fire spell works.In short, by the end, he hasn't mentioned anything that resembles a story: no sense of character, psychology, pacing, tone, plotting, structure, theme, climax, pivotal scenes, conflict, tension, style, language, dialogue--never forget that, when it comes to a good story, setting is irrelevant. Get together some costumes and props, build a set, arrange the furniture, get your lighting perfect, and guess what: you still don't have a play.Yet you can perform Shakespeare in a blank room, all the actors dressed in nondescript black, and you'll still get a great story, great characters and emotions and moments. Change the setting to a space station, an elf kingdom, a Wild West boomtown, a port full of pirates, and it doesn't matter--the story is still the thing that carries it.It's frustrating to watch an author just obsess over details, because overall, it's something they do to please themselves, not their audience. It's like a set dresser carefully filling all the drawers on set with realistic, accurate props that will never be used in the play, never seen by the audience. At some point, it's just a self-indulgent game.However, that doesn't mean I don't understand the appeal of this story--indeed, it has consistently been popular, republished over and over throughout the years as a 'Lovecraft classic'. It's chock-full of exposition and explanation, and there are few things that fandom likes more. To have Lovecraft's world, his mysteries, his horrors laid out so simply, so fully, makes them easy to understand, easy to tie together--and easy to obsess over. That collection of little details, of the inner-workings of a fictional world is what much of fandom is built on. It is less a story and more a Star Wars technical guide.A proper mystery, a story of true terror and fantasy doesn't give out simple explanations, because that would undermine the very sense of unease, of the supernatural on which such a story is based. Mystery and explanation are antithetical to one another: once the mystery has been explained, then the mystery has ended.Yet, there are many readers who come away from a fantastical story asking 'what really happened?'--which, of course, is the wrong question, because what really happened was that an author sat down and created a piece of fiction from his imagination. There is no reality outside of the story, the story exists to be a good story, to have feeling, pacing, and structure that works. A story does not actually exist in any concrete world 'out there' to be discovered and enumerated.The error Lovecraft makes here (the same error Mike Mignola made with Hellboy recently) was taking a strange and fantastical world and trying to 'lock it down', to make it into something explicable, predictable, fundamentally known. Some might suggest that this urge opens up that world to other authors, by allowing them to know what 'really happened', but in truth, it closes off the world, it limits fundamentally what that world can be, and what stories can take place within it--not only for other prospective authors, but also for readers.It shrinks the whole thing down and makes it more easily digestible--which is diametrically opposed to the supposed theme of Lovecraft's stories: that there are things, both objects and ideas that are larger than we are, that are too grand for us to ever truly understand, things that cannot be simply encapsulated through a straightforward summary of events. This story, more than any other, is a betrayal of the very thing that is supposed to set Lovecraft's work apart, making it interesting and influential in the first place.Instead, we get something along the lines of 'true tales' of Atlantis and the Hollow Earth that charlatans were peddling at the time, and which have since transformed into shows about 'Ancient Aliens' on the History Channel. Perhaps that's the true legacy of Lovecraft's work: uncredentialed wackos spouting paranoid alien conspiracies--well, that and cute Cthulhu plushies.",176,18

Why were we outside of our fair city, our families and companions mere steps away? The reasons are lost in time. And as we slumbered, our tropical paradise became a land of neverending winter, a polar graveyard. 
  
We were woken, those of us who still lived. Four lived and four were lost. We woke in confusion and terror, our tropic city gone, the snow and wind howling around us. Strange bipedal things cried out and lay their hands upon us, intent on experimentation, their four-legged companions barking and savage... we slew them all in our panic. Odd creatures, these bipedal explorers. Were they the new masters of this world? Were they our peers? We, the Elder Race, have few of those.
  
We took some of their equipment, and a body each of the bipeds and their companions for further study. We buried our dead and then made haste back to our city, to see what changes a million millennia had wrought. After our leave-taking, new explorers arrived. They discovered our city.
  

  
We returned to our home. It had became an empty palace of the dead. Where were our fellows? Where were our servants, the creatures we called Shoggoths?
  
Only our loyal companions remained in this terrible empty city. They squawked their excitement at our return. A million millennia is a long time! But they could tell us nothing of what had become of our world.
  

  
And as we explored our ruins, so the new explorers explored as well. 
  

  
Overcome with despair, we journeyed to a refuge that had been built by our kind, a city constructed within a subterranean sea. We followed our tunnels down. And there we found not our sought-for homecoming... but another necropolis. And so we found our doom. Shoggoths! Traitorous servants! As they had risen up against our kind in ages past, they had rebelled again - but this time they had won. They had destroyed our undersea refuge and all of our kind. And as we gazed upon our shattered city within the dark waters beneath the earth, the Shoggoths rose once more... and slew the last of us. 'Twas indeed a tragic homecoming. We that remained of the Elder Race, lost out of time, born again into a world so strange, and then so quickly slain.The biped explorers had their own meeting with our rebel servants. The meeting did not go well.
  
And yet, unlike us, they managed to escape the Shoggoths, and fled our city. In their flight, did they pass near that fearsome land next to ours, beyond our mountains? Ancient Kadath. A place out of time, home to the Old Ones. Terrible Kadath! We had lived in Kadath's shadow, in the shadow of those old slumbering gods, so long ago. What did the explorers glimpse in their flight near Kadath? Were we not the only beings the explorers had woken?

People love the whole mythos thing, and I don't blame them, because the Lovecraftian mythos is awesome. But I don't particularly enjoy actually reading Lovecraft because his actual stories simply aren't very good. In this novel, for example, the story is basically a framework for him to do some world building. There's no real plot, character development, or dramatic tension. Lovecraft is clearly more concerned with building a history of the Old Ones than he is in telling a good story. I think I might get more enjoyment from reading Lovecraft's wikipedia page than I do from reading any of his stories.

  “On the barren shore, and on the lofty ice barrier in the background, myriads of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their fins”.
Yep! We are in Lovecraft’s universe where even penguins are grotesque. I mean, whoever heard of an ugly penguin? At the Mountains of Madness is H.P. Lovecraft’s best known novel, not that difficult an accomplishment as he did not write that many (only this one and The Case of Charles Dexter Ward I believe. A wise decision because I find that his style is much more suited to the short story format. There are some amazing, creepy and wildly entertaining tales in the “greatest hits” anthology The Best of H.P. Lovecraft Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and the Macabre that I reviewed rambled about in detail.At the Mountains of Madness is basically about an expedition to an unexplored part of Antarctica. The intrepid explorers of course run into weird Lovecraftian things and the protagonist lives to tell the tale as a deterrent to other explorers. The main asset of this book is Lovecraft’s painstaking world building, free from the constraint of the short story format he takes his time describing the setup, the landscape and the increasingly strange discoveries. As a result the novel is steeped in creepy atmosphere you can really immerse into. That said I really don’t think this should be anyone’s gateway into Lovecraft’s fiction. The descriptions can seem a little interminable and the pacing can be something of a slog for the impatient readers, especially if they are not familiar with Lovecraft’s idiosyncratic writing style. The readers who have enjoyed some Lovecraft stories, especially the “The Cthulhu Mythos” one will find much to enjoy here. The infamous Necronomicon by the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred (as opposed his totally sane relatives I guess) is often referred to. The Elder Ones, the Shoggoths and some unnamed things even the monsters are sacred of are featured. As usual with Lovecraft there is no dialogue to speak of and characterization is nonexistent. There is also not a lot of action in this book, the climax is a little vague. All the creepy setup does not result in a spectacular payoff. If you just read it for the creep factor you should be well satisfied.In spite of its popularity this is not my favorite of his works but personally I will always have time for more Lovecraft.(3.5 stars) ",37,19
