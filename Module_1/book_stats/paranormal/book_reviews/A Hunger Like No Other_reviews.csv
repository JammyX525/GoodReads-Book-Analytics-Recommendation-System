14384,A Hunger Like No Other,chucklesthescot,"2,904",118,1,"December 20, 2016","I DESPISE this kind of rape-glorifying bullshit! We have the innocent half vampire girl chased all over town by psycho madman who makes several starts to raping the terrified girl and has her crying and begging, then lo and behold just as he is about to 'do' her she suddenly feels desire for him and off we head to lovey dovey land despite him treating her like shit. This shit sickens me to the bloody stomach and I hate to see this kind of forced sex used as entertainment and wrapped up with pink bows and paraded as romance and seduction. If men on the street behaved like this I somehow doubt that we'd see it as fluffy bunny romance-we'd be screaming blue murder! I know this is fiction and the excuse is his tortured past but it still isn't the slightest bit erotic or romantic to me,just plain sick.***Dec 2016 update...dear dear I was a bit irate when I wrote it but I feel strongly about rape being turned into love and romance. At the time I tended to vent rather than explain. However I am more measured in my reviews now and want to clarify a couple of things:-I am not having a go at anyone who reads and enjoys these books as it is fiction and everyone has the right to enjoy their reading. So if you enjoy this kind of book I'm not trying to say there is something wrong with you! This is just my personal opinion on the plot.-I don't mean this as an attack on the actual author, just the subject matter being used. I'm not trying to say there is something wrong with the author for writing this plot. So there we are. If you like the author and the plot, please continue to do so and just ignore my venting!***",416,9
14384,A Hunger Like No Other,Blacky *Romance Addict*,464,6201,4,"March 25, 2015","*review of audiobook*Well I have really mixed feelings about this book.His fantastic Scottish accent caused this:The way the narrator did the woman's voice made me:The sex made me think:But overall I really did enjoy it. It was a different experience, that's for sure XDThe universe in the seriesIt has them all. Vampires, werewolves, demons, valkyries, shape-shifters, wraiths, witches and probably every paranormal creature ever mentioned somewhere.I kind alike it :)It's more focused on vampires, werewolves and valkyries, and not everything is explained yet, but I'm looking forward to finding out more about everything in the following books :)The storyAfter being imprisoned and tortured for decades, Lachlain finally finds what he needs in order to escape.His mate.Emma is very gentle and fragile, definitely not someone he expected to be his forever, and especially when he finds out she is a vampire, his mortal enemy.He plans his revenge against the people who imprisoned him, and the best way to accomplish that is through Emma...This was a great intro into the series, not too overwhelming with information, and yet everything was explained that needed to be.The beginning was very shocking, well at least to me because I started it without knowing a single fact about this, expect that it had vampires.I actually thought HE was a vampire, so imagine my shock when I found out he wasn't :DDD The ending was a bit eye-rolling, with the bad guy and so on, but oh well, could've been worse so I'm not complaining :)But I want an epilogue or something :(it ended too abruptly for my taste :((((((EmmaShe is shy, innocent, fragile little half vampire/half valkyrie.So being kidnapped and treated roughly by Lachlain is not something she is good at handling.She kinda got on my nerves in the beginning, with being so fragile and all, but as it went on, her personality changed as well and she grew on me :)The big revelation in the end was a huge DUH! and totally not a shock XD LachlainI love him <3 His Scottish accent <3His uber-possessiveness <3I even loved when he was an uber-jerk to her <3He wants revenge against the vampires and figures Emma will be the best way to help him with that. Of course, when he gets to know her better, he realises he has to keep her as his own :D ehehehehehehehI don't want to make this an uber-swoon-fest about him, but basically I loved the hell out of him and everything he did here :)))The sexThis is the part that really, but really surprised me while listening.Maybe it was the combo of the narrator doing freaky voices, for one creeping me out when he did him, and for two making me laugh like crazy when he did her.BUT!The first sex...was during a full moon when the beast took over him and he f*cked her in half-beast form for the entire night.It was a total mood-killer for me, I didn't enjoy it at all :(It actually made me drop a star because gah, I just hated it :DMaybe because this is such a normal PNR, I just didn't expect it, but I'm thinking in situations like these it goes to the category of MONSTER-SEX!!!!!!!Oh well.Overall3,5-4 stars for this one.It kept my attention throughout the audio, I didn't want to stop listening even though it was funny at places it wasn't supposed to be, I didn't find it hot where I was supposed to, but the fact that I enjoyed the whole audio even with all of the things that bothered me says something.I honestly have no idea how I would've liked this if I've read it.For one, I could'be get his perfect Scottish accent <3<3<3The shock value was huge because of listening to it.But then the sex probably wouldn't be so creepy if not for the voices he did for the guy.And I wouldn't laugh like a lunatic at everything the woman said.Well, whatever :DI just know I'm DEFINITELY continuing with the series and keeping my fingers crossed there won't be anymore monster-sex scenes XDXDXDXDXDPS: And for all monster-sex lovers, give this a try ehehehehhehhehehheheh[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",166,107
14384,A Hunger Like No Other,Emily May,"1,921",29000,2,"July 7, 2011","2.5 Stars simply for the inexplicable need the novel induced in me to keep on reading despite the many reasons not to. I actually find it quite surprising that I didn't abandon the book after the first few chapters featured numerous attempted rape scenes, a control freak of a man (or male, at least) whose violent tendencies are not only portrayed as acceptable, but highly desirable. But, though I was immediately horrified, the book also somehow managed to hold my attention and the writing style, a strange interest in the plot, and a morbid fascination in this destructive relationship forced me to read on.I'm not at all in favour of this kind of unhealthy relationship where the guy relentlessly pursues a woman, scares her into submission, and attempts to rape her so many times that she eventually decides he's kinda hot. I do not find this an appealing romance story. If it was a cautionary tale of abusive relationships... well, then sure! But Kresley Cole seems to celebrate the controlling personality of Lachlain and I find it rather disturbing to see how highly rated this book is. Apparently, he's so ""gorgeous"" and ""sexy"" and ""protective"" and these traits all make up for the fact that he repeatedly sexually assaults Emma, refuses to let her return to her family, demands that she sleep in the same bed as him (to her obvious discomfort as her kind are known for preferring to sleep on the floor), and even picks out the clothes she wears. He picks out the clothes she wears. This is not a romance, it's the story of one person completely taking over the life of another, refusing to let them make any decisions for themselves and calling it love.Can someone actually let me know why so many rate this book highly? It's not much of an urban fantasy because there's just a random array of creatures that hate each other and no great mythological story going on... and it certainly doesn't work as a romance. Or do I not understand the idea of romance and love? Yeah, I'm 19, perhaps it's me who doesn't get it... but I thought it was about caring, compassion and mutual respect. I honestly want to understand why I read this book and saw abuse when thousands have read this and seen love and sexiness.And yes, there were some attempts to redeem Lachlain... he began to understand that he had treated Emma badly and felt very guilty that he had nearly strangled her to death... aww, poor Lachlain... *rolls eyes* Whatever happened later, I never supported their violent relationship; plus, even though Lachlain experienced some minor guilt for the attempted rapes/choking, it didn't affect him enough to let Emma make any decisions for herself... nope, she must stay with him and she must sleep with him, but this time she must like it too! Good god. It was painful to read.Why not 1 star? There were good bits amongst the annoying. I quite liked the scenes where they just talked in the car and he began to learn about the 21st century after being locked up for a couple hundred years; his reaction to the plastic card that has unlimited possibilities was funny, so was his repetitive opening and closing of the sun roof. But there was more of what I don't want to read than what I do want to. I can't and won't wrap my head around the idea of a guy finding his one true mate and treating her in such a cruel, violent and often openly humiliating way. There were times when he obviously enjoyed her discomfort and it infuriated me. For me, love isn't about being selfish and controlling; and for that reason, I won't be reading any more of this series.",160,16
14384,A Hunger Like No Other,Stacia (the 2010 club),"1,045",3934,4,"November 13, 2015","***Re-read 10/7/15. Rating bump from 3 to 4 stars. Original review below. *** ...meanwhile, inside of the Fetish Cafe...Waitress : Miss? Are you ready to order?Me : (clearing throat) Um, I think so? Can you tell me first if there are any off-the-menu specials tonight?Waitress : Nothing extra tonight. Our supplier didn't deliver today, so we're running low on supplies. If you're looking for a fantasy involving props, chances are, it's not going to happen.Me : It's fine. That's not really my thing. (pause) Uh...I think I'll take the kidnapping special. With an order of dominant male. Preferably tall, dark, handsome, and pushy...you know the drill. The alpha type.Waitress : Big spender, aren't we? Anything else? (says sarcastically) Would you like fries with your order?Me : Yes, please. Can I get some gravy with that on the side? Brown, not white.Waitress : (appearing a bit confused) Whatever. It's your fetish.Me : Oh no. The fries aren't part of it. I'm just hungry......Trigger warning : content borders on rapey (yes, it's a word, dammit)Eh, what can I say? A Hunger was a fun and fluffy read. There's no real substance here, but when comparing this to other pnr, it's on par with others that I've liked. Which is not bad, considering I've been on a serious adult pnr break lately after trying a few I didn't like. They're all starting to read the same and I've passed on most of the ones which haven't had more of an urban fantasy bent. Straight-up adult romance novels (in most every genre) have been pretty disappointing to me lately, so I've chosen not to go there. Until now. I saw a few friends talking about this one and figured I'd give it a shot. I find it funny that if this book were realistic fiction, I would rip it up one side and down the other for having such a horrible male lead. As in : NO ONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. The male lead is pushy, demanding, forceful, and about 20 other things which would have any female running for the hills in absolute horror. If some guy (or girl) pulled this act on me or anyone I know, I'd call the cops and have him (or her) locked up. But of course, I tend to cave a little for fantasy based books. What can I say? I have a thing for alpha men in pnr and historicals. Plus, this one had an ancient scottish brogue! Well, hellooooo highlander. Thank you for showing up in my kidnap story.At least, in this book, I get to give the double argument for his lack of decorum. 1. It's pnr. These aren't guys raised in polite society. They're driven by instinct that overwhelms them. Bad excuse? Sure. But hey, it's the basis for most pnr shifter stories. The devil made them do it, or some other nonsense. We laugh at it, we find it far-fetched, we'd hate it if any man in real life treated us like this, but darnit...it's fun to read about in books.2. The dude is old. Like pre-dating historical bodice-ripping, non-con storylines, OLD. As in, ""he came from the dirt"" old. Historical fiction readers know that men from the past weren't as clued in to the equality of men and women. They always seem to need a woman to school them. And our heroine in this story did, in fact, school her man.Who I'd recommend this book to :People who don't mind aggressive alphas in their pnr and can forgive some serious bad behavior if the hero shows some sign of remorse or willingness to change later.Who I'd warn away from the book :Anyone who has a previous history of abuse, whether physical or sexual. The hero(?) did push the boundaries of sex and crossed some lines that he shouldn't have. The book danced that line of danger a little too close for comfort at times going down on someone in their sleep because you want to make them feel good is still against a person's will (and therefore wrong), even if it's not violent or scarring (in this instance) sexual experience....or making them take a shower with you, etc. It's still not okay.Anyone who rolls their eyes at old stereotypes of cavemen-type males. I'm warning you - you will hate this book. It's okay to steer clear. In fact, why are you even reading this review? You might want to go shower all of the gunk off now. Hurry! No, really. I don't blame anyone who would find this book distasteful. Only us fluff cravers are going to enjoy A Hunger. And enjoy, I did. ",133,37
14384,A Hunger Like No Other, Danielle The Book Huntress *Pluto is a Planet!*,"2,591",6154,5,"September 12, 2020","Third Reread Completed in September 2020.I listened to this on Audio, and I think I finished in a few days. That's just how fantastic this book is. This book helped get me into paranormal romance, and I haven't looked back since. The narrator, Robert Petkoff's work is a thing of beauty. His Scottish accent is flawless. His Eastern European accents are excellent. I found his accent for Emmaline interesting, almost like an 19th Century, highly educated Southern accent. That makes sense, she is chronologically 70 (although appears to be in her early twenties). Although books are a lot edgier now than they used to be, this still feels edgy and new/exciting/distinctive to me, and this book is 14 years old. Super hot and steamy and wow. Obsessive hero, check. I had forgotten how borderline mean Lachlan was to Emmaline at first. I'm so glad Emmaline came into herself and learned to stand up for herself against an aggressive mate and overbearing and aggressive family members. I could definitely see myself in her (minus the aggressive mate). Kresley Cole really hit it out of the park with this series and this first full book in the series. It stands up just as well almost 20 years later. I will definitely be rereading the other books. I'm glad that I have fallen back into the Paranormal Romance Zone. It's helping me right now with escapism and helping to rekindle my book reading love. If you haven't read the Immortals After Dark series, what are you waiting for??? *********2nd Reread Completed 8/1-8/9/13Looking back at how much I loved this book when I first read it, and how much I loved it on reread, I can say most definitely that this book is an all-time keeper. For me, this story is magic. I didn't have a lot of time to read it, but I actually didn't want to put it down when I couldn't read it. Finally, when I was able to dedicate some time to reading, I more or less read it straight through, except for when I was busy with my review books and Vacation Bible School. At the end of the night, I was excited to get into bed and curl up and revisit Lachlain and Emma's love story, reading late into the night.LachlainLachlain remains one of my fall time favorite paranormal heroes (and probably of all time). Although I refuse to pick a favorite Immortals After Dark hero, Lachlain makes some steep competition for the following heroes. He starts out a bully, but I can understand why. He literally was insane after being tortured for 150 years. However, it is a testament to his force of will that he didn't do worse to Emmaline, not to mention the power of their bond. Even though he wasn't super nice initially, his charisma was undeniable. As time passes and he realizes who Emma is and how she means to him, above and beyond being his fated mate, he shows just how adoring and capable of caring for his mate he can be. By the time Emma starts to love him, you can understand why. Cole makes you want a Lykae mate of your very own. EmmalineSometimes the heroine doesn't click with me in a romance. But this is not one of those times. I loved Emma. I appreciated her journey of self-identity and coming into her own. She had that awkward feel of a woman on the cusp of maturity in her early twenties. Away from home for the first time, exploring who she is, and finding love. Considering the force of nature that Lachlain is, I think Emma held her own against him, and eventually, she had him eating out of her hand.I think Kresley Cole writes the best steamy romance out there. Blazingly hot, but not crossing the line into raunchy and distasteful (overshare) language that turns 'sexy' into 'gross' for this reader. Even on the reread, I was excited to see what happened next, and fanning myself with the incredible tension and fire between Emma and Lachlain. I wasn't a huge fan of vampire romance prior to reading this (this being one of the first I read at the time), but the scenes in which Lachlain feeds Emma show how powerful that is between a mated pair, and it's sexy, and not gross like I always thought it would be. I'm not saying I want to take blood or give my blood like in the book, but it's written well and beliveable in the context of the story. It's a very intimate thing, and you could see how it furthers the connection between them.On top of the fantastic romance, the world-building is complex and fascinating, and I love the camaraderie between the Valkyries and the other characters. You can see the Lore factions aligning before your eyes on the one way march to the Ascension. And though the developing romance is fascinating, it's also great to get glimpses into the past of the long-lived creatures of the Lore. There's a reason why Kresley Cole is in my top five authors of all time. She knows how to bring it. In the paranormal and historical romance genres, she kicks butt and takes names. You want to keep coming back for more of this wonderful world she has created. I'm glad I was able to revisit this fantastic book and I am jazzed to continue my 2013 reread of the Immortals After Dark series.Check out my Immortals After Dark Pinboard on Pinterest.****Original Review Below*********I bought this book because I had read ""If You Dare,"" by this author and absolutely loved it. Well, lets just say, it made a steadfast fan of me. The Immortals After Dark is one of my all time favorite paranormal series, and part of the reason I'm so crazy about paranormals. Lachlain is kind of crazy, and who can blame him after being imprisioned horribly underground in a fiery pit, being drowned every day and consumed by fire for 150 years. One day he senses his mate, and he does something really painful and desperate to get free, to get to her. I was hooked. Lachlain is what I call a Sexy, Scottish, Werewolf. What a great combination. His one shortcoming is that he is kind of snobby towards Emmaline at first. He's dismayed that this true mate (Lykae only get one) is a Vampire. Although she's really a halfling, half-vampire, half-valkyrie. Emmaline is as timid as you can get. She's been protected and coddled by her valkyrie aunts her whole young life. She's about 70 years old, which is very young for a vampire and a valkyrie. Despite her penchant for very sexy, expensive lingerie, she's an innocent virgin. Imagine this crazed, beastly man tearing across a Paris courtyard, and dragging you off with him, and wanting to do things with you of a sexual nature? Very scary thought. This is how this book begins. Cole grabbed me as a reader and didn't let go. I wanted to find out how Lachlain would deal with the fact that his mate was not exactly what he wanted. Would he force her? Would she grow to love him and trust him? They go on a journey to get back to Lachlain's ancestral holdings in Scotland. He is the king of the Lycae and must go back to take his place as ruler of his people. Even though he isn't really happy with the mate that was chosen for him by fate, he's taking her with him. Lochlain has to get used to modern life. He finds he has expensive tastes, and charges up poor Emmaline's platinum card. He really makes the poor girl miserable. But she does manage to fall in love with him. She's not so sure about this Queen of the Lykae deal and having such a dominant mate, though. So it takes some serious wooing, Lykae-style, on Lachlain's part. And Lachlain discovers that having a vampire bride is a great thing, because being bitten by her is ecstasy. Plus, Emmaline is a sweet, loving woman who eases her way into his heart. This was a fabulous book. I was already werewolf-inclined after reading the MaryJanice Davidson story ""Love's Prisoner"", Bitten by Kelley Armstrong, and Night Play by Sherrilyn Kenyon, so it really got my attention. This is a spicy read with very hot love scenes, that don't overshadow the growing love between Lachlain and Emmaline. I enjoyed the whole dynamic of reluctant mates, and the crazy, alpha werewolf hero really appealed to me. I loved how Lachlain's feelings towards his bride changed so that he came to adore her and appreciate her. She became his life. I also loved how timid Emmaline comes into her own. She was drifting because she knew neither of her parents. She was afraid and disliked her vampire nature, and had to come to terms with who she is. She becomes quite the warrior queen. Ah, this is a classic for me. It comes highly recommended. Just a warning to readers. The first book in this series is the story in Playing Easy to Get, ""The Warlord Wants Forever."" I read this one first and I was scratching my head trying to figure out who Nikolai and Myst were. You can read this first, but you might be a little lost when they bring up Nikolai and Myst as a forgone conclusion.",115,57
14384,A Hunger Like No Other,Jessica's Totally Over The Top Book Obsession,"1,149",3128,5,"March 9, 2017","This book had a slow start, but finished with a bang!spoilers
  
 Lachlain was crazy out of his mind from years and years of being burned alive and tortured by a vampire horde so for about 1/4 of the book he was a asshat... but as his mind starts to heal and he starts to get to know Emma he feels guilt over the way he has treated her and starts trying to win her love and trust. Emma is super shy, timid, and lets people walk all over her. She was raised in a house that hates vampires and being 1/2 vampire it made her feel like a outsider and that she could one day turn evil. 
  

  
She starts feeding from Lachlain and she starts coming out of her shell and because a stronger woman she learns to fight for herself and those she loves. It is nice to see the growth of emma from fearful to kickass. Someone who will be walked on no longer Some of my fav quotes 
  
“Was it just her, or did lovers look more adoringly at each other in this city? Especially in the springtime.'Die, bastards.'She sighed. It wasn't their fault that they were bastards who should die.”""I followed you. Emma, I'll always come for you.""""Are you jealous, lass?""""Yes!"" she cried, as if she couldn't believe the question.

  “When he watched her sleeping, he often thought, My heart lies vulnerable outside my chest.” 
I've purchased this book again because of the stunning cover. I read A Hunger Like No Other first time two years ago. I was in awe then for the start that the hero, Lachlain, is chasing after the heroine with fury in his heart. Emma is very innocent, all her life she tries to find her lost father and she gets nothing from her search; however, she hardly wants to give up. Furthermore, Lachlain makes life a living hell of her, Emma haven't known what he wants even though the passion between is slowly building up, he confines her and has no plan to let her go.
  “Emma turned to him, bottom lip trembling. “For me?” “Always for you. All things for you. He coughed into his fist “All your own.”
 I haven't known before that this book is good as this. The Beauty and the beast plot works so well with the dark tone of the story. While Emma is definitely Belle, I dare not say that Lachlain is the Beast for his actions that aren't heroic or highly appreciated at all. He tortures her, even when I saw her consent to his deeds, he still treats her as if she is at his disposal.But Kresley Cole could redeem her book with the second half it. The developments of both Emma and Lachlain are visible there. Emma is so shy when I started reading this book, but in the end, she is brave and kickass and independent. Lachlain, too, he tries to be a better person and makes amends for what he's done. He has made mistakes and he wants to right it, that's exactly what he should do.
  “Nix had told Emma before she'd left for Europe that on this trip she would 'do that which you were born to do.' Apparently, Emma was born to get kidnapped by a deranged Lykae. Her fate sucked.” 
 By the way, I loved this book because it's my very first experience for reading romance. It introduced me to the new world that I want to stay forever.https://goo.gl/a48Gam",65,12
14384,A Hunger Like No Other,Sophia Triad,"2,239",3426,5,"May 14, 2017","Lachlain MacRieve(Lykae) & Emmaline Troy (half Valkyrie/half vampire)""Vampires, Valkirie, and Lykae, oh my. The 'fucking monster mash'""Lachlain has just discovered his mate in Paris and he is not sure if he wants her. You see, his mate is a filthy vampire. She is one of the revolting creatures that Lachlain has spent all his immortal life chasing and brutally killing without remorse. She is one of the malicious creatures that had him imprisoned and tortured with fire for centuries. So, this is definitely a mistake. Fate cannot be that cruel. He cannot be the protector of someone so vile.Emmaline is having a nice, relaxing time in Paris, while she is looking for her father who abandoned her mother before she was born. That night she is sitting on the bench thinking that her trip was in vain and smelling the Paris air, when a brute madman suddenly appears and he starts approaching her. Half-lit by the walk’s torchlights, a towering man turned over café tables, artists’ easels, and book stands selling century-old pornography. Tourists screamed and fled in the wake of destruction.Of course Emma runs! And of course it is not really clever to run away from a wolf.He pointed a shaking hand at her. “You,” he growled.The setting is magnificent. It felt like Lachlain and Emma are part of a motion picture, something close to the “An American Werewolf in Paris” :)Overall I enjoyed the story, although there were times that I was feeling frustrated with all the misunderstandings:-Emma does not tell Lachlain that she is not exactly a bloodthirsty, sexthirsty vampire. But that she half Valkyrie/half Vampire. And a virgin.- Lachlain does not tell her that she is his destined mate and he treats her like garbage because she is the enemy.As a result there are two distinct parts in the book. The first part in which there are secrets between the two lovers. The second part where they both learn the truth, Lachlain deliciously grovels and Emma embraces her true destiny.I loved the introduction of the Lykae and their castle in the Highlands over the grounds of Kinevane and I loved the Valkyrie family united looking out for each other.",57,21

    ""Vampires, Valkyrie, and Lykae, oh my. Or as Regin calls it—the ‘fucking monster mash.’ Hilarity ensued.""
  
I found myself in deep water: first I was confused by the many different creatures, their characterization and history. The story is fast-paced, and Kresley Cole’s wicked humor made me devoted to the series. So far, it was the most comical father-murder I’ve ever read. I was especially delighted at the appearance of Nïx, my most favorite character ever.I really love this unique and complex world that Cole created. How she keeps the multiple story lines in hand is really fascinating.Lachlain and Emma are bonded together by blood, fate and instincts.Lachlain is infuriated by the fact that Emma is partly a vampire, but as the story progresses, he suddenly catches himself forgetting about it.
""He would use this against her, he thought hazily. If his blood on her tongue made her lose control like this, he would force her to drink him until she surrendered everything...Force a vampire to drink him…what was happening to him?""
Lachlain’s desire for Emma is so strong that it helps him to stay sane after being tortured for 150 years. He is possessive and arrogant, but sometimes has really tender moments:
  When he watched her sleeping, he often thought, My heart lies vulnerable outside my chest.
Emma is a very young immortal. She is only seventy, overprotected by her Valkyrie aunts, delicate, shy and insecure. But she has hidden assets.There is a beast not only in Lachlain, but in Emma as well. Her real strength breaks surface by drinking from Lachlain. His blood, memories, instincts are catalysts for her alteration.The gentle, fearful Emma becomes a strong, confident, wily warrior.KinevaneVal Hall - Special thanks to Stacia Villota for the picture.
  My favorite quotes.

  When he watched her sleeping, he often thought, My heart lies vulnerable outside my chest. 
Lachlain MacRieveLachlain is the King of the Lykae (werewolves) and has spent the last one hundred and fifty years chained under the streets of Paris by an open fire. He burns to death daily, only to regenerate and suffer that cruel death over and over again. His torture at the hands of the vampire horde has no end in site until he smells his mate. But Lachlain has gone insane and his only desire is to exact revenge on every living vampire.Lachlain goes berserk when he discovers that his mate is a Vampire! How could fate be so cruel to make his one and only mate his mortal enemy? So what if she is weak, frail, small, and docile.Emmaline TroyEmma's mother was a Valkyrie and her father was a Vampire. She has been raised by her crazy ass Valkyrie aunts, who are mortal enemies of Vampires. With her genes, Emma should be fierce and strong, but she is afraid of her own shadow. Her motto is to keep her head down, avoid conflict, and if that fails, …RUN!!! In a brief moment of bravery, she travels to Paris alone hoping to discover the identity of her vampire father. But Emmaline finds more than just the identity of her father, she finds her mate. And he isn't a nerdy, quiet, gentleman. He's a pissed off Lykae, insane from torture and wild with need of his woman. He's coming for her in full rage and it's a frightening sight!! Emma's instinct is to RUN
  “Never run from one such as me, female. You will no’ get away - and we like it.”
This was a wonderful story of growth. Emma had grown up coddled, protected, and ashamed of being part vampire. She was literally afraid of her own shadow, and never spoke up for herself. I am usually not a fan of omega types, but I could relate to Emma for some reason. She was a product of her environment, and it took her leaving that cage, to finally become the fierce warrior she was capable of all along. And I loved it!!Val HallLachlain may be a badass werewolf, but his sole purpose was making Emma happy. At lease it is after he gets over her whole vampireism…LOL He hated her for the first half of the book, even though he wanted to bone her brains out. Oh, the angst!! Plus, I'm a sucker for a tortured hero. His attempts at seduction had me panting and ready, but Emma was not as easy as I am. Needless to say, I was BEYOND ready for these two to ""seal the deal"" by the time it happened.
  “Now, undress for me and let me see what’s mine.” 
I am loving this series so far and can't wait to read the next installment.

14384,A Hunger Like No Other,LMM,179,51,1,"March 17, 2009","Wow I thought this was pretty bad. I know I am in the minority but I found the plot was really thin. I also felt all the characters were incredibly ""thick""(except Bove) esp. Emma & her family. IMO, There are far better paranormal ""romance"" books. I just didn't connect w/the characters at all nor the author's justifications for their actions.Basically the book followed the Romance formula authors are forced to follow by their publishers to a T:Sexually experienced to the hilt, hung like a horse Alpha Male meets his true Virginal mate (or vice versa - apparently, these men are just as surprised at I am they these woman are still virgins. One of them is reluctant & fights the attraction by usually believing something not true about the person, about 50% through the book is when something sexual happens - so they either have sex for the 1st time OR something big sexually happens but they don't have sex.If they don't have sex @ the 50% mark - more misunderstanding high-jinks ensue until about 70-79% When the deed is actually done.At 80% the big bad starts to be dealt with. By 90% is being confronted & by 95-100% the author ties up the happy ending. In this book - The main character is an insecure, whiny, spoiled, cruel, shrew. The man is very Alpha & grunts his speech 1/2 the time but he is a hell of a lot better than her & her insane family. The plot is lame & the the formula is dog tired.The worst part is that actually, the man from the beginning tries to find out more about the MC & explain himself but she won't hear it. The author's excuse? ""She's secretive"" & ""she wants to protect her family."" From what I don't know b'c they happen to be lethal - it's just all a series of excessively dumb assumptions.I suppose I would say this is really technically ""paranormal romance"" & that's that.I don't recommend unless the person is a hardcore romance junkie.",48,3

14384,A Hunger Like No Other,✩ Yaz ✩,471,1095,4,"January 6, 2023","4 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️His voice gravelly, he answered, “I think you’re the most beautiful creature I’ve ever seen.”Delighted to say that the Immortals After Dark series seems to be very promising and where was Kresley Cole and why did I only discover her books recently?! Although this novel was published in 2006 but it still holds up very well in our modern time.A Hunger Like No Other is the first sizzling full-length standalone novel in the series following a turbulent and seductive forbidden romance between two strangers whose people are sworn enemies and are drawn to each other by their dark desires—as they are fated mates.Note: each standalone follow a different couple but are connected with an overarching plot. There is a novella prior the first novel.What to expect of this book?— Dark Paranormal Romnace— Enemies-to-Lovers— Forbidden Romance— Fated Mates— Vampire x Werewolf (Lykae)— Slowburn and Steamy— Possessive Scottish Alpha Hero— Relatable Heroine— Forced Proximity— Urban Setting— Intriguing Lore— Supernatural CreaturesLachlain MacRieve, head of the Lykae clan (the werewolves), was captured and tortured by the Vampires and their leader for 150 years. Lachlain miraculously escaped but with his sanity hanging by a very thin thread. It wasn't his trauma that engulfed him with madness, but realizing that his long-awaited mate, the woman made for him and who he searched for without cease for a thousand years, was nearby.The Instinct screamed inside him to touch her, to claim her. He’d waited for so long. . . .Emmaline Troy is a 71-year-old immortal and a halfling as she is the product of a Vampire and a Valkyrie. She belongs to coven with her fiercely protective Valkyrie aunts. Although her Valkyrie aunts loved her, loneliness is a sharp blade that jabs at Emma's heart every single day. She longs to find an identity and to find a connection for something that feels like her. She is distraught that her Vampire side could turn into a mindless killer like them.Emma embarks on a quest to Paris to uncover information about her deceased parents and her unknown father. She fails on her quest but the devastation was amplified by being taken away by a mad Lykae to his ancestral Scottish castle.“Kiss me like you want to live.”Kresley Cole constructed such a compelling supernatural world which she calls Lore. The world of Lore is the supernatural fabric in a mortal world where different creatures with powers and magic live among humans and this includes: Valkyrie, vampire, Lykae, ghouls, witches, wraiths, demons, shifters, fairies, and sirens.The story is fast-paced and the writing style is quite immersive and even though it's cosndieted an old school paranormal romance but I would daresay it's still on par with the modern paranormal romances.Lachlain and Emma's beginning is quite rocky and his posessive alpha behavior is not attractive at times because of how it seems he forced himself on Emma. It's not excused or covered up but I think it makes sense within context because these are supernatural creatures whose feelings and sexual appetite is amplified once they find their one true mate, plus Lachlain was descending into madness after being held prisoner and tortured for 150 years. So I have to point out that there is dubious consent and the hero forced himself on the heroine at the beginning a couple of times (but it didn't exceed beyond touching and kisses).The romance I would say is slowburn with steamy scenes given as a treat to the reader every now and then. Lachlain yearns to claim his mate despite her status as a Vampire, marking her as a sworn enemy, but Emma is not so easily deterred by her desires and what she truly wishes to find when it comes to love. A maddened werewolf in the body of a man conjured by her wildest fantasies was not on her agenda, especially one so ill-mannered.But the romance eventually blossoms beautifully and there are many romantic, steamy and tender moments that won me over. I wouldn't say they joined my list of favorite couples, especially not with how unbalanced their dynamic was at the beginning, but the author was able to redeem it.And dear reader, bid farewell to your feminism because it will evaporate temporarily.Emma was a special heroine to me because I found her relatable in so many ways. I love reading about heroines who are struggle with their identity and go on a journey to find themselves. Emma can come off as timid and sheltered but she is also passionate and kind. I love that she was afraid of Lachlain at the start but was never afraid to say ""no"" to him and draw her own boundaries. She was vocal about whenever Lachlain tried to make decisions for her and continue to challenge him. I think the author did a splendid job with her arc.I think the conflict and the resolution was a tad underwhelming but everything else made up for it.I'm eager to continue the series and explore more of the world of Lore and this could turn into a comfort series for me. Trigger Warnings: blood, violence, dubious consent, sexual assault, death.",40,N/A
