38568,A Quick Bite,Sasa,212,117,1,"May 26, 2022","PROS: - A few solid ideas (like the anemia thing in the beginning).- Great opening.CONS: - Writing that gave me second-hand embarrassment.- Hasn't been proofread/edited enough; too many errors.- Terrible foreshadowing; Chekhov's gun much?- Thesaurus abuse and neglect.- Little ""showing"" and too much ""telling"".- Bland story.- Poor character development and the man is an airhead.- Too many useless minor characters.- Absolute trash (which some people might like).- Obvious villain.- No chemistry.- Misogynistic, sexist, and objectifying.- Bad dialogue.COMMENTS: Let me preface this by saying that I love trashy smut so I am in no way a prude. I can see the appeal of trashy romance novels—you just want to be thrown into unrealistic worlds sometimes. However, poorly and irresponsibly written smut never sits right with me.I normally finish books but I put myself through too much halfway through and received a migraine because of this book. This rarely happens and it would have happened with Twilight. At least that book was so bad, it was laugh-inducing. This book was just plain bad. I expected a lot out of it because of all the high ratings it was given. Even so, who wouldn't be interested in a vampire book where the vampire suffers from a fear of blood? I was excited when I started but became disappointed after the page 13 when the cousins were introduced. It felt like Sands was trying give them unique personalities but it didn't take.What I meant by ""showing vs telling"" was that I want to be shown what the characters look like with details versus just telling the audience that they're attractive. The only character that was ""shown"" was Lissianna and her mother. The description was very vivid—to the point of being male gaze-y. The women in the book were described to be ""overdeveloped"" and there were so many things wrong with this book that played on double standards. For example, it hinted how women should be dependent on men but not too dependent or else they'll look desperate??? There was also no chemistry between Greg and Lissianna after their first meeting and Greg was objectifying her every chance he got. He was kidnapped by strangers and, instead of worrying about his life after being physically restrained and tied up, he fantasized about kinky shit. Not only that, but for one horrifying moment, he thought he was r*ped by Lissianna after he'd blacked out and. Instead of worrying about being taken advantage of, he thought he'd taken Lissianna's virginity??? This scene played into the whole ""men can't be r*ped"" bullshit and that's simply not true. There was nothing here for me to root for these two.This book had so many useless characters that felt like they were there just to fill in some pages; it wasn't even to move the story along. Chapter 5 was especially painful to read. Each of the eight cousins went into Greg's room to ask that he not be mad at Lissianna for holding him hostage and each begged him to cure her phobia...ONE. BY. ONE. None of them explained what the phobia was until Lissianna visited him last...I'm going to scREAM!!!!! Even then, after about a hundred pages in, Greg was still unable to guess the glaringly obvious fact that Lissianna and her family were vampires! Even when they spoke about feeding, mind reading, and Greg being dinner 
  IN FRONT OF HIM
!!! Lissianna even bit him during their encounter prior to the conversation (which was actually very well written so it was a nice break from the shitty prose) and what did he think? He thought it would leave a nice little hickey!!!There were a lot of attempts at humor, poor foreshadowing—it just felt like it was trying to do too much while achieving very little. It didn't feel like the book was proofread at all; none of the writing was refined. There were errors in every chapter as well as incomplete sentences. There were times when she abused the thesaurus and times when her thesaurus collected dust like quit with the ""mental kicks"" and ""grimacing"" and use different words or don't use it at all!Great marketing device (cover, synopsis, etc) but the book was a huge disappointment. I think Sands was just writing it as she went along and had no idea how the story would develop. She slapped together a weak trashy book full of cliches. Maybe it'll be fun for some, but it was an outdated and boring read for me. That'll teach me not to take trashy paranormal romances seriously.",121,22
38568,A Quick Bite,Jessica's Totally Over The Top Book Obsession,"1,149",3128,3,"May 8, 2017","This was a pretty good read for the first book in the series. A little slow, I started to get a little bored a few times but over all enjoyable. ",116,14
38568,A Quick Bite,Dina,"1,324",1171,2,"November 26, 2010","This story is marketed as being funny, light and cute. I prefer my PNR books to be on the dark and dangerous side, but I needed to read a ""Q"" book to finish the RRRC's A-Z Book Challenge and A Quick Bite was the only one I had on my TBR - for years, I might add - so I decided to finally give it a chance.Lissianna Argeneau is a 202-year-old vampire who happens to be, gasp!, hemaphobic. That's not a good thing considering what she is. Concerned about her future, her mother Marguerite decides to give Lissi ""the best birthday gift ever"": Dr. Greg Hewitt, a 35-year-old psychologist who specializes in phobias. Marguerite is sure he'll be able to cure Lissi's phobia so she can leave a ""normal"" vampire life.From the awkward moment they meet, Greg and Lissi feel attracted to each other, but nothing good can come out of it because (1) she's a vampire, (2) he's a mere mortal and (3) he'll have his memory erased as soon as he cures her phobia. Naturally, nothing goes according to Marguerite's plan, and Greg and Lissi find themselves running for their lives. But who's after them? Her wacky family? An unsuspected vampire hunter?That wasn't a bad setup, but I'm afraid Ms. Sands didn't make it work for me. I didn't laugh at any of the attempted jokes, I hated Lissi's silly cousins (to the point that I lost track of who was who), I didn't care for the numerous one-dimensional secondary characters and I didn't feel any sexual chemistry between Greg and Lissi. They were both nice enough - well, they weren't annoying - but I didn't feel any love between them. They had a strong connection, I grant you that, but it only veered into the friendship zone - at least, that's how I felt.Simply put, there was no character development in this book. Lissi was unbelievably imature for her age. I don't care if she was considered extremely young in vampire years. Come on, she was 202 years old! She should have been way wiser than she was. I just don't get it. Unless... Do vampire brains develop at a slower rate than mere mortals'? Does vampire blood affect their learning curve so bad that 200-year-old vampires act and talk like teenagers? *groans*Greg was another ""problem"", as I couldn't understand his actions. He was kidnapped, tied up and left without food or water for hours, and took it all in stride. Sure, he had a hissy fit at first, but then calmed down and became the most complacent kidnapped victim of all times. Puh-lease! And when he found out that those deranged people who had kidnapped him were vampires, did he freak out? Of course not! He simply sat down with Lissi - actually, he was tied up to the bed, but at that point, he couldn't care less - and listened attentively while she recited History of the Vampires: Origin & Evolution. Gah!To be fair, I thought the explanation for the origin of the vampires devised by Ms. Sands was unexpected and interesting, but I didn't like the way she explored that concept. When all was said and done, I got the feeling that the Argeneau vampires were just like any regular mortal human with a few enhanced characteristics to make them different. For a PNR, this book was the most un-PNR I've ever read.So, as you might have guessed by now, I didn't like this book. It had some good parts - mainly when Greg and Lissi were on their own and away from her wacky family - but those few and far in between moments weren't enough to make up for everything else. Overall, this was a very disappointing read to me.",46,19
38568,A Quick Bite,Exina,"1,182",369,3,"January 2, 2020","Lissianna Argeneau has hemaphobia, she faints at the sight of blood. It’s not the worst of phobias, you’d think, but Lissi is a vampire, so this phobia makes her life extremely difficult. Vampires don’t feed the old-fashioned way anymore, they use bagged blood. But Lissi can’t stand the sight of it, so she has to ‘feed off the hoof’. She hates the hunt, let alone the dangers of it. It’s not easy to find someone healthy to feed off, someone who is not on drugs or alcohol. So when Lissianna finds a hot man tied to her bed, she thinks he’s her birthday present from her mother. Except, Dr. Gregory Hewitt is here to cure her phobia, not to be a dessert. But when someone is that delicious and tempting like Greg, it is impossible to resist taking a quick bite. I used to read a lot of PNR, and I probably would have liked it more years ago. Though the origin of the vampires is very interesting and unique, I expected more from the story: more humor, more steam, more action, and a much better developed romance: true life mates – oh, come on… haven’t we heard this enough? Of course, this book was published more than ten years ago, and by now the destined mate thing has got old. All in all, it’s not bad, but I don’t think I’ll continue the series for now. ",31,10
38568,A Quick Bite,Jilly,"1,838",6209,3,"June 1, 2017","I know I may talk a little more than is healthy normal about the coming robot apocalypse. It's just that I don't think people are taking this whole robots-are-going-to-kill-us-all thing seriously enough. They keep making creepier robots every day. Did anyone see that robot on The Tonight Show? Holy crap. That thing is definitely planning on murdering someone. Probably Jimmy Fallon.By the way, can we talk about the fact that ""Sophia's"" designer must have been male? Is there any other reason that she had to have such large breasts? I'm guessing they aren't extra battery packs, or any other reasonable explanation. Just a robot-designer who had a dream...Why am I on yet another robot rant when I am talking about a vampire book? Because this vampire world has the best explanation for the existence ever - nano robots in their bloodstream. These tiny robots cure disease, make them stronger and faster, stop cell degeneration, but feed off of their blood. So, they need to drink blood to replenish.In other words:The robots have transformed the humans into blood-thirsty killers! See? It's part of the master plan that all robots have!I knew it!!!So, although the romance was okay, but a little bland because the two main characters were about as exciting as milk (NOT chocolate milk). I loved the world where tiny micro-robots were the real killers.I also loved the Argeneau family and their dynamics, so I will continue this series happily. See? The robots have gotten to me. I'm totally on board.",25,1 comment

38568,A Quick Bite,Wendy,"1,047",13,5,"January 18, 2011","Loved this one. I have so many new series to read cos of developing a love for yet another romance genre, but I have to say this will be one of my favourite series if they are all the same as this. It was a light refreshing read, with none of the 'usual' formula romance angst etc. Unlike other reviewers, I liked the concept of the vamps coming from Atlantis. I am completely new to this genre and it's all fantasy/paranormal/romance to me anyway, so if the book is entertaining and keeps me reading I'm not too hung up on the details of their 'world' as it's all make-believe anyway. I loved the humour. I am always a sucker(!) for a book which is fun to read and this was. I thought the whole phobia thing was hilarious, but would have liked to have seen it resolved (not sure if it is in upcoming books??). Overall I loved the whole thing. The sex was hot, the romance was yummy and the characters were entertaining. No-one in the book annoyed me (which is great from mpov). Anyway, I loved it and will definitely be continuing with this series. (I have SOOOOOO many to start!)",18,9
38568,A Quick Bite,Jennifer,"1,721",6661,2,"August 5, 2015","A Quick Bite is the first installment in Lynsay Sands's vampire paranormal romance series titled Argeneau. I had never read anything from this author or this series before and I have to admit the popularity and impressive ratings had me pretty excited. This book ended up just being OK for me. I never really felt engaged in the storyline or connected with any of the characters. It was too easy to put the book down while reading and I kind of had a ""take it or leave it"" outlook. I considered adding it to my DNF shelf, not because it's bad but because there are too many books and too little time to read something that isn't completely capturing you. But I stuck it out...I mean have you seen how many books are in this series????? It's obviously working for plenty of loyal readers. I should note there were things I did like about A Quick Bite: I liked the fact that the female lead is the vampire while the male lead is the mortal. Usually it's always the man who wears the fangs. I also thought the blood phobia was an interesting addition to the vampire world. I mean, who would have thought lol? But like I said, overall it was just OK. I finished the book but didn't like it enough to continue the series. Two stars. The Argeneau series includes the following installments as of June 2015:#1:A Quick Bite#2:Love Bites#3:Single White Vampire#4:Tall, Dark & Hungry#5:A Bite to Remember#6:Bite Me If You Can#7:The Accidental Vampire#8:Vampires are Forever#9:Vampire, Interrupted#10:The Rogue Hunter#11:The Immortal Hunter#12:The Renegade Hunter#12.5:Bitten by Cupid#13:Born to Bite#14:Hungry for You#15:The Reluctant Vampire#15.5:The Bite Before Christmas#16:Under a Vampire Moon#17:The Lady is a Vamp#18:Immortal Ever After#19:One Lucky Vampire#20:Vampire Most Wanted#21:The Immortal Who Loved Me#22:About a Vampire#23:Runaway Vampire

38568,A Quick Bite,Anne Boleyn's Ghost,333,56,3,"April 10, 2018","A Quick Bite was a quick read. Fun enough, but not exactly “fang-tastic”.I have wanted to take a bite out of this series (wink, wink) for years. I was swept up in the paranormal craze of the late 2000s, from True Blood to the Immortals After Dark, and I heard that Lynsay Sands offered a lighter take on vampires.The book was humorous, both tongue-in-cheek (Lissianna, our heroine, is a vampire afraid of blood) and laugh aloud (when Lissianna and Greg need to make a quick getaway, she says that they will take “the bike” – and Greg, expecting to fly away on a motorcycle, is dismayed to instead find an actual bicycle). I didn’t feel that the main characters or their bond were very well-developed, likely due to ample introductions of supporting characters and explanations of the unique vampire mythology. That said, I appreciated that Greg was a different type of hero – more cerebral, easy-going, a good cook, a Beta male who still took charge in the bedroom. And while I thought that Lissianna’s bulb was sometimes too dim - her attempted murderer was the most obvious suspect in the history of obviousness - I did like how she was alternately shy and protective of Greg. All in all, it was enjoyable enough, but I'm not rushing to read the next installment.Read for SBTB Best Picture Quarterly Challenge: A paranormal romance.",13,5
38568,A Quick Bite,Lady Gabriella of Awesomeness (SLOW),518,760,4,"February 16, 2016",4.5 Quick Fun stars :)  A one-time read.Though I did throughly enjoy reading the book and its characters. Looking forward to reading the rest.,13,4
38568,A Quick Bite,Anzû,550,1107,1,"July 24, 2011","First of all I didn’t like this book AT ALL. The story was utterly boring, the main characters were irritating and the rest of the secondary ones seemed like they were added just to take up some space in the book. The author tried (maybe too hard) to make everyone likeable but she didn’t succeed. The hero and heroine have no chemistry, and all the hot and sweaty scenes just left me cold.More than once I thought of just deleting the damn book and picking on something better. I saw people compare this to an adult Twilight and I have to say they’re right.I eventually ended up skimming the last chapters because I couldn’t stand reading it anymore. Too much talk, very little action. I won’t even touch the rest of the series unless someone I trust recommends it to me.",12,2
38568,A Quick Bite,Tara,941,54,2,"February 9, 2010","...and they all lived cheesily ever after...Sigh, maybe it was because I kept putting off this series, maybe I was just on a book high from having really enjoyed the last 4 books, 3 of which were actually authors I'd never read before, or maybe it just wasn't a great book. I don't know. I wanted to like this book, I really did. I'd read the descriptions and reviews and it just didn't do it for me.Lissianna Argeneau is a vampire with a serious phobia and at 200+ years old, she needs to get over it. Luckily she comes from a very large and supportive family. Oh and did I mention that they get annoying after a while? There are female cousins and a friend and her one male cousin. Thomas, the sole male was witty enough that they didn't need the scantily clad, over-exuberant cousins. It was kind of funny at first but she went to that well too many times early on and by page 130 I was ready to be done with them.Dr. Greg Hewitt finds himself surrounded by this family and despite the fact that it is a romance you begin to wonder if they will ever be left alone long enough for the romance part of the book. Finally about 175 pages in or so Thomas gives a push and things start rolling. By the end of the happily ever after, there were still 60 pages left and then I remembered the very minor sub plot they'd been building throughout the book that I think was supposed to be funny but fell a little flat. Maybe it was because from the first moment it was introduced it was obvious what it was, maybe it felt a little forced, like it was added in to give the story more conflict or maybe it was because I just didn't think it was funny. Who knows?I think that I would have liked this book with less of her giggling cousins and a more integrated sub plot, I don't know. I know that I'm hoping this series gets better because I've gathered them all from paperback swap and can't see myself sending them back without at least trying 3 or 4 more... and if I still really never get into them, I'll skip to Thomas' book.In her acknowledgments section the author mentioned that the book was written out of order, so maybe that's why it felt off to me. I'm moving forward with Lynsay Sands and chalking this up to a bad first start.",10,9
38568,A Quick Bite,Slavena,260,29,2,"February 7, 2012","Lynsay Sands is a great author and I think that's why she can get away with a book like this. 60% of the book is introduction to the characters that will get their own books. I know it is hard to introduce your own fantasy world but putting 15 family members in this book was way too much for me, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, one big happy vampire family.I was extremely disappointed that the hero/heroine got very few minutes together without the family constantly interfering, I mean they walked in 2ce when Lissi was kissing Greg, when she was feeding of him, when they were having sex, and the person interrupting it is not like ""oops sorry"" and closing the door, no he marches in and starts up conversation. ""yeah I know that you are inside my cousin but I have to tell you that we have to go groceries shopping"" (that's not a quote from the book just making a point) I guess if you have discovery fantasies this book will rock your world, they are constantly getting caught.The other thing that was infuriating is the view of the vampires. They are created from Atlantis nano technology/bio-engineering with the main heroine, who is 200 years old knowing nothing about it, like she is not even interested in explaining anything. The mystery that is so alluring when you read about vampires is totally destroyed.One of the first scenes in the book is Lissi having a birthday party, turning 202. What does she do for her birthday - she stayed home with her siblings/cousins and had a pijama party all dressed up in teddies and their one male cousin, in a child's spiderman pajama. Mind you these are vampires 200-600years old. It was ridiculous that this made the cut for publishing. It didn't make me laugh, it made me sad. I am happy I didn't pay $8 for this book but got it from the library. If you want funny vampire romance read Kerrelyn Sparks. Don't even attempt this book",9,6
38568,A Quick Bite,Summer,"1,350",246,1,"August 5, 2009","I start this book thinking maybe it will be cute. The description of the book describes the main character Lissianna as a vampire with a tendency to faint at the site of blood. Silly, but not the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Dr. Gregory Hewitt is a psychiatrist who wakes up in Lissianna's bedroom tied up and she wants a bite. Interesting enough to be put on my to-be-read pile anyways. So I start reading it. Lissianna comes from a family of vampires. Her parents, siblings, and friends are all vampires too. It's also her 202nd birthday. She's had some bad luck finding some good food, and arrives early at her mothers for her birthday party. Vampire birthday party. That was strike number one. So she goes up to her room and finds Dr. Gregory all tied up and sexy and decides to open up her present early. She gets interrupted by her mother explaining that the present wasn't for eating, but for curing her phobia with blood. Lissianna sulks and heads back down to the party like a chastised child. That was strike two. The party winds down later and Lissianna and her friends and family are downstairs. All of the females are described as in pastel colored baby doll outfits. Oooookay. The vampires then all gather around asking what do you do at a pajama party. When someone explains they all try to decide which to do first. Should they tell scary stories? Gossip about boys? Riiiiiight. So that would be strike three. I don't require vampires in stories to be full of angst or anything like that but a vampire pajama party sorta crosses the line for me. She's supposed to be 202 years old for goodness sake. Perhaps the story gets better and less ...ridiculous later but I couldn't really stomach any more after that. ",9,1 comment
38568,A Quick Bite,bookznerd,153,33,4,"April 20, 2022",4⭐️2🌶A quick bite is the first installment in the vampire novel series by lynsay sands.Lissi is a vampire who has a phobia of blood. She faints every time she sees blood. Very useful for a vampire. Because of this she drinks the old-fashioned way from the human Self. For 50 years this is no longer allowed and people drink from blood from the blood banks. Her mother gets Greg to help her overcome her phobia. But actually they are soul mates I enjoyed the first part. Easy writing style and funny moments in the book. (cucumber in the pants😂)You read from the third pov what I really liked in this book. That way you got from both of them what they thought and not from one side. The other characters were also really nice and I'm really looking forward to meeting them in the next books. If you like wonderful funny romance books then I definitely recommend this series to read! You'll have these books out in no time,8,2
