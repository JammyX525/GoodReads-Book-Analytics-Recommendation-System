2299110,Acheron,Alex is The Romance Fox,"1,461",1079,5,"February 10, 2017","STILL MY ALL TIME FAVORITE IN THIS SERIES!!!Acheron was the first book I ever read by this author….. and it made me into a die-hard fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon (who up to this time, I had never heard of or knew about her books).I decided to read this book again, before getting started on Styxx. It’s amazing that, no matter how many times I read this book, it continues to consume all my senses…..pulled at my emotions all over again. I don’t remember when last I was so I absorbed into a world and characters that became so real to me. Acheron, a character that has stayed with me for a very long time.    Acheron’s life was an embodiment of tragedy and sadness and also of courage and happiness.I cried, I raged as I experienced his parents rejection, the cruelty, the torture and the abuse – physical, emotional and sexual - he endured by evil family and foes alike, the manner in which people exploited him with no regard to his being- like Artemis and Apollo. I felt his fear, his grief, and his pain, his joy.I struggled with the first part of the book, primarily because it was such a dark part of Acheron’s life.. I had some moments..  But the 2nd part is what made it so special for me. It was like I suddenly saw light after being in this tunnel of darkness with Acheron.There were so many memorable characters in this story that I either hated or loved with total passion.Acheron, beautiful, broken,lonely, lost.... Ryssa, Acheron’s sister who loved him and protected him where she could. And how she was used the same way like him by her father, who married her off to Apollo, who clearly had no feelings for her. And the final tragedy in her life and how much heartache it caused Acheron was so damn sad. 
Styxx, Acheron’s twin brother, who had turned away from him and had become the favored son at Acheron’s expense. Artemis …….have I ever hated a character so much as hers?? Her cruelty towards Archeron... I just love to hate her!!! Okay, I did feel a “tad” sorry for her… she lost the man that she realized too late, was the only man she loved… what, the “heifer” actually shed a tear or two…to no avail, I might add. Savitar, his dialogue is witty, funny...i had so many laughs with this very mysterious character..who is he really? A surfer god???  Tory, Acheron’s true love. What a fabulous character. I just fell in love with her from the first moment she gets up on stage to deliver her speech on the finding of Atlantis. And the scene where she finds Acheron, working as a builder at a construction place is an absolute HOOT!!!! And Simi……she has found a place in my heart. I adore her. Unforgettable, quirky, dangerous, sweet, enduring, cute and love her style  Acheron is her Akri. The dialogue and interaction between the two is spectacular. I adored the modern Greece parts in this story, so vividly described that made me feel that I was right there, on a Greek beach looking for Atlantis as well.I loved the connection and chemistry between Tory and Acheron. The interaction between them is so lovely....Having to go through some trials and tribulations and finally finding happiness together was more than satisfying for me……and I loved the connection between Acheron and Tory as a young boy, her grandfather had been rescued from war-ravaged Greece by Acheron and taken to America, where he was told stories about the lost city of Atlantis. Tory had been told those stories by her grandfather and it was the reason that she wanted to find Atlantis …it was destined that Acheron and Tory were meant to be together. Pre-ordained.So, arrived at the last page and still as unforgettable as before. 
 OF COURSE HE IS!!And now it’s time for me to meet up with Styxx and Acheron again!!! I am so looking forward to that!!!
1st Review 2011MY FAVOURITE OF ALL SHERRILYN KENYON'S BOOKS EVER!!!! I KEEP READING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN....ACHERON IS THE MOST AMAZING HERO.........OOPS...SHOULD THAT BE GREEK GOD!!!!!",182,58
2299110,Acheron,Justine,48,50,5,"August 8, 2008","This review is a little more involved for me, than most. I am a long time fan of the Dark-Hunter and Dream-Hunter series, by Sherrilyn Kenyon. Some might think this would dispose me to be lenient in my evaluation, fawning with my opinions. However, the opposite would prove to be true; I find that I have such high expectations for Ms. Kenyon’s books, at this point, that there was a better certainty that I would be disappointed. Truly, how could an author possibly deliver on all the anticipation that she has been building for readers such as me, since the introduction of this saga back in 2002, with Fantasy Lover? Serendipity strikes, though, and Ms. Kenyon not only delivers, she surpasses expectations, leaving them in the dust.Devotees of this series know that Ms. Kenyon can create heroes, villains and anti-heroes that readers cannot help but fall for, cheer for, even when the man of the hour may be the villain of the piece. She is also skilled at taking characters, such as Nick Gautier, and carving out places in our hearts for him, then turning him, so we are not sure if we should cheer him on, or wish him ill, but we just can’t; he is too deeply entrenched in our hearts at this point. Her characters have heart; they have souls; they have dark, cutting edge humor that carries them through some of the darkest places a soul would ever have to travel. The roll call of characters is impressive at this point; the readers of Acheron need to know their Dark-Hunter history, and reviewing a play list before picking up the book might not be a bad idea (unless, of course, you’re a geek gyrl like me, in which case these people are like fictional family members, already.)Acheron, son of Atlantean gods, born into a human body and cursed by the Fates, attracts readers like no other member of Ms. Kenyon’s cast of players. He struts upon her stage with a feral grace; he is Gothic, grim, and forbidding. Hades, he is downright scary; scarier than most of the villains by a margin so great a new form of measurement might need to be invented. But Ash is also the most heart wrenchingly vulnerable person in this world of damaged souls. This is hinted at in prior books in the series; his loneliness while surrounded by other cursed hunters is legendary. The secrets surrounding Ash are more tightly held than the whereabouts of Jimmy Hoffa’s final resting place or the real special blend of eleven secret herbs and spices. Until now. In this book that bears his name and his emblem, we learn so much about his history, and what forged the God we know in the current timeline of the series.Ms Kenyon addresses the pressing questions surrounding the relationship between Ash and Artemis, or as Simi calls her, the Heifer Goddess. We learn how and why Ash is such an irresistible, sexy beast. And the learning is not easy; it is a dark, twisted tale of abuse, degradation and despair. The first half of this book is darker than any previous Dark-Hunter or Dream-Hunter novel. The series is known for its blending of tension, sensuality, sharp dialog and humor. This is not absent from Acheron; but the first portion of this story is harsh, so readers must be prepared. Ms. Kenyon deals with issues of mental, emotional, verbal and physical abuse skillfully, but openly and honestly. This honest, but respectful handling of such a terrible subject helps raise this story from the realm of everyday fantasy to literature. Brain candy books are enjoyable, and can certainly get high marks, and are necessary parts of the fictional world. But “literature” asks difficult questions; does not flinch from ugly truths, and reflects our own truths back to us. Ms. Kenyon has achieved literary standing with Acheron. She offers a light and a lesson to those who have suffered from abuses of their own, in their real lives. You can endure; you can triumph; you are worthy of love, no matter what someone else has forced upon you in your past. In the words of Acheron, she also brings home a crucial lesson about power, manipulation and relationships: “just because you can doesn’t mean you should, and sometimes some things have to go wrong in order to go right.” A powerful lesson brought to you by a paranormal fantasy romance.The second half of this novel brings the reader to present day, in the every day, human world. For a time, anyway. Do not fear; we visit Kalosis, Katoteros, and Olympus before this world tour of torture and redemption is done.Humor returns in the form of Xiamara, or as most know her, Ash’s demon daughter, Simi. She still craves QVC shopping; ice cream with hot sauce; takes orders from Ash a little too literally; color codes her horns to her clothes; and protects her akri, as she calls Ash, with a devotion that is endearing and a little terrifying. Also, the ex-hunters who make appearances in this book enter into the same quick witted banter with Ash that all of the prior books are renowned for including. Especially rewarding for long time fans are encounters with Julian and Talon. The heroine, Tory, is a delight to get to know through, as well. She is spunky, stands 6’1’’, has a keen appreciation for all things Greek (the older the better); she stands up to Ash, his moods, and she swings a mean hammer. Saying anything else would be telling….This book really is a powerhouse of a read. The only cautionary comment would have to be that if you have not read the prior books, this may not be the best place to begin. The relationships and histories between the characters are critical to a full understanding, and a finer flavoring of this story. With Acheron, Ms. Kenyon proves once again that she truly is the Author Goddess, spinning tales that sweep you up into a world of dark desires, darker passions, and the enduring strength of the heart and the soul. Truly, this book is the total package; it even tells you how everything ends.I can’t wait to see where Ms. Kenyon takes us when we read Stryker and Jaden’s stories, the next two installments. One Silent Night is currently scheduled for a November 4, 2008 release. For myself, based on my experience with Acheron, when it comes out, November 4th will be a silent, but satisfying night for this Kenyon Minion.Author website: http://www.dailyinquisitor.com/hunter/ ",112,14
2299110,Acheron,Michelle,139,46,1,"August 25, 2008","I hated most of this book.Book 1 Acheron's torturous human life: Good stuff. Artemis was always a bitch.Book 2 Present Day: Crap shit. Did someone else write this book? I wasn't buying any of it, and I had many moments of extreme eye-rolling.I don't know what was worse, the horrible music and cheesey serenade in the club, or Acheron saying he wanted Tory on a platter. It didn't seem like those were things he would do or say at all.",94,25
2299110,Acheron,Sophia Triad,"2,239",3426,5,"November 1, 2017","Acheron Parthenopaeus or Apostolos (Atlantean God of Destruction) and Soteria or Tori Kafieri (Human)Apostolos: Απόστολος in greek, i.e. the man with a missionHis Soteria: Η Σωτηρία του in greek i.e. his salvationTheir song:Prison gates won't open up for meOn these hands and knees I'm crawlin'Oh, I reach for you, well I'm terrified of these four wallsThese iron bars can't hold my soul inAll I need is you, come please, I'm callin'And, oh, I scream for youHurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'Show me what it's likeTo be the last one standingAnd teach me wrong from rightAnd I'll show you what I can beSay it for me, say it to meAnd I'll leave this life behind meSay it if it's worth saving me(Savin' Me Nickelback)I think I have developed a major crush on Acheron after I read his book. I could write sonnets, haikuς and erotic poems to tell you all about my love for him BUT I think I will just describe his book for you. It is a very very long book, but it is not boring. It expands in two time periods roughly and it basically has six parts:TIME PERIOD 1: Starting on May 9, 9548 BC and finishing on April 10, 9526 BC with a short additional chapter that takes place in 7382 BC.Part 1: Appollymi’s sacrifice Part 2: The Diary of Ryssa, Princess of Didymos. The story until Ryssa is given to Apollo.Part 3: Acheron’s point of view. The story that starts when Ryssa’s diary finishes and concludes when Acheron - as finally a God- depends completely on Artemis in order to feed.Part 4: Acheron starts training his Dark Hunters (you may have already read this story in The Beginning-Dark-Hunter #0.5)TIME PERIOD 1: PRESENT DAYPart 5: When Acheron meets SoteriaPart 6: Epilogue and happily ever afterDuring the first time period (BC); Acheron experienced hatred, abandonment, betrayal, fear, pain, humiliation, weakness, torture, rape, hunger and thirst.Acheron was the kid that his parents did not want to know. He was abandoned in his uncle claws and his became his tsoulos, i.e. his trained whore who was sold to the richest people (men and women) in Atlantis. Acheron is a God, but during his childhood he was just a human. His mother Apollymi hid him in a mortal woman’ womb (a queen nevertheless) and he was born with his twin brother Styxx as a mortal baby. Only his eerie eyes proved his unique heritage. The problem is that as a human (before his god powers were unlocked), Acheron was so weak and easy to hurt. His mortal parents were afraid of him, so he was sent far away to his uncle and they did not want to know anything about what his uncle was doing to him.His sister Ryssa was the only one who loved him, but her love caused more trouble than good for poor Acheron.Goddess Artemis was his lover, his friend and then the worst manipulator and bitch.During the second time period (present); Acheron experiences pure love, commitment, unconditional sacrifice, trust and true friendship.His Soteria (Tori) will make him see the world in a different perspective. She will cherish him, embrace him, feed him even when he is not hungry (she is a Greek girl after all that needs to feed her loved ones until they burst), accept his past and acknowledge their common future.If the first time period represents the darkness and the desperation, the second time period represent the light and the hope.I loved the book as a whole, but I would like to point out two things that I found weird:1.	For someone who has been trained the art of seduction and all his life he was basically whoring himself; Acheron behaves far too innocently with Soteria in their intimate moments and there are many things that he had not tried before.2.	Acheron tries desperately to hide his old life and his negotiations with Artemis from the Dark Hunters who are also his friends. I mean, Why? Most of them have been raped at least once in their mortal life and all of them had been betrayed and humiliated more than once. I am sure they will understand when they find out about his sacrifices.",64,12
2299110,Acheron,UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish,"1,166",1569,5,"August 11, 2011","Caution - this book is not for the faint of heart! I'm going to keep this short because there are no words to adequately describe this book. It's one of the most emotional, gut wrenching, heartbreaking books I've ever read, but at the same time it was inspiring, uplifting and completely amazing. And I just can't find the words to do this book justice.If you're a fan of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter series, (and who isn't?) Acheron is a dream come true. We finally get the answers to so many questions and get into the heart of the true hero of the series. Acheron's story is so dark, so tragic and so gruesome, but our hero of heroes gets his happily ever after  as well.In general, the books in this series have fairly intense, explicit sexual scenes, but those parts of the book can be skipped over without losing the story if you're more comfortable doing so. I only mention this because in varying degrees, sex plays a big part in Acheron's story and some of it is emotionally, very dark. The bottom line - This is one of my absolute favorite books ever, and I can't tell you how many tissues I went through by the time I was done reading it. I came away loving Ash even more than I had before, and with a deeper respect for him.",63,28
2299110,Acheron,twinfish2,60,7,1,"October 22, 2010","This book was awful. The first part of the book was just the same thing over and over. Ok yes I get it he was abused, everytime he trusted someone they betrayed him, yes I get it move on. At one time I actually held the book in the air and screamed I GET IT, MOVE ON ALREADY!!!! My aunt,whom I was visiting, thought I was crazy. Tory was weak, weak, weak,as a character and just not right for acheron at all. Well since he turned into a wimp in this book maybe they did make a good couple? I think maybe Acheron and Phury from J.r. wards lover enshrined, took a class together on how to become whiney wimps, and they both graduated with A's in my opinion. In this class an A was not the grade to shoot for. I am done with buying the dark hunter series after this train wreck and her dream warrior books.",56,13
2299110,Acheron,Princess under cover,517,238,1,"March 5, 2019","This was the book that I HIGHLY ANTICIPATED and pined for it and yearned for it, and after all that expectations building I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.1. It was LONG. I don't mind a long book as long as it keeps me riveted, and given all the convoluted back story around Acheron, I figured - it's gonna be a blast and I'm gonna gobble up every word. Not so.2. The h was meh. She just wasn't anything special, and kind of random in terms of fated to be for Acheron. He deserved someone truly special, but she was.... nothing special.3. Maybe this book started it or helped the trend escalate - the whole sexual torture thing. I'm not a fan. I've read plenty of books with this plot device, but I just felt like it was delved into with too much detail here and turned me off. Plus, it's a departure from the vibe of the rest of the series to this point, so it felt kinda disjointed and out of place.Overall, I think it was my built-up expectations that made this a flop for me. Never build up expectations, I've learned over the years! It's also the book that turned me off the series FOREVER AFTER! I have not read (nor any desire to read) another one of SK's books since.",53,11
2299110,Acheron,Jo ★The Book Sloth★,482,418,5,"August 8, 2014","The heroes:Acheron...From the very first moment I read about Acheron I was in love. The mysterious, sexy, brooding, loving goth Dark Hunter leader captured my heart from the first page! He is powerful but tries not to take advantage of his power even when people let him down left and right. He takes care of those he loves and protects those he feels responsible for, he is always there when the others need him and never asks for sth in return. You can't dislike him if you try. (Although at some points I thought everything would be better if he killed one or two or a hundred people!):PTory...Tbh Tory isn't what I had in mind for Acheron. I wanted a heroine a little more punk-ish. Maybe a badass with blades and scars(someone like Tabitha) but Tory had her own advantages. She was fearless, loyal and accepted Acheron just as he was. In the beginning I didn't like her at all because she seemed like a judgemental bitch but she grew on me.Simi...I ABSOLUTELY ADORE Simi! I love the little demon girl... She is a combination of wisdom and naivity, naughtiness and innocence and you really can't help liking her, just like her Akri. Artemis...Artemis is a royal bitch! She takes advantage of Acheron and hurts him in every opportunity, she is uncaring, heartless, selfish, cold. She thinks only of what she wants and she doesn't care who has to be hurt to get it. So of course I'm a fan!;)There are many others, Apollymi(whom I love), Lysa(for whom I don't feel neither hot nor cold), Nick(who starts to get on my nerves), the Dark Hunters and the Weres but if I list them all the review will be longer than the book!The story.The story is written in two parts, the first one is Acheron's past(11.000 years ago), and the second part is in the present.Acheron's past was painful to read and I mean it, I felt pain in every page. I've read the book about 10 times and I can't bring myself to re-read the ""past story"". Acheron has suffered every way a human can suffer, he has been shamed every way a human can be shamed, every awful thing someone can think of has been done to him. I really was impressed that with so much abuse he didn't become feral.In the present Acheron continues to put up with Artemis' abuse but she is the only one that dares hurt him(and dare she does). I really don't get why he let even her but I guess if you kick someone one time too many... Of course with the love and understanding of our heroine he'll get over the past...blah blah blah. This was kind of expected. The ""present"" story was entertaining, funny and sweet but nothing really original. I think I liked it more because Acheron finally got his HEA than I did because of the story itself.Generally the book was addictive. Do I think it could have been much better? Yes I definitely do...Did I like it regardless? Yeap...I loved it!",49,18
2299110,Acheron,Kat valentine ( Katsbookcornerreads),583,761,5,"July 2, 2018","I reread this this weekend,and it still brings tears to my eyes what Acheron went though at the hands of people who were suppose to love and take care of him and the sick terrible things that the gods did to him also.The first half of this book is a gut wrenched.But the second half is full of redemption and Acheron finding love and for the first time in his life knowing the touch of someone who did not want to hurt him in some way! Soteira is determined not to be put off by Acheron's bad ass actions and soon these two very different people will both have their moment of happiness and forever!!!

2299110,Acheron,♡Karlyn P♡,605,1202,5,"August 13, 2008","Loved it. Best in the series, hands down. It is an emotional read, but I think some of the reviews (on here and on other boards) are over doing it a bit when reviewing the first part. I think its scaring some fans away! Truth is it is an emotional, bitter-sweet tortured hero story with an HEA. It's a captivating, enthralling, and non-stop page turning read. It is also funny and heart warming with some surprising twists that will make dark-hunter fans cheer! I think JR Wards books are equal in the emotional angst and tortured hero storyline, so dark-hunter fans should not hold off for fear of getting too emotional. Its an amazing survival story, and it truly is Kenyon's best piece of work. I loved how she used first-person writing in several of the chapters, it really added so much. And the world building remained solid and true to what we learned it all her other books, but it was great to read the history of Acheron and the dark-hunters all in one book. (instead of bits and pieces in all of her other books.) Ash's heroine was great, and this romance felt much more believable than many of Kenyon's recent books. This book will be a hard act for Kenyon to follow, but I am so glad to have it. ",42,12

  0.5 star a.k.a did not like it at all
Frustrating and depressing. I decided to read this because it has amazing ratings. Warning: I used a lot of the word 'too'This is not for me. All of the characters were too evil, except one. Yes, Acheron. Unfortunately I didn't like him either. While others were too cruel, he was too kind. I didn't care with everything else anymore because the characterization was already a major problem with this book.Acheron was too tortured. Way too much. It was too sad. Every single character in this book was too weird I liked Acheron's sister. She was the only character who had my simpathy. But guess what? She was killed. Oh Blast! especially Acheron's mother. For goodness sake, her son has been tortured emotionally, physically, sexually, FOR YEARS!!! MORE THAN A DECADE! And she didn't do anything, ANYTHING AT ALL. Whatever reason she had (to save her son, to protect him, blah, blah, blah) I just couldn't bear it. Too much for me. There were also Acheron's father and his uncle. Both of them were the male version of cinderella's stepmother with the level of cruelty that beyond my imagination. I couldn't believe they were actually human being.Then we had Artemis. What in the world was going on with her? She kissed Acheron, slapped him, hurted him, made love to him, kissed him again, slapped him again, hurted him again, made love to him more and more and so on and again.. and Acheron just accepted it all with a humble heart. Perhaps she was too damn sexy so Acheron was totally fine with some sport like beating-kicking-punching-'till-bleeding after sex. What a saint! I tried, really, to hold on..But after 300 pages I was still wondering where's the heroine?White flag.",41,36

It will break your heart into more pieces than possible and then put it back together better than it ever was to begin with.   THIS IS NOT A STAND-ALONE!!!!!  I can’t say much about the book because literally everything that happens in it from start to finish is basically one giant spoiler… but it tells the story of Acheron, a deeply tortured, powerful, heart-stoppingly gorgeous and yet utterly mysterious character who we have seen over the past 14 books.The first half of the book tells his back story. From birth to adulthood, what happened to him is heart wrenching. Unspeakably horrific. Incomparably violent. Sickeningly abusive. Both physically and emotionally shattering. Acheron is without a doubt, THE most tortured character in the history of paranormal romance… or maybe just, ever.The second half of the book tell his present day story… and what leads to his beautiful happily-ever-after. To have a character go from a place of the ultimate suffering, the ultimate humiliation, and the ultimate torment to a place of ultimate peace, happiness, healing, love and acceptance was heart-warming to an extreme. So beautiful. Having seen all the horrors that happened to him, it makes you appreciate every moment of joy as beyond precious. If ever there was a character that deserved a happy ending, its Ash. Love you Ash <36 stars**Edit: I just a re-read of ACHERON. If you haven’t already tried this series out, they are, hands down, my  absolute favorite paranormal romance series  out there – the perfect blend of very tortured heroes (literally and figuratively), strong heroines, engaging plot, intricate mythology, heart touching moment, steamy love scenes, some of the funniest moments you will ever read in a book, and the absolute sweetest HEAs.But be sure to READ THEM IN ORDER!!! (lol, yes, shouty caps were necessary ) This book is not book 1... I would strongly recommend AGAINST starting with it... it will ruin a lot of the rest of the series for you.For the complete reading order, click HERE.Really guys, if you haven’t read this series, and you are are looking for an amazing PNR series, run out and get yourselves book 1.

2299110,Acheron,Penny,717,206,4,"September 21, 2020","Rating Clarification: 4.5 stars.Acheron is an incredible book, the best of this series hands down. The only defect for me is that the second part is not as strong as the first one. Acheron is a memorable character. He is part of every single book of this series, and finally getting to know this mysterious and essential character was a treat, fantastic. The book is divided in two very different parts:The first part is Ash's past, his life story. It was full of heart and soul, emotionally wrecking. I absolutely loved it, it was incredible.However, the second part paled in comparison. After such an overwhelming and painful past, his present, his true love story, deserved to be much more than what he got. It was truly disappointing to read just a normal romance next to such a strong first half. I wish his love story could have been memorable,like his life was, instead of just one of many in the Dark Hunter series. He deserved EPIC. I'll keep reading the Dark Hunter series, but this book is going to be hard to top.Dark Hunter #14: Acheron - 4.5 stars.Dark Hunter #16: Dream Warrior - 2 stars - DNFDark Hunter #21: Time Untime - 2 stars - DNF",36,13
2299110,Acheron,Julie (jjmachshev),"1,069",281,5,"August 9, 2008","Whew. I finished ""Acheron"" by Sherrilyn Kenyon in the wee hours of the morning. Even though I picked up the book on Tuesday, I held off starting in on it until after work on Friday because I KNEW that once I started I wouldn't put it down until I finished it. I was right. Acheron's story was larger than life, just like Acheron himself. My emotions ran the gamut from despair to joy as I read his story. As others have commented, the first part of the book was almost painful to read. Each time I finished a chapter and thought, ""Whew, now things will get better for him."" But they didn't. I liked the fact that the author warned us in her note at the beginning of the book that the story would be painful. Reading that she herself has firsthand knowledge of childhood abuse made Acheron's past that much more poignant. But by providing a happy ending for him, Kenyon really made this book a paean to all those who have experienced abuse and overcome.I won't take the time to retell any of his story. Suffice to say that until the age of 21, Acheron's suffering was horrific and endless. My emotions are still reeling, hours after I finished with the happy ending. Will I reread this book? My first instinct is to say no...but I think that time will likely change my mind. Does that make this a great book? I don't know that either. But I DO know that those are just a few things that make this a book I will never forget.",36,26
