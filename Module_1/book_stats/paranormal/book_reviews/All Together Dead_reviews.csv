140075,All Together Dead,Chloe,347,528,5,"November 9, 2008","You know the worst thing about these books? They're like cotton candy. On face they look incredibly filling and satisfying but then you bite into them and the fluffy candy mass turns into so much sugar and you're just as hungry when you're finished as you were when you started. Except now you're out of money and your mom wants you to ride the Ferris wheel with your little sister.I've devoured all seven of the Sookie books and now I want more, except there aren't any more. Yet. No one should confuse these books for great literature, but they are sure as hell entertaining.",213,19

140075,All Together Dead,Calista,"3,791",31200,5,"May 21, 2020","This is my favorite book in the whole Sookie Stackhouse series. It's so different and I love Eric in this story.Sookie has to fly to Dallas, I think, for a convention of Vampires where she has to help save the Vampire Queen Sophie-Anne, by listening in to all the humans. She meets the Bellboy, who can also hears voices. There are plots everywhere and it's all tied together thickly. Sookie is still dating Quinn, the were-tiger. Sookie is always in danger. She uses logic and her gifts to figure out what is going on. The fellowship of the Sun play a huge part in this storyline. I love that Claudine, the fairy godmother is back and I like her.My favorite is the ending of this story where Sookie and Eric survive the ending. It's epic and unpredictable and this story really is the best of the story in my mind. Everything comes together and makes for an intersting and out of nowhere ending.I was so disappointed when HBO didn't use this story for the TV series. They stopped before they got here. It's too bad. The series goes on for another 6 books and it's too long. It should have ended sooner. ",37,N/A
140075,All Together Dead,Miranda,402,2,1,"November 4, 2008","Snooze fest. The avalanche of characters and the painful descriptions of the wedding just came so ridiculous, and I had to skip many pages. I am not the biggest fan of Quinn -- so that could be my reluctance to this book. I just wish Sookie would go to Eric and stop fighting her feelings. ",34,4
140075,All Together Dead,Geraldine O'Hagan,110,132,1,"October 19, 2011","Yet another of the thrilling adventures of prize bitch Sookie Stackhouse. She is certainly on form. There are half a dozen pointless descriptions of the characters’ outfits and a horrendously awful sex scene in the first 30 pages alone. Sookie continues to bitch about every other woman’s sex life and fashion sense, despite the fact that in both cases her own are questionable at best. Meanwhile what plot there is slowly stutters into life. Sookie travels to Rhodes with various ‘supes’, giving her the opportunity to use an aeroplane toilet for the first time and tell us for what seems like the twelfth time exactly how to pronounce Mr. Cataliades. I have no idea why Harris’ has such a bee in her bonnet about this. Some characters we don’t know die off screen. Nothing happens for a long time. There’s a brief incident with a bomb, which comes to nothing. Then Sookie gets to try on a pretty dress, a situation which fills her with excitement and is described, along with all her accessories and underwear, at great length. After some talking, the dress is briefly endangered by the bleeding of her boyfriend when he is seriously injured, but luckily it survives without stains. We are then treated to another example of how incredibly sexually provocative vampires find Sookie’s dancing, followed by a bit of sulking from Sookie’s jealous boyfriend due to someone else touching his woman. Finally the plot creeps to a peak with the bombs that have been hanging around for most of the book finally exploding. None of the important characters are killed, but as a by-product of the events Sookie gets to hail a cab for the first time, which is pretty thrilling for her. She also strips a sleeping man naked without his permission and gets into bed with him whilst similarly unclad, but this passes without comment. Until the following morning, when it belatedly occurs to her that it was a bit of a weird thing to do.Most Laughable Statement “Sookie is good at thinking outside the box.” This being the same Sookie who is sickened by the sight of a woman without a tan, and considers having satin sheets or more than one piercing per ear a sign of depravity and social dysfunction.Worst Named New CharactersElmer Claire Vaudry – A female, apparently.Johan GlassportOlive TroutCindy Lou SuskinNone of which rate a mention from Sookie. She does however find it impossible even during a serious trial not to laugh at a female vampire being called Jodi. Granted not the greatest spelling, but since Sookie is able to regularly serve drinks to someone called Jeff LeBeff without giggling I wouldn’t have thought it would cause her too much trouble to keep a straight face.Least Appealing Opening to a Sex Scene “But in the next moment, his eyes got that focused look men get when they’re thinking about sex very specifically.” Phrases that Should Not be Used During a Sex Scene “He tugged my top out of my pants and began exploring territory he’d only visited briefly before”  “Mmmmm”  “little bitty panties”  “Oh, boy”  “This is like standing in front of a buffet,” he said. “I don’t know where to begin.” I touched my breasts. “First course,” I suggested. "" ""“I dreamed of this,” he said, and shoved inside me up to the hilt” A usual, Harris indulges in yet more unrealistic and embarrassing sex scenes featuring yet another massively well-endowed man who can barely control himself at the sight of a woman in bra.Phrases that Should Not be Used After a Sex Scene “I was pleasantly aware of the tenderness I felt south of my belly button”  “His lips were so warm and firm, they reminded me of something else that had been warm and firm.”  “Even through the condom, I’d been able to feel the heat.” More of Sookie’s Judgemental Bitchery Towards Other Women “I’d always figured Jason wouldn’t marry a woman I truly adored; he’d always shown a partiality to tough sluts. And that was Crystal, sure enough.” “Carla was getting dressed (thank God) in what I thought of as “classy whore.”” Least Interesting Question to Ask a VampireSookie finally gets around to asking Pam how she became a vampire and Pam reveals that she was turned in the Victorian era. Sookie, given this unprecedented opportunity to ask any question about human or vampire life and experiences in the last century and a half, goes with the following: “Did you wear your hair up every day?” Apparently, yes, Pam did wear her hair up every day. Sookie’s curiosity about Pam and the entirety of history from the Victorian era onward thus satisfied, the conversation ends.Most Random Self-Assessment “I wasn’t too pleased with myself for being so judgmental” Really Sookie? It’s certainly not been summat that bothered you before. Nor, apparently, will you have any further qualms about judging everyone you meet. So, a reformed character for roughly 12 seconds. Stupidest New Supernatural BeingsBritlingen. Super-bodyguards from another dimension, apparently. Despite these credentials, Sookie’s description of one of them runs to her having ”feathery ash-brown hair that needed a good stylist”.  What makes her think they have stylists in this unnamed alternative dimension I’m not sure, but obviously having a good hair-do would be of paramount importance to an enslaved warrior from another world.Most Blindly Patriotic Outlook “In a moment, I understood that I hadn’t even thought about worrying because I’d grown up a free United States human citizen; I wasn’t used to worrying about my fate being in question” Because of course in the Good Ol’ USA there is no social injustice and the legal system is swift and flawless.Least Likely Choice of Artist for a Vampire Band to CoverJennifer LopezWorst Synonym for Dancing “pretty soon we were shaking our bonbons all over the place” Most Inappropriate Response to Your Friend Having Been in a Massive Anti-Vampire Terrorist Explosion  “Oh, my God! Your new clothes!” What plot there is being over, and all the usual lines and events trotted out yet again, the book finally concludes with the most hokey ending possible, short of “they lived happily ever after”: “We went inside with the sun bright on our backs and our shadows preceding us into the old house.” ",29,22
140075,All Together Dead,Sarah Elizabeth,"4,670",1268,4,"November 15, 2015","I quite enjoyed this book, although it did remind me a bit of ‘Living Dead in Dallas’ where Sookie is also asked to go with the vampires to use her telepathic abilities, and finds another telepath called Barry, who also shows up in this one.This book was a bit slow and heavy-going in places, but I still enjoyed it, and I liked the unexpected twist at the end, as I really didn’t see it coming!  Who knew that the Fellowship would blow up the hotel, leaving loads of vampires burned or missing limbs?! Shocking! 7 out of 10[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",29,N/A
140075,All Together Dead,Erin ,"1,200",1105,3,"September 27, 2020",Its always more difficult to write a review for a book the deeper you get into a series. All Together Dead is the 7th book in Sookie Stackhouse series(True Blood) so I'm at a loss as to what to say about this book. So I'll just give a few small things I noted in this book.1) Very little Bill 2) Bill is still the worst3)Not enough Eric4)Sookie is still irresistible to all men for some reason5)Lots of death and violence If you like the series then I think you'll continue to like this installment. ,26,3
140075,All Together Dead,Becky,"1,308",1595,2,"November 7, 2008","**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Again, I have to mention that this series is in desperate need of a decent editor. I mentioned this in my review of Book 5 (Dead as a Doornail): ""Jason's boss is Shirley (Catfish) Hennessey in Book 4, but in Book 5, all of a sudden he's Shirley (Catfish) Hunter. What?!?"" In Book 7, we're now back to a version of Hennessey, although it's misspelled as ""Hennessy"". This series as a whole, is interesting, mysterious and sexy. I feel the need to find out where this is all going, but this book certainly felt like it was missing something that contributed to the earlier books' ""unputdownability."" Maybe it was Sookie and Bill's relationship, which I loved, that kept me wanting more. Even though I knew it couldn't last through the entire 8 book series (so far, anyway), I have held out hope for their relationship. There are hints that a reconciliation may be in the works, but it seems unlikely that will happen at this point. The more I think about the later books in the series, the more Sookie frustrates me. She burns bridges before she's even crossed them fully, and cuts people entirely out of her life, for the silliest reasons I have ever seen. She holds grudges and makes off-the-cuff life-changing decisions that make no sense to me. Maybe it is her sense of pride that causes her to do this, or maybe she is jaded by being able to know peoples' intimate thoughts, I just don't know. I still don't understand why she was so upset with Alcide. Please, someone explain it to me. Really. So he knew about Debbie. So? He had abjured her, and its not like he was going to turn Sookie in, or kill her. I think that Sookie was pissed at him for having the audacity to know what happened and still like her. Or, how about this mystery... Why was Sookie angry with Quinn after finding out he was a fighter? Hmm? These things are lost on me. I don't get what the big deal is. But anyway, I'm ranting. Nothing was resolved for me in this book like I had hoped at the end of the 6th book. I'll renew that hope for the 8th book, and also up the ante and hope that Sookie learns to relax a little and stop acting so damn high & mighty. She is not perfect herself, so I wish she would stop expecting others to be. *nod*",24,10
140075,All Together Dead,Wanda Pedersen,"1,807",348,4,"March 29, 2019","2019 Re-ReadAnother evening, another Sookie Stackhouse book. At least I managed to cook some dinner last night, although my kitchen is still a mess. I have to find a way out of this groove I have found myself in—there are other things I need to be reading and other tasks that need my attention. But I may only find the way out by finishing up this series as a re-read.I’ve always felt that this is the book where Sookie proves that she has good judgment—she seems to understand the plots and conspiracies of the vamp world better than they do, perhaps because she’s an outsider to that world and able to observe it dispassionately. This talent of hers, which Eric calls “thinking outside the box,” attracts unwanted attention from the Queen and her sidekick, Andre. Staying unbound to them is proving difficult. Instead, she ends up bound to Eric the Uncertain. Eric runs hot and cold towards Sookie, unwilling to admit that he’s unusually attracted to a human woman. It seems kind of like the men who’d like to sleep with a woman but don’t want to be seen with her in public. Good for Sookie, standing up for herself and her right to be acknowledged.I think just about everyone has been unappreciated at a job at some point in their life. Sookie gets her moment of this as she holds a bomb that she’s scared to set down, waiting for the bomb squad to show up, talking to a bystander about her status in the vamp scene:”Ha,” I said. “Oh, ha-ha. Yeah, ‘cause they love me. You see how many vampires are up here? Zero, right?”“One,” said Eric, stepping out of the stairwell.Lots of foreshadowing for upcoming installments. On to book 8, From Dead to Worse this evening.***** Original review:Yay, Sookie finally has a woman friend! We are getting into Bechdel test territory, as they are close to having conversations about something besides men and Bob the cat (an unfortunate man turned into a cat by Sookie’s friend Amelia, when trying some magic that she shouldn’t have been messing with).And if Sookie doesn’t get the vampire-employee-of-the-year award for her performance in this book, I want to know the reason why. The undead had better acknowledge her courage and value in the next installment.I know that a lot of people see casual racism in the Sookie series, but Harris does tackle the prejudice issue in this novel, albeit the bias of the living against the undead and the vampires and werewolves against each other. Easier to tackle in fictional creatures than in actual populations, perhaps (like the memorable Star Trek episode with the half black/half white aliens who discriminate based on which side of the face is black or white). Having finished the previous novel, I picked this one up immediately and plunged forward. When I looked up, it was 2 a.m. and I had just set myself up for a draggy Saturday. Despite that, I have no regrets, but I will try to resist the next installment until I’m caught up a bit on my library books.",20,2
140075,All Together Dead,Katty,448,18,4,"November 26, 2008","My absolute favorite Sookie stackhouse to date. A lot of stuff happens in this book, but towards the end the action is great and goes somewhere you weren't really sure Ms. Harris would take you. Sookie travels to a Vampire Summit with Queen Sophie-Ann's entourage, which lends to some hilarious moments with different vamps and the fangbangers at their side. Like I said before, there is a lot more action then in previous books which is just exciting. Plus Quinn and Eric play for sookie's interest. When I started reading this series I was afraid it would follow the same old formula every time, but thats not really the case here and i'm glad. Charlaine Harris is building great stories one on top of the other and they are surely going to lead to something great.",18,N/A
140075,All Together Dead,Pam Nelson,"3,069",96,5,"June 8, 2017","5 All Together Dead Stars Well, well Sookie gets herself into some pretty crazy predicaments. I have to say I really liked the Vampire Summit, and how Sookie helps and gets put into some danger. Quinn the shifter is yummy and I liked that he seems to really be in lust with her and she with him. Andddd then poof Erik comes into play and they end up getting closer than they were. Sookie is starting to hear Vampire brains and that can be verrry dangerous for her if anyone finds out. Although I love Sookie with Quinn.. I have my heart set that she will end up with Erik. On to another book :)*You don't have to like my review but its 100% my opinion, and I am allowed to have it.*",17,2
140075,All Together Dead,Jilly,"1,838",6209,3,"June 30, 2015","So, there's a big event that has a lot of protesters who want to kill all of the people at the event. All of the people attending this event are staying at the same hotel which supposedly has great security, because, again, there are crazies who literally would LOVE to kill everyone in attendance. Soon after arrival, each and every party gets a phone call from the management of the hotel saying that there is an extra piece of luggage that belongs to them and they need to come down and pick it up. As they go down to get this unidentified luggage, they notice that there are representatives from each group of attendees also picking up their extra bags. Nobody seems to be missing luggage. Nobody claims these extra pieces and they sit in the rooms of these guests, unclaimed. Are you seriously telling me that nobody would consider this suspicious? Post 9/11? I find that very hard to believe. Basically, this hotel has worse security than your local elementary school. Who is the head of security? Paul Blartt, mall cop?
  
Did people actually pay money to watch this movie? I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that there is a sequel to it...So, Sookie is going to the Vampire Convention to assist the Queen because you know that all-powerful creatures that are hundreds of years old need the brain trust that is a 27 yr old redneck waitress from a podunk town to keep them safe. And, it pays off, big time. Even though this girl has never even been in an airplane before, and says ""gosh"" with wide-eyed wonder at the big city lights, she is constantly uncovering plots that the vampires can't seem to figure out even though they are being hit over the head with clues. I guess they are technically brain-dead, right?Also, Sookie is all fired up about her were-tiger boyfriend, Quinn. And, why shouldn't she be awed by him? He is a giant bald-headed guy whom she is constantly comparing to a genie. 
  I'd had time to appreciate his outfit while he spoke. He was wearing full trousers that gathered at the waist and the ankle. They were deep scarlet. He had cinched the trousers with a wide gold belt like a prizefighter's, and he was wearing black leather boots with the trouser legs tucked in. He wasn't wearing a shirt. He looked like a genie who'd just popped out of a really big bottle.

  
Well, hello, sexy! Really???? She could be with Eric! (Yes, I know I complain about this in every review. Shut up! Have you seen Eric? I know you have - in every other one of my reviews on this series!)
  
I don't want to break with tradition...So, the choice is between him and a genie. Hmmmmm....
  
Some people are clearly better decision-makers than others...This book was vampire focused, instead of Were focused, which I liked. The vampire politics and their cold-bloodedness is much more entertaining than the shape-shifters. The story was entertaining enough, even though you want to smack Sookie upside the head a lot. But, I want to smack her upside the head pretty often, so that's nothing new.",16,6

  It would have been more help to me if he'd come ten minutes earlier... or not at all.
Useless as always. Is Quinn supposed to be interesting and are we supposed to care about his relationship with Sookie? And i thought that her relationship with Bill was boring.I feel like the start wasn't THAT strong but i was really invested after like 100-150pages. It was a fun read. Honestly if you enjoyed the other 6 books, you will also enjoy this one.",16,N/A
