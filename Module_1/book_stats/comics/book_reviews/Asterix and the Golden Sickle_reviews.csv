122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"December 2, 2020","La Serpe d'or = Asterix and the Golden Sickle (Asterix, #2), René Goscinny Asterix and the Golden Sickle is the second volume of the Asterix comic book series, by René Goscinny (stories) and Albert Uderzo (illustrations). It was first serialized in Pilote magazine issues 42–74 in 1960. Disaster strikes in the Gaulish village when Getafix the druid breaks his golden sickle, as without one, he cannot attend the annual conference of druids, or cut mistletoe for the magic potion which keeps the Roman army at bay. Asterix and Obelix set out for Lutetia (present-day Paris) to buy a new sickle from Obelix's distant cousin. On the way there, they encounter bandits, but easily defeat them, and learn from a fellow-traveller that ""sickles are in short supply in Lutetia (The Roman city of Lutetia was the predecessor of present-day Paris.)"". In the city, they find Metallurgix is missing and make inquiries at a local inn, but the landlord professes to know nothing. He later gives a description of Asterix and Obelix to the devious Clovogarlix, who in turn directs them to his superior Navishtrix, who tries to sell them a sickle at an exorbitant price. They refuse, and defeat Navishtrix and his followers, only to be arrested by a Roman patrol. They are released by the Prefect of Lutetia, Surplus Dairyprodus, and learn from a Centurion that Metallurgix may have been kidnapped by sickle traffickers. From a drunkard imprisoned by Dairyprodus, they learn Navishtrix has a hideout at a portal dolmen in the Boulogne forest. In Navishtrix's underground store-room, Asterix and Obelix find a hoard of golden sickles, but are attacked by Clovogarlix, Navishtrix and their minions. Upon defeat, Navishtrix escapes, and Asterix and Obelix follow him to Surplus Dairyprodus, who confesses to having sponsored the illegal sickle monopoly for his own amusement. The Centurion releases Metallurgix and imprisons Dairyprodus and Navishtrix; whereafter Metallurgix gratefully gives Asterix and Obelix the best of his sickles. With this, they return to their village and celebrate their achievement.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز دوم ماه می سال 2003میلادیعنوان: ماجراهای آستریکس و ابیلیکس کتاب دوم: آستریکس و داس طلایی؛ نویسنده: رنه گوسینی؛ مترجم: مهدی شاه خلیلی؛ تهران، لک لک، 1381؛ از ماجراهای آستریکس و ابیلیکس کتاب دو؛ در 46ص؛ مصور رنگی؛ گروه سنی ج د؛ شابک 9646488463؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، تاریخ فرهنگ، 1383؛ شابک 9647135661؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، کلام، 1385؛ شابک 9646143709؛ موضوع داستانهای فکاهی مصور از نویسندگان فرانسوی سده 20ممترجم: فریبرز افروزی؛ تهران، سامر، 1391؛ در 48ص؛ شابک 9786006444031؛در این داستان، داس طلایی «گتافیکس ـ کاهن دهكده» گم می‌شود؛ این در حالیست که گردهمایی سالانه ی کاهنان «گال»، به زودی برگزار خواهد شد، و «گتافیکس» بدون داس طلایی، نمی‌تواند معجون جادویی تهیه کند؛ از همین رو، دو قهرمان بزرگ دهکده ی «گال»، «آستریکس» و «ابلیکس» نامزد می‌شوند، برای خرید یک داس طلایی تازه، به خانه ی «آمریکس»، پسرعموی «ابلیکس» در «لوتنیا» بروند؛ آنها پس از، پشت سر گذاشتن دشواریهای بسیار، به «لوتنیا» می‌رسند؛ اما «آمریکس» را نمی‌ابند، و متوجه می‌شوند که چندیست داس‌های طلایی او نیز کمیاب و گران شده‌ اند، سپس ماجراهایی روی می‌دهد که شرح آن در ادامه ی داستان آمده استتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 11/09/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",65,N/A
122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,Duane,828,387,4,"February 13, 2018","I came across the first book in this series Asterix the Gaul on “Guardians 1000 books to read before you die” list, liked it enough to give this, the second book a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, not just of the writing but also the graphic drawings. Goscinny wrote the first book around 1960, and even though he died in 1977, the series continues with the 37th edition published in 2017.",45,1 comment
122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,NAT.orious reads ☾,815,322,4,"January 15, 2023",I mean what can I say except that it's nostalgia? My dad loved these comics so my mum would encourage us all to watch the films when they were on.

122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,David Sarkies,"1,772",300,4,"October 7, 2017","Asterix busts open a sickle smuggling racket15 April 2012	Well, it turns out that the second Asterix book is actually really entertaining. It is a little difficult to compare them to Tintin though, especially since the first Tintin books appeared in the 1930s while it was not until the 1960s that the Asterix books began to appear. However, while it took a few albums for Herge to begin to set Tintin on the path that he was going to go, it appears that Asterix reached that position pretty quickly. However, and I will have to revisit this statement a bit later when I have read a lot more of them, the Asterix books seem to become a little ho-hum down the track.	Anyway, this story involves Getafix breaking his golden sickle, and he needs it not only to make the magic potion, but to also go to the Druid's conference in the forest of Carnutes. Therefore Asterix and Obelix set out to travel to Lutetia (Ancient Paris) to attempt to get a new sickle. However, when they get there they discover that Obelix's cousin, Metalurgix the sickle maker, has gone missing and nobody wants to talk to them about it.	We begin to see the subtle humour that is being drawn into these comics, where they begin to treat the Roman civilisation as akin to our own, with all of the bureaucracy and the infrastructure that we see around us. One scene has them walking past an aqueduct that is being built, and them commenting about all of the eyesores that are being put up. Then there is the Roman road they travel along with the slaves repairing the road and thus a slow sign being put up, and the chariot driver who speeds past and then is later pulled over by a Roman soldier and given a fine.	This was a lot better than the first one, probably because all of the introductions had been completed and it was time to send Asterix and Obelix on an adventure. However, this adventure has lots of little twists in it as they try to bust open a sickle smuggling racket, who's leadership goes right up to the top in Lutetia. Obviously we also see Obelix with his addiction to wild boar, though I note that Dogmatix, Obelix's dog, doesn't appear in these early albums (despite a write up at the front for him).	I guess I did really enjoy this one, especially since it seems to be a lot more over the top than Tintin. Tintin is comical but more of an adventure story, however while Asterix has its fair share of adventure, it is a lot more comical, and even to an extent farcical. It has been suggested that the writers are using Roman Gaul as a way to make critical comment on our society, however I am not convinced that there is necessarily a much social criticism in these albums as there was in Tintin. However, as I begin to read more of them, we will come to see whether or not that is the case.",11,5
122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,Kavita,752,361,4,"January 13, 2020","The second book of the series, this is the first one in which Asterix and Obelix have an adventure together. Getafix breaks his golden sickle just before the annual druid's conference. Asterix and Obelix offer to go to Lutetia to buy him another one so that he could cut the mistletoe properly for his potions. Once they reach Lutetia, they discover a gang of sickle smugglers operating a black market. Mayhem ensues as our intrepid Gauls take on bandits, wolves, Romans and black-marketeers. Favourite joke: ""Amphora-neck"" in Lutetia (referring to traffic bottlenecks).",10,N/A
122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,Dirk Grobbelaar,550,1045,5,"February 20, 2020","The second Asterix book. Reread.Possibly not quite as funny as Asterix The Gaul, but a much more expansive story-line and improved art. Also debuts Obelix as a main character (in the previous book he was, like the rest of the cast, relegated to the periphery). I should mention that my reviews could possibly be coloured by nostalgia; I’ve always loved these stories. In this instalment we visit Lutetia (Paris) where Asterix needs to obtain a golden sickle for the druid Getafix. Why a golden sickle, specifically? Because mistletoe does not have magical properties unless a golden sickle is used in the cutting. Side note: the cutting of mistletoe was quite a big thing in Ancient Druidry and Celtic Religion. It’s true (or so they say, and to paraphrase Bill Bailey, “who are they? The Wizards”). In some instances the mistletoe wasn’t allowed to touch the ground upon falling, and a golden sickle was actually used. In other instances, it went hand-in-hand with the sacrificing of bulls, which is thankfully not depicted in the Asterix books.Anyway, after that detour, back to the story. It obviously isn’t going to be a simple thing to pop over to the city for some sickle shopping, since there are 46-pages pages to fill with delightful art, adventure and satire. As it turns out, because of the high demand of golden sickles (druid competitions and all that) Lutetian underworld crooks (precursors to the French Mob?) have clamped down on the sickle trade, and sickles can only be obtained at cutthroat prices. More to the point: they have kidnapped Metallurgix, who is not only the best of the sicklesmiths but also a relative of Obelix. This is not to our heroes’ liking, and they determine to set things straight.Great fun! And great sound effects!",9,N/A
122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,Roxana Chirilă,963,122,5,"July 2, 2018","I grew up reading Asterix and Obelix's adventures - the few volumes I could get, that is. If there's one thing I've always regretted about growing up in a mostly Hungarian town, it's that no Romanian bookshop could survive for long (and I don't speak Hungarian). So I bought the books I could while they were available... if I had money. Or, at other times, people bought me books and made me happy.Asterix and Obelix were probably my favorites, even above Donald Duck. I loved the puns, even if I didn't get all of them, I loved the characters, the stories, the world, the details. I'll probably never be able to reread the comics without nostalgia glasses on.In this particular volume, the druid breaks his golden sickle and it's up to Asterix and Obelix to go to Lutetia (ancient Paris) and get a replacement - but of course, things aren't quite that simple. The sickle-maker has vanished, and there's something fishy going on. Will punny names let us readers know who the bad guys are? Will Asterix and Obelix fix it with a bit of sleuthing and a few fist fights? Will the Romans be exasperated by the two Gauls? To all of those, the answer is ""yes"".",7,N/A

122439,Asterix and the Golden Sickle,Vigneswara Prabhu,303,31,4,"May 14, 2022","Getafix's golden sickle is broken, without which he cannot get the ingredients to brew the potion of Invincibility. So Asterix & Obelisk go to Lutetia to meet the blacksmith Metallurgix (of course he is!) to get a replacement. But what awaits them in the big city is an underground crime ring monopolizing all the golden sickles in the market, and keeping Metallurgix captive. Will our heroes find the blacksmith, will they thwart the nefarious schemes of the criminals, will they get back safe, on this week of As-te-rix. But seriously, what is with the world building in this series. It's all tongue in cheek, 'romanized' (get it) satirized versions of the present day; Be is reckless chariot drivers on the slippery cobblestone roads, or 'Ampoule' necks caused by high traffic, or Asterix sneering at the 'modern' Roman constructions of the new generation. Something quaint and jesting about the whole thing.
