118944,American Born Chinese,karen,"3,968",17000,4,"November 10, 2021","this book is the perfect antidote to the ""graphic novels aren't real books"" crowd's poison. it takes full advantage of the medium (lgm with the local boy scout troops), and just runs with it. this story could not have been told as well or as broadly using a more traditional narrative structure. and at the end, there is a perfect collapse - the three storylines streamline so perfectly into one message about cultural acclimatization and race-shame and why it is bad. but not in a preachy way. it is not rah-rah asia, it is just quietly, ""don't be an asshole; this is who you are."" so it doesn't exclude roundeye from appreciating the message, like me at chinese new year at my ex's. I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT ME, GRANDMA TSUI!so the stories include the traditional tale of the monkey king:a very tasteful depiction of a chinese gentleman come to america:and this cute young chinese-american boy with a perm:that's what the art looks like. and if i didn't have to read this for class, i would have missed out on it, because it is not the kind of art i am immediately drawn to. me and art, we don't understand each other. museums leave me cold, and with graphic novels, i am always drawn to certain ones and repulsed by others with not one whit of rhyme nor reason nor consistency. i am the worst at art-appreciation. but i am the queen of making thanksgiving dinner. and writing drunken book reviews. and white trash fixing of silverware drawers:recognize!!!but yeah, a totally charming book. i have no personal immigrant experience from which to draw as a way of relating to this story, but it works on any level of ""appreciate thyself and don't wear shoes just because the humans are doing it"" kind of thing.where did that wine go?come to my blog!

118944,American Born Chinese,Nat,542,3171,5,"August 2, 2018","I started reading this in the middle of the night because when you can’t fall asleep after a certain hour, you surrender and pick up a book.And for once in my life I was pretty happy about being awake in the early morning hours because I realized rather quickly that American Born Chinese is one of the best graphic novels I've read so far.
  
This review contains *spoilers*.All Jin Wang wants is to fit in. When his family moves to a new neighborhood, he suddenly finds that he's the only Chinese American student at his school. Jocks and bullies pick on him constantly, and he has hardly any friends. Then, to make matters worse, he falls in love with an all-American girl...The writer captured the feelings of having a crush so damn perfectly. It was like someone was reading my mind.
  
It perfectly captured the essence of it.And along the way, we smoothly follow the story of the Monkey King:
  
Born to rule over all the monkeys in the world, the story of the Monkey King is one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables. Adored by his subjects, master of the arts of kung-fu, he is the most powerful monkey on earth. But the Monkey King doesn't want to be a monkey. He wants to be hailed as a god...
  
Chin-Kee is the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, and he's ruining his cousin Danny's life. Danny's a popular kid at school, but every year Chin-Kee comes to visit, and every year Danny has to transfer to a new school to escape the shame. This year, though, things quickly go from bad to worse...I kept thinking throughout my reading experience how Danny was going to be relevant in any way. I didn't know if we’re supposed to feel sorry for him… because I certainly didn't. He kept acting like an entitled white boy with little to no problems. 
  
Entitled white boy or what??But then.Then the three stories get connected and it completely knocked my socks off. Because it seemingly follows three unrelated tales until it all comes together for an epic - truly epic - twist that I didn't see coming from a mile off.It was pure brilliance.
  
I was all, NOW WAIT JUST A DAMN MINUTE.....
  
Literally applauding Gene Luen Yang for this reveal that I did not see coming at all!!And here's a pretty accurate visual of me when the reveal came:
  
I was shaking.And praising the writer even more for that ending and how intricate and well-plotted everything was thought out to the last detail. I seriously cannot stop thinking about everything that went down. There's so much to discuss: from white privilege to stereotypes to what it means to accept yourself... And everything was handled with brilliance.P.S. Wei-Chen is one of the best!!!
  

  

  
It's really been such a long time since a graphic novel has captured my heart like this. I read American Born Chinese in one breath and now I cannot stop raving about it. *Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

118944,American Born Chinese,Michael,274,746,4,"January 13, 2011","I wrote a poem many years ago about wishing I was black so I could have an afro. How do you beat afros as a hairstyle? About the only way is by having afro puffs, which white dudes also can't have. Partially because they are white, and partially because they're dudes. I used to skip over that page of job applications that asks your ethnicity. I thought it was stupid that anyone would care what my race, or my sex, was before deciding whether or not to hire me. Hahahah, I was soooo naive!Since then, I've realized to what a great extent the law attempts to make that pesky All men are created equal clause actually true. I've also read some statistics that make it pretty clear those laws aren't getting the job done. Racism, sexism, ableism, sexualpreferenceism, attractivenessism, sizism, there are a fuckton of isms that people still engage in. They aren't conscious of doing them, but they have a sense that the slightly heavier, balding guy my own age isn't going to be as much of a go-getter as me, so they hire me. If he's also black, well FUCK! The job is as good as mine. I believe in the idea of race even less than I used to. But, I have an awful confession to make. I now fill out that page of the application because I now understand that--although it's not technically legal--my whiteness helps me get jobs. Which begs the question, WHY ARE PEOPLE SO FUCKING STUPID?Anyway. [image error]American Born Chinese is the story of an American boy who struggles with the stigma that comes from his Chinese ancestry. He's treated like a second-class citizen, bullied and made fun of. This book also tells the story of Chin-Kee, a Chinese stereotype who comes to live with his white cousin, making the whiteboy's life a living hell as he starts being ostracized by his friends and the girl he has the hots for. This graphic novel is a fast read, yet has a complex story, weaving three tales together that don't unite until the climax. It's my favorite combination of elements in a book: constantly funny, but funny and sad at the same time. The ending was relatively satisfying, and the intricacies of the plots make the book more complex than some novels. This book carries more literary weight than a lot of other books, despite the fact that it's a graphic novel. (I'm still prejudiced against this genre. ""It's perrty good....fer a graphic novel!"") I could use this to launch into yet another political tirade about how instances of ""reverse racism"" are now given a lot more attention in the press than instances of real racism. If anyone really wants that kind of tirade, though, maybe it'll happen in the comments. OOhh, maybe I can attract a troll! I'll try a little bit harder to do so: REVERSE RACISM IS A TERM MADE UP BY RACISTS WHO ARE SICK OF BEING TREATED LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. I have a headache. Oh, and by the way, Goodreads.com, I'm about to plunge back into another semester, so I may not be around much at all, other than when I'm on here experimenting with you guys. But, I will be thinking of you longingly, and I look forward to the time when we can again be together for more than a quick trist. And I'm also looking forward to those trists. Adieu. ",56,6
118944,American Born Chinese,Thomas,"1,399",8120,3,"September 7, 2015","A graphic novel with a wonderful overarching message about identity and a solid representation of Asian-American characters. In American Born Chinese, Gene Luen Yang details the story of Jin Wang, the only Chinese-American at his new school. Yang intertwines Jin's struggle with the tale of Chin-Kee (say this name aloud), the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, as well as the legend of the Monkey King, one of the most famous Chinese fables. These three plots come together in an unexpected way to conclude the novel with a bang.Yang does a great job of deconstructing stereotypes about Asian-Americans by tackling them head on. He delves into Wang's emotions and his vulnerability as an insecure outsider when compared to his peers. He highlights the pressures to assimilate to the predominate culture, even at the cost of one's individuality. Though I found the twist at the end of the book abrupt and a bit too absurd, I appreciated how Yang kept the focus on the intricacies of Asian-American identity in a humorous, accessible way.Recommended to those interested in graphic novels or stories featuring diverse characters. A three star read I would still encourage others to check out, in particular to those searching for something different and fun. ",56,2
118944,American Born Chinese,Reading_ Tamishly,"3,930",2159,1,"February 2, 2020",I hate this one with all my being. Read upto 49 pages. Do not want to waste my time anymore. Too racist and REALLY TRYING MY PATIENCE! BORING AS HELL. Art is below average.,38,18
118944,American Born Chinese,Jessica Abarquez,12,28,5,"April 14, 2008","Reference information: Title: American Born ChineseAuthor: Gene Luen YangPublisher: First Second	Year: 2006# of pages: 233	Genre: Graphic NovelReading level: 6th grade	Interest level: 15 yrs oldPotential hot lava: some racist language, some violenceGeneral response/reaction:I was surprised at how quickly I finished this graphic novel. This book was so easy to read (probably because it was a graphic novel). When I read the inside flap for the plot of the book, I was surprised to read that there were three different stories going on. Then the flap said that all three of those stories would converge and I was even more interested. I enjoyed the stories because it definitely showed the identity crisis that many minorities feel in the United States. While many people would like to think that those minority stereotypes disappeared a long time ago, this book was published in 2006 and absolutely shows that those stereotypes still exist. Subjects, Themes, and Big Ideas:•	Identity•	Racism•	Friendship•	AcceptanceCharacters:•	The Monkey King: He is a king, born in an unorthodox manner, and he wants to be hailed as a deity. He practices kung fu and the different ways to become immortal, but in the process, he loses his identity. As his punishment, the Monkey King is buried under a rock mountain.•	Jin Wang: He was born in American and barely had any friends when he moved from Chinatown in San Francisco to another part of California. He soon made friends with a boy from Taiwan and falls for an American girl. Eventually, things go bad for Jin and he wishes to be someone else.•	Wei-Chen Sun: A boy who moved from Taiwan. He becomes best friends with Jin Wang and dates the only other Asian in the class, Suzy Nakamura.•	Danny: A boy who has transferred to his third high school. He finally finds his niche in school by making the basketball team and talking to girls. Unfortunately, his crazy cousin, Chin-Kee comes to visit and ruins everything. However, Danny turns out to be someone else.•	Chin-Kee: Danny’s cousin who comes to visit once a year. He draws such attention to himself and embarrasses Danny so much that Danny has to transfer schools. Chin-Kee turns out to be more than just Danny’s cousin.Plot summary:The Monkey King wants to be hailed as a deity but the gods will not allow it. He then practices different ways to become immortal and when he achieves it, he challenges the Creator himself. However, the Creator is not happy with the Monkey King’s disrespect and buries the Monkey King under a mountain of rocks for 500 years.Jin Wang is a Chinese-American kid who doesn’t feel like he fits in anywhere. He thinks school is boring until he falls in love with an American girl. That relationship doesn’t work out and he takes his frustrations out on his other two Asian friends. Jin Wang wants to become someone else and he soon gets his wish and transforms into another person.Danny is an American boy who has transferred to three different schools in the past few years. The reason for the transfers is because his cousin Chin-Kee visits every year and the embarrassment from those visits follow him everywhere. Danny finally has enough of the antics and confronts Chin-Kee.Although these three stories seem to have nothing in common, they flow together in the end. The Monkey King is taken on a quest with a monk to help mankind. The Monkey King’s son wanted to live among the humans and became best friends with Jin Wang. When Jin hurt Wei-Chen’s feelings, Wei-Chen turns his back on serving the humans and decides to live as a human for his own gain. Jin transforms into Danny and lives his life in another form. When Danny confronts Chin-Kee, his cousin fights back and then reveals himself to be the Monkey King. Since the Monkey King learned to accept his true form, he tells Danny to accept his true from as Jin Wang. The Monkey King explains everything to Jin. Then he explains that his son did not want to see him anymore, so the Monkey King started visiting Jin to always remind him of where he came from and what his culture is.Strengths (including reviews and awards):•	It is a different kind of book (graphic novel)•	It shows a minority’s perspective•	Winner of the Michael L.

118944,American Born Chinese,Ariel,301,64200,5,"August 31, 2014","SO FLIPPING GOOD! Quite a quirky book, but it benefits from it. It does it's own thing and completely does it well. The themes were powerful and well delivered: I loved seeing the three different stories comment on racism, but more than that, self acceptance.The art wasn't /necessarily/ outstanding, in the terms that I didn't find myself ogling over the illustrations. BUT, it was perfect for this story. It was wonderful! I liked it! Don't get me wrong! The monkey pictures were so cute!I'll definitely be reading more by this author!",31,3
118944,American Born Chinese,Ideas are bulletproof ,106,61,3,"August 18, 2021","An incredibly captivating graphic novel! But I personally don't recommend it to anyone....All you need to know before diving in is that it creates awareness about self appreciation and accepting yourself for who you truly are.The illustrations were mediocre, the back story however was pretty engrossing and philosophical. The message it put across was expressed in a perspicuous way. I would have rated it higher but the plot didn't really 'wow' me. ""It's easy to become anything you wish so long as you're willing to forfeit your soul.""",30,N/A
118944,American Born Chinese,Xueting,262,121,4,"July 26, 2015","One thing that stood out most is that the author focused on exploring the inner self-conscious shame of the immigrant or non-Western, instead of making his main characters perfect, full of mature pride for his identity. In fact, the students around Jin Wang and Wei Chen were portrayed pretty realistically too - some of them were disgusting bullies seeing only one stereotypical image of the Asian, some were more subtly bigoted, and some others don't treat them any different. Although I'm Asian, not an Asian-American, I believe this kind of more complex identities are the real thing everywhere, so I really like how the author told his story this way.Oh, and the twist in how the three stories connect? WOW THAT WAS COOL.",27,2
118944,American Born Chinese,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,5,"September 20, 2011","""American Born Chinese"" has three stories combined into one: the story of the Monkey King and his fight for acceptance among the pantheon of Gods; a lewd Western caricature of Chinese people called Chin-Kee; and at its heart the coming of age story of Jin, a young Chinese boy growing up in America. The story is drawn in a cartoony/Manga type style and coloured by Lark Pien. The overall effect is a very attractive comic. The story though is brilliant. There were moments in Jin's story where his life mirrored my own (the girl at the cinema part) and despite the pervading message - accept who you are and be happy - it's neither patronising or overbearing. The three stories become one by the end and it all becomes a bit magical-realism-y but its such a good story told and drawn so well you won't mind. A fantastic read and a great book. ",24,N/A
118944,American Born Chinese,David,644,293,5,"February 8, 2016",Man this hit me in the feels. This would have been a momentous book for me as a pre-teen. I totally identified with Jin Wang and in him recognized the need to fit in as a second generation Asian surrounded by a majority of white peers and the undercurrent of Asian stereotypes that still bubbled to the surface from Long Duk Dong to William Hung. It is a coming of age story that explores this overwhelming need to fit in while wresting with a larger cultural identity. It works absolutely perfectly as a graphic novel and manages to say so much in such a short and simple way. Loved it.,24,1 comment
118944,American Born Chinese,Erin,"2,815",494,3,"September 14, 2019","The second book in my classroom book box, this graphic novel quickly captured my attention as it tackled many Asian stereotypes.

118944,American Born Chinese,Shay,310,38,4,"March 3, 2022","Even though I'm not an American Born Chinese, I think everyone can relate to this book. You'll relate if you've ever felt the need to change something about yourself to fit in, whether it's the fact that you're not white, or in my case -- other insecurities. Those little insecurities that separate you from other people but make you beautiful and distinct.I really loved this book. The only reason I denote a star is because the ending felt very rushed.",22,1 comment
