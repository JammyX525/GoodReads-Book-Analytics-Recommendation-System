There's something about this particular book that really makes me laugh. I love all of the clever humor, and I love the comics about the Snow Goons. There is some fantastic material in this collection, and I can't recommend it enough. ",15,N/A

'Calvin and Hobbes' are the best comics I have ever read. If I wasn't planning on cremation, I would ask to be buried with a 'Calvin and Hobbes' book. (Second choice would be 'Doonesbury'.)",10,2

My personal highlight was the: ""Hobbes, do you think our morality is defined by our actions, or by what's in our hearts?I think our actions SHOW what's in our hearts.""Calvin stops, thinks. ""I RESENT THAT!"" :D :D ",6,1 comment
70487,Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons,Becky,827,157,5,"March 8, 2012","	I don’t know if a family, much less a childhood, without Calvin and Hobbes would be complete. Frankly, once it stopped being published, my newspaper readership dropped off significantly. Everyone needs to smile, needs a little imagination in their life, and needs a little bit of Calvin and Hobbes.	And if anyone is up for a game of Calvinball, just give me a call.",5,N/A

70487,Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons,PurplyCookie,942,201,5,"November 19, 2009","Calvin is an academic underachiever, rebel, performance artist, disgruntled philosopher, and all-around bringer of chaos--although his playmate/rival Susie refers to him as ""the incurable weirdness poster child."" Whether discovering a new dinosaur species (the ""Calvinosaurus"") or evading the dreaded monster under the bed, Calvin is hilarious. ""Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons"" refers to one of these story lines in which Calvin creates a mutant snow man which in turn creates an army of similar creatures. Other story lines involve Calvin getting chicken pox; his creation of his own TV show; and his club known as GROSS (a warped acronym for ""Get Rid Of Slimy girlS""). Last but not least, Calvin builds a human duplicating machine out of a cardboard box, and he makes a special copy of himself that represents everything good in him. His plan is to make his flawless duplicate do all of his homework and chores, while he himself gets all the credit. Everything goes fine for a while, until his duplicate develops a crush on Suzie, making him look bad. Hilarity ensues. The Calvin and Hobbes stories are great because they are funny celebrations of the power of a child's imagination. Calvin assumes such alternate identities as sci-fi hero Spaceman Spiff, caped superhero Stupendous Man, and private eye Tracer Bullet. Often the humor comes from the clash of Calvin's fantasies with the reality around him. The stuffed Hobbes, through the power of Calvin's imagination, becomes both a comrade and a great foil for the boy; their wacky relationship is one of the most memorable in the comic strip genre.I guarantee that anyone that loves comics will fall in love with this one and should definitely buy this book to start their collection of classic comics. Best comic ever in my opinion. Book Details: Title Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow GoonsAuthor Bill Watterson Reviewed By Purplycookie",3,8
70487,Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons,Thomas Scholtes,103,2,5,"December 9, 2020","A cartoon strip that makes you laugh, makes you wonder, makes you reminisce, makes you cry...Calvin & Hobbes is just pure joy. Some strips don't even need words, others have entire monologues scrawled onto 3 or 4 tiny boxes, and yet all of them capture your attention and leave you feeling better than before. Just quality work through and through.",3,N/A
70487,Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons,Kent,224,5,5,"June 10, 2020","The best comic strip ever written, in my humble opinion, with The Far Side and Peanuts not far behind. Calvin battles his parents, his teacher, the doctor, the monsters under the bed, the snow goons, his neighbor Susie, and sometimes Hobbes. He also sometimes battles himself, like when he remembers that Santa is watching; and even his ethicator-enhanced duplicator-created always-good duplicate when said duplicate is too kind to Susie Derkins. Friendship, mischief, imagination, and lots of fun.This was at least my 2nd time through this book.",2,N/A
70487,Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons,Brian,671,313,4,"February 19, 2016","“Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons” is a delightful Calvin and Hobbes collection with lots of strips and storylines that focus on winter activities. There are quite a few of the famous philosophical sled rides with Calvin and Hobbes careening down dangerous hills while pondering some of the most significant aspects of our daily lives.Also included in this collection were the strips featuring Calvin being “attacked” by his bike, coincidently while he is learning to ride it. Some favorite storylines also reappear, including the the second appearance of Calvin’s duplicator machine, and a storyline featuring Calvin’s caustic film noir private eye.“Attack of the Deranged Mutant Killer Monster Snow Goons” is perfect reading while a snowstorm rages outside.As usual with a Calvin and Hobbes collection I found myself laughing and thinking at the same time. I enjoy when that happens! I can always count on Calvin and Hobbes to make me laugh, and to tease my brain cells a little. I love them, and these collections, for that!",2,N/A
