107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Anne,"3,784",6900,3,"January 24, 2020","Finally! I've been wanting to read this one forever, but I've never been able to find it anywhere (free). But Amazon has kindly included it in their Prime reading section, so I snatched it up and here we are.Ok, while I did know the basic gist of the story, there were several surprises in here that made it well worth reading, especially since I'm a big fan of Red Hood.Readers actually paid (50 cents) to kill off Jason Todd!Wow. The hatered was real.I knew they voted him off, I just didn't realize they had to fork over money for the privilege. Ok, well more likely, they had to ask their parents if they would let them call a 900 number. But I remember landline phones, long-distance telephone numbers, and how parents felt about paying for calls they didn't make. Kids today have no idea how brutal the dark ages were.Plus, there was such a small window of time to make the call to save/kill The Toddster.Dedication, thy name is Comic Fan.Although, after reading this, I can see why Jason lost his little cartoon life. The kid was annoying.Still...ouch.  I think most people will agree that the crowbar has become a pretty iconic part of Red Hood's origin story. But what's been forgotten was the last few panels of that page. You know, the part where it was actually his fucking birth-mother who turned him over to the Joker.Holy Twat Tacos, Batman!  Ok, Batman notices that Jason is a bit out of control, so he attempts to bench him and get him some help. Jason simultaneously tells Bruce to piss off and begins an ill-fated search for this real mother. <--these things rarely end wellMeanwhile, Batman goes off in search of Joker, who is attempting to sell weapons to some bad guys in the Middle East. At some point, the two meet, team up, and discover which one of Jason's Maybe Moms is the one who pushed him out of her womb. Oh, Jason.Another surprise (for me) was that Joker blackmailed his mother (Dr. Shelia Haywood) into turning Jason over to him with the threat of exposing her part in an illegal abortion that caused the death of a teenage girl. The fact that she was painted as evil for performing abortions seemed really weird and dated to me. I mean, she was also embezzling from the refugee camp she was working in, but even that doesn't seem like the level of villainy needed to have a smoke while your son is getting beaten to death by a psycho. Robin's Mom & her actions were off-putting and strange, and I actually agree with the subsequent writers who decided to gloss over that whole part of the story. Good riddance to Dr. Haywood.The big questions of the day were, of course, whether or not Batman shows up in time to save Jason, or whether or not Jason survives the bomb going off. Well, we all know how it turned out.R.I.P., Jason Todd - world's douchiest Robin.2006 - Enter Winnick's Under the Red Hood & one of DC's best anti-heroes.Another thing I loved was the alternate ending panel. Batman is smiling?! That's worth the price of admission, right there. But wait! There's more!I'm sure you're all wondering why the hell Batman didn't just go after the Joker and kill the fuck out of him. Right?Welcome to the second part of this wacko story:The old diplomatic immunity trope.Superman (ever the government stooge) stops Bruce from going after Iran's newest ambassador.I can't even...Anyhoo.The truth is that I thought the story itself was kind of stupid, and it doesn't really hold up over the years - if it ever did. Just sort of felt slapped together and weird. But it's become a linchpin in not only Red Hood's origin story but Batman's, as well. Yeah, it's dumb, but you really need to see this shit for yourself.Required Reading for Batfans.PS- In the edition I had, it included a whole bunch of issues that had the introduction of Tim Drake and (maybe) some other stuff. I was struggling to finish the main story, so this was a definite no-go for me. I skimmed it and I skipped it. But for those of you who are interested..?",140,45
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Kemper,"1,388",6647,3,"April 10, 2011","Treasure of the Rubbermaids 8: Dial 1-900 For MurderThe on-going discoveries of priceless books and comics found in a stack of Rubbermaid containers previously stored and forgotten at my parent’s house and untouched for almost 20 years. Thanks to my father dumping them back on me, I now spend my spare time unearthing lost treasures from their plastic depths. The Robin character is something that has been a problem for Batman stories since comics ‘matured’. As Batman was turned into an increasingly grim and psychologically haunted character by various writers also trying to make him more grounded and realistic, the idea that this dark vigilante would have a young sidekick dressed up in bright colors and cracking jokes was increasingly out of sync with the tone of the comics. Plus, what kind of grown man dresses up a young boy in green short-shorts and a yellow cape?(And I’ve always had a hard time buying the notion that no one in Gotham City would figure out who Batman is just by the presence of a Robin. Billionaire Bruce Wayne with the murdered parents adopted a young kid whose parents are also murdered, and now Batman is running around with a young man? What a coincidence!)Original Robin Dick Grayson had broken away from Batman and become a new hero, Nightwing. Batman found his replacement in Jason Todd, a young orphan and juvenile delinquent. However, in 1988 shortly after ultra-violent and dark comics The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke came out and with a big budget Tim Burton movie in the works that featured no Robin, the idea of having an increasingly edgy Batman work with a kid seemed just stupid. Plus, comic fans had never embraced the Jason Todd character even after one of DC’s many continuity reboots revamped his origin story.So DC cooked up a scheme to put Jason Todd in a hairy predicament, and then let fans call a 1-900 number to vote on if he should live or die. It got a lot of attention from the media, and over 10,000 people spent 50 cents to have a say in Robin’s fate. It was close but the kid got the death penalty. The story is pretty powerful for Batman fans, but there’s a lot of problems with it. There’s way too many coincidences with Jason searching for his long lost mother and just happening to end up the Middle East as Batman has trailed the Joker and a hijacked nuclear missile there. Then the Joker has an old connection to Jason’s mom and tries to blackmail her just as Jason finds her in Ethiopia. Apparently it’s a small freaking superhero world. Then there’s an international political storyline that introduces Superman, and it all seems too crazy and farfetched, even by the loose standards of comic stories. (I did enjoy some of the dated ‘80s references like the Joker, desperate for cash, complaining that he’s another victim of Reaganomics.)It’s still a disturbing scene to watch the Joker beat Robin relentlessly with a crowbar and then leaving him to be finished off by a bomb blast. The splash panel with Batman carrying Robin’s body out of the rubble is a classic. But if they wanted to kill off Robin, they should have done it in Gotham and not in Africa during a pretty standard crazy-Joker- is-selling-nukes-to-terrorists storyline.Also, DC really screwed the pooch on the secret identity issue here. The Joker knows Jason Todd is Robin by the time he kills him. Later he gets into a stare-off with Bruce Wayne in public. So he‘s gotta know that Bruce is Batman, right? Uh, not sure, and it was never addressed later that I’m aware of. Plus, there’s an issue with no one in Gotham realizing that Bruce Wayne’s ward was killed in mysterious circumstances and suddenly Batman doesn’t have a Robin. No one could work that out?So this is a groundbreaking comic in a lot of ways, but not a particularly great one other than the actual death of Robin. This also started the ugly trend of comic companies stunt killing characters for publicity. Usually, they bring them back shortly after that, but for a long time it seemed like Jason Todd would actually stay dead. Unfortunately, DC finally gave in and brought back Jason as an unhinged villain recently. Too bad because the death of Jason Todd was an event that had hung over the Batman stories and gave them a real sense of loss and consequences.However, I did get a good laugh when I dug out this collection from 1989 and saw this blurb from legendary DC writer/editor Denny O’Neil on the back cover: “It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.”Oops.

107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Mizuki,"2,903",1155,4,"May 30, 2019","""Gayness"" he said, ""is built into Batman. I'm not using gay in the pejorative sense, but Batman is very, very gay. There's just no denying it. Obviously as a fictional character he's intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that's why people like it. All these women fancy him. He doesn't care—he's more interested in hanging out with the old guy and the kid.""-Grant Morrison on Batman (quote took from The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture pg. 277)Before we talk about how good this comic is, can we stop for a second to talk about Batman's gayness first?If Bruce Wayne/Batman's relationship with Dick Garyson/the first Robin is enough to raise eyebrows, then I just can't get over how...gay Bruce Wayne's relationship with Jason Todd/the second Robin is!Okay, okay. I'm not saying the two are in a secret relationship or Bruce wants to bed the younger man......but just looks at how these two interact in A Death in the Family! Can't you just see the homoeroticism oozing out from the pages!?Aside from the gay issues, we just have to talk about how Batman is a horrible mentor. Not only he invited a troubled teenager to the dangerous life of crime-fighting---AND that alone is horrible enough a mistake! You don't get underage teens to fight crime! No sane person would do that! I mean, Dick has the explanation of wanting to avenge his parents, but Jason.......I just can't find any reason for him! Plus Bruce really, really didn't know much about how to help said troubled teenager to work out his issues! Okay, Batman later regrets his bad decisions with Jason, but hey! The damage is already done.As to the setting, I am not a fan of sending Batman outside of Gotham city and let him wander off to the Middle East to fight crime/terrorism, I mean the Bat fighting crime under the broad daylight of the Middle East is...totally wrong for me. Still, the 'Jason searching for his mother' storyline works out okay for me......so I guess the likes and dislikes break even here?Thirdly, the artwork is hopelessly outdated (the art of comic-drawing had came a long way since the 1980s!) and I'm also not a fan of the artist's style, yet the artwork works finely enough for me, I have no complaint.What I really do appreciate, is the aftermath of Jason's death, how shortly after murdering Jason and his mother, the Joker became the Iran's ambassador so Batman and Co. can't touch him without creating an international crisis and how the Joker goes on to prepare a speech in the UN,  and guess what? The Joker's speech is just perfect!PS: but how come the Joker still didn't realize Bruce Wayne is Batman after he found out Jason Todd, Bruce's ward, is Robin!? LOLPSS: We definitely need an Under the Hood live-action movie!!!! Batman v.s. Jason Todd/Red Hood! YEAH!Fun Facts:(1) In this story, Commissioner Gordon knows Batman is Bruce.(2) Batman and Superman look so alike that they can very well be long-lost brothers.

107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Baba,"3,503",725,3,"December 29, 2020","Jim Starlin's late 80s headline grabbing 'death in the Batman family' story, encompassing the search for his real mother; the Joker becoming a UN ambassador(!); and one of the Batman family daring to go it alone against The Joker! I read the comic books Batman #426-429. Lots of Jokerish audacities, lots of hyperbole and a not to bad read, it could have been worse! 6 out of 12",31,N/A
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,2,"November 11, 2012","SPOILERSJoker busts out of Arkham Asylum (the place is useless, really) and heads to the Middle East to sell a cruise missile he's had in storage, and Batman follows to stop him. Meanwhile Jason Todd aka Robin is working through some emotional issues and finds out that the woman he thought was his mother wasn't his biological mother so he sets off to track down his real mum.I know this book is always on peoples' lists of ""must-read"" Batman stories but, besides Jason's death, there really isn't anything particularly good about this story. There are too many coincidences - Jason's search for his mother takes him to Israel, Lebanon, and Ethiopia, to find each of the three women who could potentially be his mum; these places also happen to be where the Joker goes to sell his missile/make money, and of course Batman and Robin cross paths in each instance!Then there's the Joker. First off I hate how he's drawn in the `80s, his face is ridiculously long like an Easter Island sculpture. Second, I hate how his entire motivation in this book is money. I realise the Joker of the 21st century is far cooler, just think of that scene in ""The Dark Knight"" when Heath Ledger's Joker burns an enormous pile of money, but did Jim Starlin have to make his Joker so pathetically hung up on cash? In one scene when Joker's money is destroyed he slinks away in the shadows whining ""My lovely money... whatever will I do now...?"" - so pathetic.And then there are the strange nuances with Batman and Robin. In the middle of a desert Batman and Robin take down Arab guards and don their gear, but they manage to pick the guards that suit their superhero outfits so Batman gets a blue robes and Robin red robes. Then Batman says something about covering a large amount of terrain using something that will make them ""invisible"" - hang-gliders! He reasons that anyone looking at them will think they're birds. Yeah, birds have jets don't they? Robin's outfit too is really stupid. Those bare legs and little green scaly shorts look so daft it's a wonder they got away with it for so long.When Jason dies, Batman gives a summary of his life and gives a lame reason for wanting to have a child as a sidekick fighting criminals at night - ""I guess I was just lonely"". But he vows to ""never again"" allow a minor to help him fight villains as evil as Joker and Two-Face. Right, except right after this he meets Tim Drake and trains him to become the new Robin. Sigh... I don't know why Starlin tried to reason Robin into existence, just accept that it's weird but it is what it is. He's a colourful moving target to draw gunfire away from the guy dressed in black (or blue in this book). Move on.I'll give credit to Starlin for making the death scene very stark and brutal, though the events afterwards that keep Batman from attacking Joker completely negate any of the impact because you're wondering how on earth such nonsense made it into print. The Joker becomes ambassador for Iran, that bugbear of Cold War 1980s America. Yes, ambassador. What absolute rubbish.This is such a bad `80s comic book full of poor dialogue and plotting and that cheesy comic book style of drawing that instantly dates it, that it's amazing it's held in the high regard it is. It's reputation must be held up by aging fanboys who look back on this era with nostalgia and ignore the fact that the Batman books of this time (barring a few exceptions) were mostly terrible and can't hope to stand up to the generally high quality of the Batman books being written today. I suppose every Batman fan must read this if only for the mythology aspect of it, but it's not even the end of Jason Todd. He comes back in Judd Winick's ""Under the Hood"", so that the book's sombre and dark cover underlines the silliness of superhero comics in general - characters come back all the time, there are never any real endings.Anybody looking for a fun Batman read will not find it here, nor is it a deserved classic; “A Death in the Family” is just a book that happens to have an event in it that some consider to be important but really isn't. Definitely missable, this is ultimately a disappointing read.",29,1 comment
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Shannon,883,217,4,"May 26, 2014","This best selling 1980s graphic novel let the readers decide if the second Robin, Jason Todd, would live or die after an explosion. In this late 80s graphic novel there's an actual copy of the advertisement and the 900 number to call to decide upon the fate of the Boy Wonder. The fans decided they didn't like Jason Todd much and voted to kill him and no that isn't a spoiler based on the title and cover. Apparently the vote was close. Over 10,000 votes were cast, with the final vote being 5,343 votes for Jason to die over 5,271 for him to live  (Wiki). There is a copy of the cover which shows Jason Todd surviving (in case the fans voted for him to live). The story in of itself ranges from very good to questionable. I don't want to give spoilers but some felt the Joker to Africa connection was too coincidental and others didn't like the Joker and Iran connection though back in those days I think there was a lot of hostility towards possible Middle Eastern terrorists and look what happened during 9-11 so maybe it's not so farfetched or maybe it still is? Additionally, the graphic novel covered issues that concerned the country/world at the time: the IRA, Reaganomics, the Lebanese War, nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, Iran, rogue states, the famine in Ethiopia, Iran-Contra affair and much more.After the death of Robin II you get to see the Batman going down the wrong road even though his friends try to guide him back to the light (he even punches Superman surprisingly). It isn't really until Tim Drake (the future Robin III obviously) takes action on his own and brings Dick Grayson, the first Robin who is now Nightwing, to his senses that Batman begins to recover. For those not in the know Robin serves as a reminder of who Batman/Bruce Wayne used to be before his parents were horribly murdered before his eyes.The artwork is traditionally classic with a distinctive almost bright blue coloring to Batman (which makes it really hard to believe he can surprise people in the desert by sneaking around) which I haven't seen in a while. Also, emoting obvious emotions is more prevalent than in later comics.IGN comics ranked this as #15 on the top 25 Batman graphic novels. At the time this was presented the killing of superhero characters was a new thing. These days they die and then come back with the old bait and switch or when writers want to look for some reason to bring them back. Denny O'Neil, editor of the Bat-comics at the time of Todd's death, stated on the back cover of A Death in the Family trade paperback: ""It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back."" However, O'Neil would later regret his decision. Uh huh.  This is a must read for Batman fans simply for its history. Get it.  ARTWORK PRESENTATION: B; BATMAN MYTHOLOGY/FRESHNESS: A minus (for its time); STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; WHEN READ: June to July 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.

107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Delirious Disquisitions,428,179,2,"July 17, 2018","You should read this if you like: retro Batman, Batman & Robin, classic comics, Joker, Dick Greyson, Tim Drake, Batman/Robin dynamic. I know this is a classic but some elements of this story just feel so outdated. Jason Todd's death happens with some drama but since it was to be expected it didn't really pack much of a punch. As someone who would have totally voted yes to put an end to his annoying character I am glad we finally got him out of the picture. His death, though, is significant if only for the shift in Joker/ Batman dynamic, and for what his loss means for the Bat family and the events to follow. In case of the latter, I wish we had explored the physiological effects of Todd's loss on Batman and how that changes him in future comics. I liked the introduction to Tim drake, my favorite Robin after Dick Grayson. Tim is a vast improvement over Todd. In addition to his intelligence, his maturity in understanding the symbolism of the Batman and Robin duo was particularly striking. It will be interesting to see if and how his ideology of Justice might change over time. I also enjoyed the glimpses of the Nightwing/Batman dynamic and their parallels into their father/son relationship. Theirs has always been one of my most favorite pairings and I'm glad we saw some of that in this comic. For these reasons alone, this comic stands out as one of more significant turning points in Batman comic history. I wish I could have enjoyed the storytelling more.",13,N/A
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Ｆｒａｎｋｈ,845,157,4,"July 9, 2015","I first knew about Jason Todd through the story 
  Under the Hood
 written by Judd Winick which turned out to be his resurrection story. I watched the animation film with Supernatural's Jensen Ackles as Todd's voice actor and then I read the collected edition a few months after. To explain briefly, Jason Todd was the second Robin who succeeded Dick Grayson shortly after the latter quit and then joined the Teen Titans instead. Bruce Wayne first met Jason in the infamous Crime Alley when he was on patrol as Batman and he found the boy dismantling his batmobile to steal his gears which understandably annoyed Bruce but he nevertheless felt sorry for the boy when he realized that he was an orphan, living off the streets.A part of him also connected strongly to the boy upon discovering that his father was brutally murdered. Determined to help the boy and because he needed a partner, Bruce then recruited Jason and started training him to become the new Robin. Jason was a fast learner but he was highly temperamental and definitely have anger and ego issues. He is impulsive when it comes to handling criminals, often driven by rage during fights. Still, Bruce thought it will pass. Later on, Bruce realized that it was the villain Two Face who murdered Jason's father. Upon confrontation, Jason opted not to kill Two Face which made Bruce proud but he would soon see that the boy is far damaged than he could ever anticipated.In A Death in the Family, we explore the extent of Jason Todd's emotional issues and the strained relationship he has with Bruce. The idea of killing the second Robin sprang from the publication's marketing move where readers themselves were asked through survey as to whether or not they still want Jason around as Batman's partner. Surprisingly enough, the people voted for Jason's death so DC had writer Jim Starlin conceptualize and deliver the story. I suppose many readers are just not too fond of Jason and may also think he is not as likable as Dick Grayson whom Bruce had a better chemistry and rapport with.The story itself was composed of issues Batman #426-429 and it was a compelling closer look at Jason Todd's final moments leading to his death in the hands of no other than the Joker. This was published in 1988 which was also around the time when the entire Batman line-up of stories for DC took on a grittier tone. The narrative for A Death in the Family was straightforward and serious enough as it explored the growing distance between Bruce and Jason as Bruce decided that Jason needs to take a sabbatical from crime-fighting as Robin. Bruce does not exactly have the parenting skills to make Jason understand his point of view and have the boy open up to him. Since Jason also refuses to talk about it, he became further withdrawn and completely shuts out Bruce from there on.One day, as he was walking around his old neighborhood reminiscing about the happy past with his parents, a friend of his mother called to him and gave him his old stuff from his previous home. This is where Jason found out a shocking truth: that the woman who raised him was just his stepmother and his biological mother is alive and still out there. Aided only by three names in his father's notebook of contacts, he researched the three possible women who could be his missing mother. Naturally, he didn't ask for Bruce's help as he boarded a plane to go to his destination. Meanwhile, the Joker is loose and is looking for a way to finance his criminal activities so he basically decided to get into international terrorism. Batman has to stop him and coincidentally, both the Joker and Jason are heading for the same place.What follows is a series of more convenient coincidences where each of the three women have some thin connection to the Joker's schemes if not entirely related to it. It became unavoidable for Bruce and Jason to meet and Bruce had no other choice but to help Jason alongside trying to apprehend the Joker with his latest nefarious schemes. It has to be said that it's pretty grim and humorous at the same time that the candidates for Jason's biological mother are a spy, a mercenary and a volunteer doctor for a relief expedition (the last one is the only optimistic choice).I liked this story. It was an important installment concerning a character who eventually becomes a fan-favorite once he grew out of his Robin costume and became his own brand of vigilante. I have an ongoing love-hate relationship with Jason Todd. I softened on him only quite recently. A Death in the Family was the first time we see a Robin die and where Bruce has to grieve over the loss his partner. I thought the story was enjoyable although everything felt like a set-up especially the coincidences where the Joker is tied with the search for Jason's missing mother so it easy for Bruce and Jason to still be Batman and Robin and fight him while having that personal side-mission on the side.Jason's death, I think, was only upsetting because it was an abrupt dramatic irony. He wasn't well-liked by the readers that much and the circumstances leading to his death could have been avoided if only Bruce was perceptive enough to communicate and open himself up to Jason since the boy doesn't even know that Bruce himself had a similar childhood trauma. I think if he was honest from the very start then Jason would have trusted him and listened to him more. But alas, it's not meant to be and Bruce ended up carrying a badly wounded Jason in his arms which became an iconic image in itself.A Death in the Family is a prelude to the more superior follow-up Under the Hood. I suggest you read these two stories back-to-back to really get the sense of the drama, action and conflict that encompasses the entire character arc of Jason Todd when he died as a Robin and was revived as the Red Hood.

107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Chris Gordon,178,9,4,"March 21, 2019","Wow! I am very impressed at how high in quality A Death in the Family turned out to be. I'll be honest, the stigma of this graphic novel being a bit aged and far before my time initially turned me off to the idea that it could be as worthwhile as some of the contemporary graphic novels I've read and enjoyed. I figured, at most, I would get a decent story out of it and not much more. Boy, was I wrong. Batman: A Death in the Family is by and large one of the most enthralling Batman graphic novels I have read thus far, easily toppling The Dark Knight Returns and The Long Halloween by a lot, and those are two heavy-hitters themselves.The writing by Jim Starlin is fantastic and truly allows the story to play out to its fullest potential. It could have been so easy to ruin a story like this by forcing drama or censoring itself to reach greater audiences, but everything seemed to work just right in the grand scheme of things. For an older story, I have to give it a lot of credit for not pulling its punches in order to be more reader-friendly. I mean, just look at how Jason Todd was treated all throughout the story; I never could have fathomed the writers being so utterly ruthless to as campy a character as one of the old-school Robins! Such unforgiving treatment of a character of this importance made Jason Todd's Robin all the more tragic a figure in the Batman mythos, and the story that much more dramatic and entertaining.I equate A Death in the Family with Spider-Man's The Death of Gwen Stacy, for both stories entail the death of a significant character in each respective hero's life, causing a great shift in everything thereafter. However, unlike Spider-Man's story arc, Batman's has much more at play than what can be seen on the surface. For example, the psychology of Batman becomes very important to consider throughout the story, as it helps us to understand why he does what he does, as well as understand how he feels after this tragedy transpires. A Death in the Family inspires further inquiry into questions such as ""Why does Batman put these kids' lives at risk just to have a crime fighting ward at his side?"" and, ""Did Batman ultimately kill Jason Todd, not the Joker, because of his negligence?"" I frequently found myself questioning Batman's mental stability as it related to companionship and loneliness; Batman, for as brilliant as he may be, seems to make the worst decisions when it comes to being a guardian to those he takes in, all for the sake of avoiding loneliness. I'm glad A Death in the Family made me think so deeply about these topics, for it helped me to develop a more profound appreciation for the Batman universe and its characters. Also, how can you not love the Joker's maniacal performance in this graphic novel? To be quite frank, the Joker was much more menacing and interesting in A Death in the Family than he was in the highly regarded and disgustingly overrated The Killing Joke. Whereas the Joker of Alan Moore's piece was whiny, flustered, and failed to prove his point to Batman and thus came away from the whole ordeal a huge loser, the Joker under Starlin's watch was fun, unpredictable, and remained in charge throughout the story, ending up with a victory over Batman in the most meaningful and horrific way possible. That isn't to say that crippling Barbara Gordon in The Killing Joke was a minor event in the DC universe, though I would have to contend that taking the life of your sidekick has to be significantly more demoralizing to Batman's psyche. In short, after looking for a true-to-character Joker performance between several graphic novels, I finally found one worth admiring in A Death in the Family. The only odd point of the whole graphic novel was the latter part when the Joker became a diplomat for the terrorist nation of Iran in order to gain diplomatic immunity from Batman's wrath as well as easy access to a major target for crime. Okay, that's a bit out there, even for one of these old comics, but it didn't hamper the main drama of the storyline. Perhaps its omission would have benefitted the arc overall, but having it there doesn't detract much from the best parts of the story and character development. A Death in the Family far exceeded my expectations and proved to be a must-read Batman tale worthy of its legacy. If there was ever a Joker story that deserved all the praise and acclaim it garners, this would be it, not that miserable The Killing Joke travesty everyone so eagerly trips over themselves to applaud despite being lackluster at best...but I digress. Definitely pick up A Death in the Family if you want to witness a major turning point in Batman's life, but just be sure to follow it up with A Lonely Place of Dying.",7,N/A
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Lashaan Balasingam,"1,323",4621,3,"March 10, 2018","You can find my review on our blog by clicking here.Let’s cut to the chase. If the cover of this trade paperback doesn’t single-handedly give away one of the biggest events in Batman’s history, then something’s wrong. Aside from the fact that Batman : A Death in the Family is considered to be one of the most important reads for comic fans and that the death of a Robin is seldom tragic, this volume was a stunning disappointment. I’ll be frank, I jumped into the volume without prior knowledge of the story to expect or even the additional content introducing the new Robin—yes, my friends, there are more than one Robin’s out there. Oh, don’t give me that look. With all those different costumes and physical disparities compared to the original Robin, you’re going to tell me that the kid behind the mask was always the same? Batman : A Death in the Family jumps directly into an action scene with an emotional and aggressive Robin who later finds out a truth that will change his purpose in life. With the intention of uncovering the details behind this truth, he sets himself on a journey outside of Gotham while Batman tries to stop the Joker from launches a nuclear disaster. Filled with coincidences in a step-by-step adventure, Jim Starling and friends write up a story with one key moment. A death in the family.The main storyline called A Death in the Family is separated in 4 books. Collecting them all into one, this trade paperback also adds a follow-up story to A Death in the Family in order to introduce a new character into the Batman family. Funny thing about this so-called masterpiece is how Robin’s fate was decided by the public. In fact, there was an advertisement that went around to get people to call and vote for Robin to live or die in this story arc. As tight as the votes were, the decision was made and history was changed. The main attraction to this trade paperback is the gruesome death delivered by Batman’s greatest foe. As much as the story was linear and filled with some of the biggest coincidences, the final scenes related to Robin’s death is nonetheless memorable. The sheer cruelty in the violence and the execution of the murder is simply iconic and will forever be remembered.The narration in this volume was absolutely annoying. Personally, I couldn’t stand Batman’s inner voice. It’s crazy how robotic and systematic it was. To top it off, some of his thoughts were simply unrealistic and over-zealous. To put it out plainly, some things are better off left to be deduced. Readers don’t need a narration that spells out the obvious or one that tries to make Batman sound rational from the inside. Let the actions do the talking. Maybe this comes to down to personal taste, but I felt like the writers tried too hard in trying to explicitly indicate Batman’s thought process, desiring an awe-effect from readers. As if Batman’s calculated and split-second decisions should impress readers on the spot. In the end, the direction the narration went only resulted in a funny-talking Batman who’s desire to push away—while still keeping close—the highly emotional and mourning Robin.For a volume that is proclaimed a ground-breaking classic, I was quite dissatisfied by the storyline. I honestly did not expect the story to take place outside of Gotham most of the time, especially not in Middle East and Africa. This made room for a less serious take on the events and a less appealing story where major characters are killed off. The worse part in all this is the last book in the 4 part story arc. With the arrival of another superhero and a ridiculous political twist to the storyline, I was left brain-dead and mouth open. Thankfully, I was able to reconcile myself by admiring the artwork and remembering myself that I’ve just witnessed one of the biggest events in Batman’s universe. Speaking of the artwork, Batman: A Death in the Family has the colorful and classic style of the old comic age. I’ll always be able to appreciate this art, no matter the story. I was actually quite amused by the looks for Robin (them legs, though).To add more flesh to this skeleton, Batman: A Death in the Family also contains a couple of additional single issues that follow up to the events in the main story arc. Essentially, the additional stories added at the end revolves around the arrival of a new Robin and his rise to the mantle of Batman’s side-kick. What’s fun about this story is the panel-time that the New Teen Titans get. Seeing Cyborg, Starfire and even Raven was quite satisfying. Although readers aren’t given the chance to see them kick-ass or use much of their powers, being able to see their design back in the days is fascinating. The story pertains to finding out where Nightwing has disappeared to, while Batman faces Two-Face in a fight that seems to lead him to defeat. In the meantime, an unknown character tries to find and get Nightwing to help a morally destroyed Batman; after all, he lost Robin. The introduction to this Robin is weak, but interesting. It does make me want to learn more about the character, even if the way he got the “job” could be summed up to blackmail. But hey, to each their own way to success!Although this volume was surprisingly disappointing, it still remains an essential to any Batman fan. It sets the foundation to other story arcs that are much more amazing; yep, I’m looking at you Batman : Under The Hood. This trade paperback is bound to put you on an adventure and discover more about Robin and Batman’s relationship. If the full-page panel showing Batman carrying a bleeding and lifeless Robin doesn’t send chills down your spine, we’re going to have to talk about therapy options. Batman: A Death in the Family is definitely worth reading, and you shouldn’t skip the occasion to see Joker’s plan to sell missiles to terrorists, Robin’s bitter fate, Batman’s misery due to the loss of a partner and plenty of other unpredictable surprises.Yours truly,LashaanLashaan & Trang | Bloggers and Book ReviewersOfficial blog: http://bookidote.wordpress.com______________________________If it wasn't for the grand event that makes this story arc a classic, I could definitely knock off a star or two for this trade paperback. The original 4 book story of Death in the Family was such a letdown. From the systematic and robotic narration depicting Batman's rational thoughts to the ridiculous Middle Eastern adventures for Batman and friends, Death in the Family was a overzealous attempt to associate Batman to the ""real"" world; filled with a bunch of forced coincidences, might I add.The additional comics that tie-in to the original Death in the Family story arc reveals Tim Drake's story and, boy, is that a lame one. If I could sum his story, I'd pretty much call it blackmail. At least this volume had some entertainment value!P.S. A full review to come.Yours truly,LashaanLashaan & Trang | Bloggers and Book ReviewersOfficial blog: http://bookidote.wordpress.com",6,3
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Eddie B.,574,2494,4,"October 26, 2022","Maybe because the conclusion of the story is well known or maybe because the art that didn't really impress me. For more than one reason, I've been delaying reading ""A Death In The Family"". But a couple of days ago I got a copy of the 1988 paperback edition and from the very first moment (and that witty introduction) I knew I'd like it. The writing was indeed very good (and heartbreaking sometimes) and the story really deserves its place among the best Batman stories in history.",6,N/A
107032,Batman A Death in the Family,Nı§hca,98,10,3,"August 13, 2021"," 3.5 Stars!  This one was surprisingly fun read as I didn't thought I would enjoy this considering how old It's. This was a decent story overall and writing was not bad actually. Jason finds that his real mother is alive somewhere in middle east so he goes into search for his mother, he meets her and soon realizes that she is working with joker. But joker has some more evil plans. Both bruce and jason took one bad decision which costs Jason's life. I loved how this books showed lots of inner conflict and regrets of Batman. He realizes that hiring teen Jason was not a good decision and he regrets and blames his bad decision for Jason's demise. However Artwork was very dated even for the time late 80s. I dislikes the segment of Jason and his mother and her reasoning were stupid. The last part about joker in UN was not good either. Still it was a fast paced and fun read. It's definitely a very essential story for Batman fans. ",5,N/A
