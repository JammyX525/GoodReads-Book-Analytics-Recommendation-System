  ""What if reality (as perceived) were simply an extention of the self? Wouldn't that color the way each individual experiences the world?That might explain why some people get along so effortlessly, while others don't. Although people do keep trying.Yet, despite such predisposition, maybe one person's construction of the world, could influence someone else's.""
Don't we all, at some point or another, find ourselves stuck in a certain state? We make friendships, fall in love, communicate in different ways, yet each and every one of us is a seperate universe. At least that's how we perceive ourselves. Trapped in our own, confined space, we make believe that there isn't more to it than that. And one day, you lose the one, be it by tragedy or negligence or even choice and suddenly the walls collapse and you come to the realization that what you thought you knew was actually a pile of crap on a hot, summer day. What you thought you felt was only a cover-up, a big black veil to hide the real deal which is now deep and long since unapproachable. But what if it is too late? What if there's not to be any other peaceful spring evening with you sitting next to her, holding hands and trying to determine which smell is stronger and sweeter, the night flowers' or hers? Will just a memory ever be enough?

This is a really unique and carefully made graphic novel. Everything is relevant. The colors, the fonts, the shape of the bubbles, you name it. Masterfully crafted, multi-dimensional characters and a simple, yet deep story make this graphic novel a small diamond of the genre. What I liked most was the fact that it was gripping, yet totally realistic. No superhero, no magic spells, just life, love and philosophy. I also loved the ending because it allowed me to totally relate to the whole concept.Deep, moving, sweet and apparently unforgettable. 4/5",25,2
4070095,Asterios Polyp,MJ Nicholls,"1,995",3967,5,"April 21, 2011","The first proper graphic novel I’ve read! This was such a beautiful and heartbreaking piece of work, it’ll be nigh on impossible to top it. It is rich in glorious meditation, comedy, irony and romance, weaving deep questions of binary opposites, architectural philosophy, life-the universe-and-everything around a dissolving relationship story. I don’t have the vocab or knowledge to comment on the artwork’s nuances, but the artist subtly conveys shifting moods, attitudes, histories, metaphors and so on with clever little flourishes and lovingly precise ATD. Makes me want to abandon prose. Maybe those hip people murmuring in my ear were right, and this is the future of storytelling. ",25,7
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Jessica,583,23,2,"July 15, 2011","I don't really understand the hype over this graphic novel. I thought it was boring - an educated, middle-aged white man feels like his life has fallen apart so he jumps ship and tries to start over again. Maybe I just found his self-absorbed personality too off-putting, but I didn't really feel any sympathy for him or care about his ideas about how the world works. In spite of the sadness in it, it all reads like an educated, middle-aged white man's fantasy: Asterios Polyp is world-renowned in his field, he spends his time womanizing but eventually a much younger half-Asian woman just can't resist him and marries him, and even when she leaves him and his apartment is destroyed in a fire, he is immediately able to land a job working at a car-repair shop on the strength of his answer to the question ""You ever work on cars before?"" - ""A little."" Then he goes and spends an hour at the library reading about car repair so that he can fake his way in his new job. Seriously? That's just insulting to anyone who actually works in that field.

4070095,Asterios Polyp,Jimmy,511,687,4,"November 5, 2009","I might have to read this one again to catch all the subtleties of the story. What's amazing about this graphic novel is that it is jam-packed with ideas, but most of the ideas are embedded in the art itself, and not in the words (some of it is in words, but it's like a riff that plays along with the visuals). At the same time, all these ideas do not in any way make it a gooey-dense landscape to slodge through. The book is such a pleasure to read, filled with so many wide open panels, so much white space, you will feel like you are standing on top of the Pyrenees. In addition, the colors here are just amazing, usually playing with a very limited palette (see above). And the versatility of artistic styles he is able to employ, and always for a purpose. Different characters are drawn in different styles, different color schemes, and even different fonts in their speech bubbles. These tell you so much about each character. But he's able to pull it off without being too obvious or corny.I'm stealing these images from Parka Blogs:The story itself is very simple, but full of digressions, flashbacks, and dream-sequences. Ideas and themes circle and come back repeatedly in different forms. In terms of ideas, it's wonderfully complex and wonderfully simple at the same time. What I like about it is that it feels breezy. There was much humor in here as well, some of which made me laugh out loud. My favorite character was Willy Illium, who was drawn in the funniest way. I especially liked it when he was drawn as a little baby.As far as the downsides: it is a graphic novel of ideas. As such, there is a feeling that the characters represent ideals that don't really exist in the real world. At times the characters seem very real (the dialogue is well written, and the bodily gestures are so well drawn, just spot on!), but at other times they seem like symbols only of bigger ideas. This can be a little frustrating--especially if you hope to connect with these characters. Also, it seems to push these characters into extreme corners, whereas I feel like they need more room to be complex characters, embodying many different ideas and contradictions. It seems like Asterio's problems with putting things into tidy either/or boxes is also an extension of David Mazzucchelli's same impulse. Perhaps he was writing about himself a little in that part.*** MAJOR ****** SPOILERS ****** BELOW ***It is a testament to how distancing the story is that at the end, when the asteroid destroys everyone (itself a pretty immature narrative device), I didn't feel shocked or anything. I know this is sounding harsh, but it really isn't if you read this without expecting to care much for the characters, but only to be stimulated by the visual representation of ideas.More thoughts on the asteroid: yes, it didn't sit well with me. I can't decide if it's a really horrible idea or just a pretty bad idea. One thing is that it circles back to the theme of randomness and chance... why one brother lived, yet the other died. Here we have something with the asteroid, which would be the taking away of this brother's life, but in an more unlikely scenario. Is it just chance or was there a reason for it? Given all this, I still don't think it is justification enough for such an ending, because it really does make the whole book too obviously about ideas and ideas alone.Let me know what your thoughts on this are.",19,18
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Tom LA,585,215,5,"February 2, 2019","Wow. Just finished in one reading session this magical work of art. Together with ""Daytripper"", this is my all time favorite graphic novel. I don't have much to say about it, as I don't think I have rationalized it much yet: visually, it's extremely creative and exciting. Rich with inventions and ideas. The story reminded me of a Chinese saying: ""Two thirds of what we see is behind our eyes"", and a lot of this novel is about that crucial aspect of human existence. I see this as a love story, and - among many other things - a story about the communication challenges that we experience because of our differences. The way humans interact with each other is visualized with such elegance! But what I loved the most is that this graphic novel has a living and breathing soul, a true soul that you can see much better in the second part. I found myself to be really moved towards the end. And also I think I found a certain kind of wisdom, that sees through selfish attitudes and behaviours as something that needs to be overcome and understood, in order to grow up. Asterios and Hana are one of the most fascinating and real couples I've ever encountered in fiction. Bravo, David!! Straordinario!!",18,10
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Gregsamsa,73,338,4,"August 17, 2013","I so wish more graphic novelists did what Mazzucchelli did in this one. Rather than merely have the graphic element supplement the story, Asterios Polyp makes graphics a part of the theme, using it to highlight conflicts and characterize its protagonists.Asterios Polyp is a critically respected and self-regarding ""theoretical architect,"" meaning that he has created some prize-winning designs and plans--none of which has ever been built. The narrative structure is framed by the new more humble life he has set out to claim after his Manhattan apartment went up in flames, as we get his pre-disaster life through flashbacks.The visual style used to contrast the small-town escape from his previously elite life are what you'd expect: curves, visual ellipses, and informal open-framed illustration versus squares, cubes, angles, and tight frame composition. In the latter (the NY flashbacks) we see the womanizer Asterios finally settle down with one woman, Hana, an age-inappropriate Japanese-American modernist artist in her own right whose star threatens to rise once she's asked to do the set design for an avant-garde production of Orpheus. This invitation is off-handedly dismissed by Asterios when he incorrectly assumes that it is directed to him; when Hana accepts, the beginning of the end of their relationship is signaled by his condescending self-superior attitude toward the director and the composer while Hana (finally) gets tired of his smug self-superiority, resulting in the eruption of some expressionist graphic explosions illustrating their fights. Hana as a distinct person fades into a blurred red approximation of herself while Asterios finds himself segmented into his constituent shapes, his arms jointed cylinders, his torso and head crude blocks. These graphic experiments set themselves off distinctly from the depiction of the small-town life Asterios has settled into as an assistant to a car mechanic who rents him a room. They share the house with the mechanic's son and wife, a curvy wiccan Earth-mother type as far removed as imaginable from the sort with whom he surrounded himself in his previous life. Before the fire, Asterios was prone to lecture others on his own theories of design which he elevated to a philosophy of life, being a quasi-Platonic jumble where a theory of balance between the ordered and the passionate is contradicted by his evident overemphasis on one side of the scales, (demonstrated by an omniscient narrator picturing actual scales). A perfectionist even in the smallest things, Asterios applies this to even the banal as he holds up his favorite type of shoe and declares it a perfect example of ""shoeness."" Later his feet hurt; his supposed vaunting of the functional is seen to be foolishly subordinate to form, disrupting his pet theory that in the finest design the two are one and the same.This is a story of redemption, of sorts, not only in the moral sense but in the graphic, on the level of visual design, a narrative and thematic utilization of the graphic in ""graphic novel"" that I would love to see taken up more in this genre.",15,2

4070095,Asterios Polyp,Marc Kozak,250,61,5,"August 28, 2012","I've noticed that ever since I became single earlier this year, I can't stop talking about myself.This is pretty unusual. I am a reasonably quiet person unless I'm around people I have known for a while, and usually listen more than speak. However, lately I've noticed myself sharing personal details in situations where it isn't warranted. Nothing super sexy or anything (you pervs), but details that could have easily been left out of the conversation. Or to be clearer - I've been entering personal details into group conversations that can easily be interpreted as trying to funnel the spotlight of the narrative onto myself. (And yes, I understand that this review is more or less doing the same thing - isn't this supposed to be about a book? Hang on, I'll get there.)I'm sure there are plenty of reasons for this that could be explained using behavioral psychology, but really, I just want to stop. I get that part of conversing in general is the act of sharing, but not to the level of attention-grabbing and narcissism. So it was a good time for this book to come along when it did.Asterios Polyp is, believe it or not, the main character's name - a brilliant professor of architecture who is re-examining his life after losing his wife due to his own self-absorption. His ex-wife, Hana, is a quiet, humble sculptor - clearly going for the whole ""opposites attract"" thing. Which makes sense, as duality is the main theme of the book, of which their relationship is only one particular example. Mazzucchelli does work here that is absolutely unrepeatable in any other medium, utilizing his art (and particularly, color) in ways I've never seen in a comic book. Asterios is often represented in blue lines, much like an architectural blueprint, while Hana is reflected in simple pink.  The technique is used to great effect when highlighting the different ways the pair look at the same things. Asterios is brash and cocky, whereas Hana is calm and reserved. Eventually, Asterios' selfishness drives Hana away. There's a beautifully conceived, mostly wordless six-page, multi-panel scene of Asterios sadly remembering everything he loves about Hana that will send sensitive types scrambling for tissues. Again, I can't speak highly enough about Mazzucchelli's art - you can tell it took the guy years to make this. Every page is bursting with symbolism, intelligence, and creative panel design. For Asterios, duality was a central tenet of his life - things were one way, or another. Nothing, including his own relationship, was too complicated to be reduced to an either/or system. This obsession over opposition led to arrogance, bitterness, and ultimately loneliness. As with most stories based on the Greek myths (as this one is), Asterios hits rock bottom before he can transform and get back on the road to realization.I think this is an incredibly relevant and important look at relationships in modern times - where solipsism rules over sacrifice. Mazzucchelli has produced the best case for comic books at serious literature that I've ever come across. It was a good reminder for me to stop talking so much, and get back to listening. Freud said that narcissism is a natural part of the human makeup, but damaging when taken to the extreme. A simpler concept in theory than in execution, but Asterios Polyp shows exactly why it's worth thinking about.",12,3
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Billie Tyrell,144,22,5,"April 14, 2021","The other day a friend of mine said I was cheating on Good Reads because I was listing so many graphic novels. The thing is, I read them fairly often because they are quick to read, and often they aren't so intellectually stimulating and usually involve people whacking each other in the face. Even the comics by popular Vertigo writers like your Neil Gaimans and Alan Moores will usually have a violent factor in most of their work. So anyway.... what does any of the above have to do with Asterios Polyp. Well, there's barely any violence at all in this comic. Really, not much happens, but at the same time a lot of things happen. I think this is up there with some of the best serious literature I've read. Sometimes when I read things I like to imagine why the person who created it did so... so the more unique a piece of art the more I start to wonder this. Why would anyone want to make such a well crafted and carefully thought through graphic novel about an architect struggling with his preconceptions on the nature of duality? Being able to ask that question is a wonderful feeling. SPOILER WARNINGI was really sad about the cat at the end. ",12,3
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Lee Klein ,785,830,5,"March 1, 2010","""Wah,"" I said aloud when finishing this. ""God. Lovely. Really great,"" I also said. Unputdownably beautiful. A blatantly philosophical, simple love story. Vivid characters. Funny. Touching: in fact, it successfully revealed the presence of my heartstrings -- sentimental loon I am not, but I definitely felt something pull in the vicinity of my chest region toward the end. Sort of like Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth meets a way more formally sophisticated The Elegance of the Hedgehog, spiked with references to the Odyssey, apparently (so sayeth the blurbs I just read). The blurbs also say it's ""difficult,"" but the time shifts won't be a problem if you're semi-accustomed to Faulkner and Chris Ware -- handled really fluidly and elegantly here, with the various temporal threads color-coded (eg, yellow pages indicate a dream sequence) the way Faulkner originally wanted for The Sound and the Fury. Will lend my copy to my mama and will read again when she returns it. Perfect deep winter company.Thanks to Mr. Vollmer for the rave (""not eye candy -- this is eye crack""). But how'd I just find out about it a few days ago?! What else is similarly supergood and lurking around the corner? ",11,N/A
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Licha,732,106,3,"May 17, 2015","I finished this over a week ago and for some reason haven't felt like writing a review on it. Maybe cause it's a little hard to describe without making it sound common. One reviewer described this best as a 40-something year old man's coming of age story. I would have to agree that that is what Asterio's story is about. Asterios must take a deep look at what dissolved his marriage. Most people would probably find him to be a jerk, but I really liked Asterios. He's just a man with many flaws but in general, a person with a good heart.There's a part in the story where as his wife is growing more distant from him and she finally bursts out at him. A slimy dance producer keeps making terrible, dirty innuendos at Hana in front of Asterios. We are led to believe that due to Asterios' inattention at his wife, she is falling for this dirty scumbag. Thsis dance producer throws crude remarks at Hana right in front of Asterios. He notices, but never says anything, perhaps believing he's already lost his wife to this producer. Hana finally has enough and yells at Asterios, asking him how come he never says anything to this perv. I found it so sad to see how the lack of communication, of inattentiveness towards one spouse, the appearance of seeming not to care could so easily crumble a marriage.It is an excellent story I hate to give that average looking 3 star rating to. This is a high 3.5 stars for me.",8,N/A
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Josh Friedlander,707,99,4,"July 8, 2015","A lavish, heartfelt story of a shallow intellectual's spiritual crisis and reconciliation with his lost love. Some of the existentialism feels a bit meh, but the synthesis of the ideas and the art - for e.g. as everyone's world view is different, each character is drawn in unique style - makes this stand out as a graphic novel worthy of the title, curiously powerful and immersive.",8,N/A
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Oblomov,176,45,4,"October 8, 2021","Fifty year old Asterios Polyp, architectect, philsopher, ladies man and burdened with a name that sounds like it should be examined by a dermatologist, had already fallen on hard times when he has the poor misfortune of his home burning down. Now without family, job or friends, he uses the last of his money to go to the arse end of no where and stumbles into an eccentric family's care, giving him time to ruminate on how he got there, in particular the story of losing his beloved ex-wife.Art: 5/5Mazzucchelli uses colour and framing to great effect and care, ruined only slightly by constantly bringing the readers attention to it like he's showing off. The story switches between the past with its many colours, motifs and stylised geometry: And then to the present with a more straight forward comic style and an ever present yellow tint.The characters feature a range of body types, from slim, atheletic, grotesque fat and buxom fat, and can vary in drawing style so widely it occassionally feels like different artists added their efforts, and it all makes for one highly interesting visual treat.Story 4/5This is one of those books where I feel a little uncomfortable for liking it so much, mainly because it's so much up it's own arse it's nearly turned itself inside out. In many ways it's an absolute mess of forced psyhcological, sociological themes and philosophy, covering and critiquing all manner of art forms (music, sculpture, theatre, architecture) and paying particular attentions to ideas of dualism, especially with our initial narrator, the protagonist's still born twin. It also fights it's own battle between tentatively addressing issues of sexism, sexual harrassment and self image, while also being highly objectifying and using some mean if not crass caricatures, particularly with the story's antagonist, a babyish bodied, ridiculous stereotype of the pompous auteur.Despite the muddled chaos and it's inherent pounciness, the book kept me fully invested, mainly because what ideas it discusses are fascinating and because it's also very self-aware of what its doing. Yes, Asterios is very smart, but he's also an insufferable prick, who not only suffers for it but gradually comes to terms with it. There is a distinct character arc, likeable people and gorgeously inventive visuals. It's a thoughtful piece, well worth your time.",7,N/A
4070095,Asterios Polyp,Monica,422,70,5,"November 21, 2012","This is hovering between a 4 and a 5 for me right now. Wow - really a sophisticated book. And can I just say that its so great to read a critiquely lauded graphic novel that is NOT a memoir. This was large in scope, nuanced in detail, and I think I need to read it again to grasp it all. The art was unexpected, with a mix of styles that really worked well together. Totally recommended to all my comic and literary fiction reading friends alike.",7,2
