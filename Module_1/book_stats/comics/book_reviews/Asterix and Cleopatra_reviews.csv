122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Nandakishore Mridula,"1,238",2205,5,"January 31, 2016","""You can't argue with Cleopatra. She may have a foul temper, but such a lovely nose!""- Getafix the DruidFor the first time, another historical character other than Caesar enters the Asterix universe. I salute Goscinny and Uderzo on their conception of Cleopatra as a tantrum-throwing terror, permanently stuck in teenage. Even though this may be a possible crime against her memory, their conception of the queen is somehow sweet and endearing.This is the first adventure where Dogmatix becomes an integral part of the Asterix universe. Having followed Asterix and Obelix in the hope of getting a bone in their previous adventure (Asterix and the Banquet), he has appropriated Obelix as his master, who is hopeful of teaching his ""little dog"" to fetch menhirs. Well, whether he learns that or not, Dogmatix is instrumental in saving the lives of the team in this adventure!The most enjoyable part of this book is the dialogue in hieroglyphics and its translation. I laughed myself to tears over it!",27,14
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Dirk Grobbelaar,550,1045,5,"March 4, 2020","Okay, so this is one of the really good Asterix books. It’s a favourite of just about everyone I’ve ever discussed these books with, and for good reason.The general storyline here is quite strong, and in fact probably one of the better ones in the series. In order to prove to Julius Caesar that the Egyptian people are still capable (and not decadent, as Caesar implies), Cleopatra commissions the building of a palace for the Roman Emperor. The Gauls get pulled into the affair when the help of Getafix the Druid is enlisted.The authors examine the relationship between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra. The story takes place during Caesar’s occupation of Alexandria, and while the Asterix stories take place around 50 B.C., there isn’t mention of a joint rulership between Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy (he doesn’t feature here at all) so it’s possible that these events are intended to have taken place after the Battle of the Nile in 47 B.C. I’m reading the series in order, so it’s still a while before I get to Asterix and Son, which touches on the subject of Caesar and Cleopatra again, notably via their son Caesarion. We'll see what we will see, but I enjoy the historical context of these books tremendously.Ancient Egypt is portrayed as suitably exotic for the most part, and the story is a delightful look at Egyptian culture and landmarks such as the Pyramids and the Nile. Intrigue is provided by a conniving rival architect, and the Romans, who all seek to disrupt the building (there is a strict deadline). The book even touches on labour relations and industrial espionage. And yes, we get to see how the Sphinx lost its nose. As with the other Asterix books it’s a send up of all concerned and the humour is just fantastic. As you may imagine, the Gauls have dealings with Cleopatra, and the way she is portrayed here is just bucketloads of fun.Highly recommended. In fact, if you are going to read one Asterix and aren’t too bothered to start at the beginning, this is a great one to try.Addendum:Just a quick update – I have now completed Asterix the Legionary which deals with the Battle of Thapsus (which took place in 46 B.C.). This gives some additional context to my guesstimate of 47 B.C. above. ",24,3
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Kavita,752,361,5,"March 1, 2020","Queen Cleopatra is annoyed with Julius Ceasar, who thinks Egypt is not a great nation. In order to show him that the Egyptians are still great, she makes a bet with him that she would build a magnificent palace. She appoints Edifis as her architect, but there are forces out to destroy both the architect and the queen. As luck would have it, Edifis knows Getafix and requests his help. Asterix and Obelix drag along. I loved how bad Edifis' buildings were! His own house falls apart in moments. Dogmatix has a larger presence in this book for the first time. And I really loved how the three go sightseeing the Giza Pyramids.Two things I absolutely loved: We now know how the Sphinx lost its nose (Obelix breaks it!), and the way the Gauls offer to help build the Suez Canal. A brilliant book with loads of laughs!",11,N/A
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,David Sarkies,"1,772",300,4,"October 4, 2017","Asterix comes to save Egytian nationalism22 July 2012	This album was somewhat more entertaining that the last one that I read though I am not really sure why. While Ceaser has always been portrayed as the villain in the Asterix albums, we begin to see more of his scheming and manipulative nature in this one. Cleopatra and Ceaser are having an argument as to whether Egypt is in decline or not, and Cleopatra decides to make a bet with him to build a palace for Ceaser in three months, however the only architect that she has is really bad, so he visits Amorica to see his old friend Getafix and as a result Asterix, Obelix, Dogmatix, and Getafix all go on a trip to Egypt to help Cleopatra win the bet.	One thing that you cannot say about Asterix comics is that they are historically accurate: they are not. While there are a number of jokes that relate to the period in which it is set (and the more you understand the ancient world the more the jokes make sense) they are not attempting to accurately recreate the period. Though I will discuss this more below, one thing that was difficult in those days was travelling long distances, and the voyage from Rome to Alexandria was not an easy one.	Egypt was not strictly the Egypt of the Pharoahs anymore, and had not been since the Assyrian invasion. In fact since the Egyptians lost the battle of Carcamesh to the Assyrians the once great Pharonic empire was in decline. Things changed when Alexander marched into the country and established the city of Alexandria and Egypt once again rose out of the ashes, but this time as a hybrid Greek-Egyptian culture. This new country was ruled by the Ptolemies for about two hundred years until this particular period. Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemies to sit on an Egyptian throne, and with her death, Egypt became another province of Rome.	At this particular period Ceaser was in Egypt simply because Pompey had been murdered after he fled there at the end of the civil war. Ceaser travelled to Egypt not so much to bring Pompey's body home, but to seek out his murderers and punish them accordingly. However while he was there Ceaser decided that he would leave a Roman garrison in Egypt and thus incorporating it into Rome as a protectorate. This lead to a brief skirmish between Ceaser's and Cleopatra's troops which resulted in the burning down of the Great Library (it was subsequently rebuilt and restocked and remained so until it was ultimately destroyed when the Muslims invaded).	The other thing that I wanted to comment on with this album is the impossibility of being able to complete the task at hand. Even without having to travel to Amorica to pick up Asterix and Obelix, it would have been impossible to build a temple in three months. In fact, having to travel to Amorica and back again would probably have taken three months (if they were lucky). Travel back then was very slow, and sea travel was incredibly unpredictable. However, as mentioned above, Asterix is not about realism but rather about using the ancient world to satirise modernism, and in many ways the setting and the stories have a nature of their own.",10,2
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Samir Rawas Sarayji,444,83,5,"April 27, 2019","I really like that this one opened with Cleopatra and Caesar instead of the Gauls. Caesar: She's a nice girl, only her nose is so easily put out of joint... pretty nose too!...Asterix: She looks bad tempered, but she has a pretty nose...Getafix: Very pretty!...Asterix: There's no denying it, she does have a pretty nose!Getafix: A very pretty nose!Obelix: Did you see her nose Dogmatix?...:)",10,1 comment
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Damian Dubois,141,94,4,"May 9, 2014","Ah yes, a lovely nose indeed. As cartoony as this Cleopatra happens to be she sort of reminds me of a girl I once had a crush on back when I was around the age of 19 or 20. Similar features, Italian rather than Egyptian, a lovely lass indeed. A mad thought crossed my mind, send the girl a big bunch of flowers, yeah, she might like that. Yeah, that didn't go so well... lovely nose though.It's been a long time indeed since I read an Asterix comic, possibly as far back as me being a wee lad under the age of 12 but I can still say now at the age of 38 I still enjoy them. Last week I had taken my daughter to the local library and while she was loading up her book bag with all of her stuff, I've sneakily slipped in Asterix and Cleopatra while she wasn't looking. When we got to the counter to scan them all in she has come across the book and turned to look at me as if to say, ""What's this then?"" I've just shrugged my shoulders and said, ""I have no idea how that got in there but scan it anyway as you'll like it."" Needless to say it's only I that has read it so far ;)I'll have to remember to borrow a few more next time we go. 4 stars.PS: While searching for my comic Cleopatra I also stumbled across this little beauty. The stunningly beautiful Monica Bellucci has apparently played Cleopatra in a live action Asterix movie! I have no idea if the movie is any good or not and I seriously don't care. How good does she look?!?!?! ;) ",6,2
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Scott,287,289,5,"June 26, 2020","The world's favourite performance-enhancing drug fuelled Frenchmen hit Egypt!While on their North African holiday they engage in some substance-assisted heavy-masonry erection (apparently there were no pee tests on ancient Egyptian construction sites), share their picker-uppers with the local slaves, get stuck in a pyramid where their escape requires a larger dose of Gaul-steroids than usual, and engage in their usual roid-rage battles with the Roman authorities.At stake is Cleopatra’s prestige in the face of the arrogant Empire of Julius Caesar, and to help the most beautiful woman on earth (or at least the one with the most beautiful nose), our Frenchmen will leave no Italian unpunched and no mysterious bottles of gym-juice undrunk.Jokes aside, this is my favorite Asterix and Obelix story. I first read it when I was seven years old, and I love the ancient Eqyptian setting, the Caesar-Cleopatra conflict, and of course the usual antics of my favorite French gym-candy fiends. If you’re going to read one Goscinny and Uderzo story, you won’t do better than this one.Five bottles of “magic potion” out of five.",6,N/A
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Joseph R.,977,12,4,"June 19, 2014","Julius Caesar, while hanging out with Cleopatra, makes fun of Egypt's has-been status as a great empire. Sure, they built the pyramids, but that was thousands of years ago...what have they done lately? Cleopatra defiantly claims they can build a palace to Caesar in Alexandria in three months. Caesar will acknowledge Egpyt's greatness if she can pull it off. She summons the best architect of Alexandria, Edifis, for the job. He knows he'll need magical powers to pull it off, but he knows this druid in Gaul. After a quick visit to Asterix's village, Edifis recruits village druid and potion mixer extraordinaire Getafix to help out. Naturally, Asterix and Obelix tag along for the adventure. Will they be able to build a palace or will they be fed to the Nile crocodiles?This is another fun adventure. They hit all the highlights of Egypt--the pyramids, slaves building things, the Sphinx, mummies, and the immortal beauty of Cleopatra's nose. Recommended.",6,N/A
122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Christine,"6,526",466,5,"June 12, 2012","It's amazing what a pretty nose will get you.Old ReviewGo read Asterix, any of them. Honestly. Even if you're an adult. I read them first when I was around 8-10, and I return to them periodically. There is one level of humor for adults, another for children. Adults will crack up over every name. Honestly, what isn't funny about a druid named Getafix? This edition to the series is great. Though there is no pun on Cleopatra's name, there are pretty of comments about her nose. A nice and amusing use of Cleopatra. I enjoyed how the Sphinx lost its nose.",5,3

122410,Asterix and Cleopatra,Tehanu,336,58,3,"May 28, 2018","As I read this, I experienced flashbacks of the movie. It's funny because, although I was raised with Astérix and co., I only remember the plot of one movie: The 12 tasks. So it was a surprise to see that I sort of knew this story.I really enjoyed it but at this point I have read funnier albums, so I have to give it 3.5 stars.Such a lovely nose!!",3,N/A
