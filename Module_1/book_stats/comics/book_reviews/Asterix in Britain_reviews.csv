71299,Asterix in Britain,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"February 21, 2020","Astérix chez les Bretons = Asterix in Britain (Asterix, #8), René GoscinnyJulius Caesar has invaded Britain and succeeded in his conquest; but a single village in Kent remains independent. One member of the village, Anticlimax, is dispatched to Gaul to enlist the help of Getafix the druid in providing magic potion for the British rebels. It is decided that Asterix and Obelix should accompany him, to help transport a barrel of the potion; but while beating up a Roman galley in the English Channel, Obelix mentions the mission, which is reported to the Roman high command in Britain.In Britain, the barrel of potion is confiscated from a pub cellar owned by Dipsomaniax, along with all the barreled ""warm beer"" (bitter) and wine in Londinium, by the Romans, who set about tasting the barrels to find the right one. Soon the whole unit assigned to the testing is hopelessly drunk; whereupon Asterix and Obelix steal all the barrels labelled with Dipsomaniax's name, but Obelix is himself drunk and starts a fight with some passing Roman soldiers. During the commotion a thief steals the cart with the barrels. Anticlimax and Asterix leave Obelix at Dipsomaniax's pub to sleep off his hangover; but while Anticlimax and Asterix go in search of the thief, the Romans capture the sleeping Obelix and Dipsomaniax, and raze the pub.In the Tower of Londinium, Obelix wakes up and frees himself and Dipsomaniax out of the jail, and the three heroes, after a search, find the potion in use as a pick-me-up for a rugby team. After this team wins their game, the protagonists seize the potion and escape on the river Thames, where the Romans destroy the barrel and release the potion into the water. At the independent village, Asterix eases the Britons' disappointment by feigning to remake the potion, with herbs Asterix got from Getafix (later revealed to be tea). With a psychological boost, the village prevails against the Romans, and Asterix and Obelix return home to celebrate.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز بیست و دوم ماه ژوئن سال 2005 میلادیعنوان: آس‍ت‍ری‍ک‍س‌ در س‍رزم‍ی‍ن‌ ب‍ری‍ت‍ان‍ی‍ک‌ه‍ا؛ ن‍وی‍س‍ن‍ده‌: رن‍ه‌ گ‍وس‍ی‍ن‍ی‌؛ م‍ت‍رج‍م‌: م‍ه‍دی‌ ش‍اه‌خ‍ل‍ی‍ل‍ی‌؛ ت‍ه‍ران‌: ت‍اری‍خ‌ و ف‍ره‍ن‍گ‌، 1383؛ در 48 ص، مصور؛ در 48 ص، رنگی؛ شابک: 9647135904؛ موضوع: داستانهای کارتونی و کمیک آستریکس از نویسندگان فرانسوی - سده 20 معنوان: آس‍ت‍ری‍ک‍س‌ در س‍رزم‍ی‍ن‌ ب‍ری‍ت‍ان‍ی‍ک‌ه‍ا؛ ن‍وی‍س‍ن‍ده‌: رن‍ه‌ گ‍وس‍ی‍ن‍ی‌؛ ت‍ص‍وی‍رگ‍ر: اودرزو، م‍ت‍رج‍م‌: م‍ه‍دی‌ ش‍اه‌خ‍ل‍ی‍ل‍ی‌؛ ت‍ه‍ران‌: ل‍ک‌ل‍ک‌، 1382؛ در 48 ص، رنگی؛ شابک: 9646488641؛ چاپ دیگر تهران: کلام، 1385؛ در 40 ص، رنگی؛ شابک: 9646143865؛ا. شربیانی",48,N/A
71299,Asterix in Britain,Pramod Nair,232,193,5,"July 1, 2015","Obelix: What do you keep on saying What for?Anticlimax: I say Sir, don’t you know what’s what, what?‘Asterix in Britain’ is one of my definite favorites among the entire Asterix series. Originally titled in French as ‘Astérix chez les Bretons’ the eighth title of the series takes the adventures of Asterix & his mighty friend Obelix to the land of Britons with a heavy dosage of merriment, legionary bashing, a game of rugby and sumptuous feasts with Mint sauce & warm beer. Ah! Let’s not forget about the pots after pots of hot water too.The plot begins when Julius Caesar defeats all of Britain except a tiny village named ‘Cantium’ populated by a bunch of tough Britons under a brave chief. In order to fight the Romans surrounding their village the Britons decide to seek the help of the defiant Gaulish village of Asterix and their magic potion. Anticlimax who is a British cousin of Asterix is delegated with this mission, which results in Asterix & Obelix taking a journey to Britain and an incredible adventure of infinite proportions.The clichéd British ""upper class"" diction allotted to the British characters in the book along with some of the cheeky references that are incorporated into the comic frames like the frequent consumption of ‘hot water with milk’, warm beer and boiled meat, enjoying weekends, are incredibly entertaining and adds nicely to the British setting of the theme. The keen sense of observation and humor that René Goscinny & Albert Uderzo invested while giving shape to the cartoon panels can be seen in some amazingly funny allusions they make; the ""little jolly-boat"" of Anticlimax and the way he is rowing it with a side-text aimed at the reader which read ""he was brought up in the tribe of the Oxbrigienses""; the frequent breaks taken during a battle for ‘hot water drinking’ and taking off days on weekends during battle; a guest appearance of the Beatles band; references to the idea of a Chunnel; frequent fogs and rains; & driving on the wrong side of the road; are some samples for these sharp observations. The illustrations are reflections of extreme artistry and the accompanying text, which is lavishly sprinkled with satire, verbal jousting and socio-political references, adds a level of balance, which makes the book an exceptionally charming one.A Jolly good book, old chap! Cheerio!Note: A more detailed version of this review, with some interesting footnotes on two glaring factual errors from the volume can be read from here.",24,2

Asterix in Britain is one of the good ones, and more fun for me in that we didn't have it when I was a kid. So I'm not able to read it in my sleep yet.Asterix's first cousin once-removed from England (Anticlimax) is part of a tribe of Britons holding out against the Roman invaders (sound familiar?) He sneaks out of the siege and comes to Armorica and the little Gaulish village seeking help. Getafix brews a barrel of magic potion, and Asterix and Obelix accompany Anticlimax on the trip back to his village.On the trip, Obelix gets drunk on warm beer (bitter) and locked in the Tower of London, which he promptly breaks out of. Asterix and Obelix also take part (accidentally) in a rugby match.The potion barrel is destroyed by the Romans (one of the few successes they have during the whole of the series, which is a nice change of pace) but Asterix pretends he's able to make the potion again, using some leaves that he took from Getafix (actually tea leaves, so they add to the hot water than most Britons drink, ergo having Asterix ""invent"" the tea that Britain drinks!).The Briton Chief (Mykingdomforanos) leads the village to victory against the Romans, and then tells Asterix he knows that it wasn't potion, but the psychological advantage was crucial.The lads return home after a feast, the end!

71299,Asterix in Britain,Dirk Grobbelaar,550,1045,5,"March 2, 2020","Another very popular entry. Asterix is called upon by Anticlimax (his first cousin, once removed) on behalf of the last British village holding out against Caesar’s invasion of Britain, for assistance in fighting the Romans. Asterix and Obelix accompany Anticlimax back to Britain with a barrel of magic potion, but things go awry when the Romans get wind of their plan. Actually, things get pretty tense, which is saying a lot (this is, after all, an Asterix story). The Romans go all out to capture or destroy the magic potion, and ill luck follows the trio around as they desperately try to smuggle the barrel through enemy occupied Britain. All kinds of antics ensue, and fun is poked at everything from British cuisine (there’s a running gag concerning warm beer) to Rugby. Even the Beatles make an appearance (Beatlemania would have been very real at the time this book was first published). If I were to make a list of everything cool about this book this review would be much too long. Suffice to say it’s a delightful story, and probably one of the few where things don’t quite go as one would have expected. At least we get to see why the British started drinking tea.Jolly good, what.",12,4
71299,Asterix in Britain,Nandakishore Mridula,"1,238",2205,5,"January 31, 2016","This one plays off the stiff-upper-lipped English against the hot-blooded Gauls. Anticlimax is Asterix's cousin ""once removed"" (a nomenclature which confuses Obelix no end) from England, who is in Gaul to seek Asterix's help for his village, which is still holding out against Caesar. So Obelix and Asterix cross the channel with a barrel of magic potion - but the end is surprisingly different from what one would expect.Throughout the book, English manners, customs, food (boar in mint sauce!) and drink (warm beer!) exasperate the Gauls - but what really floors them is how these stiff collars are transformed into a bunch of bloodthirsty savages once inside a rugby stadium!",12,1 comment
71299,Asterix in Britain,Renuka,78,55,4,"September 16, 2018"," Asterix: What can I offer you, Anticlimax? A boar? Goat's Milk? Beer?Anticlimax: A cup of hot water with a spot of milk, please.Obelix: ???? I laughed throughout while reading this one! It was fun to watch Obelix getting irritated by the British culture and values. The best part was when he gets drunk.And how can I forget the Rugby match. :D :D",12,3
71299,Asterix in Britain,Kavita,752,361,5,"April 14, 2020","Each Asterix is better than the last one! In this one, Asterix's cousin, Anticlimax, comes from far-off Britain to seek his help. Britain had fallen under Roman rule because of the British custom of drinking hot water at sharp 5 in the evening and their reluctance to war on weekends. LOL! The two set off with Anticlimax and a barrel of magic potion. But Roman Britain is not safe and the barrel soon disappears!I really loved this book. Apart from the hilarious jokes about pots of hot water (indeed, it was Asterix who brought tea to the Brits!) and references to the Beatles, football hooliganism, London fog, etc., the narrative is quite sharp. We see the duo get into the usual situations with the Romans, but I found that Asterix in Britain has more pop humour and is extremely funny. I also enjoyed the running joke of how even Obelix disliked boiled British food and warm beer. :D If there is one thing I really missed, it was the puns with the names. I didn't find them as brilliant as usual. But there were some good ones like Surtax and Encyclopaedicus Britannicus. The pirates made an appearance, which always makes me happy!I'd vote Asterix in Britain the best of the series. So far ...",9,N/A
71299,Asterix in Britain,Agla,497,18,5,"July 23, 2021","My brain is fried and I still have to work so I'm turning to comfort/childhood reads because I can't take much more at the moment :/ I read this in French (obviously, those are the only things I'll still read in French) and as an English speaker it's hilarious to see English being translated literally when British characters are speaking. My enjoyment is purely based on nostalgia but that's fine. The jokes on the british currency and way of measuring things are hilarious and the story is still engaging even though I've read it so many times. Those books have a special place in my heart because they are grandpa's favorites and we would read them together so the slight misogyny gets a pass (even though it wasn't that bad in this particular one to be fair).",8,N/A

I own it in German, English, and now in French, too. Actually the non-English versions are even better because it's so much funnier to read in German or in (the original) French how the Brits speak - ""it is, isn't it"", ""goodness gracious"", ""jolly good"" and all that.To be enjoyed again and again.",6,N/A

71299,Asterix in Britain,Gary,931,196,5,"November 1, 2020","A particularly amusing Asterix album , it was first published in 1966 ,in French , as Astérix chez les Bretons and in English in 1970.After the Roman conquest of Britain ( veni vidi vici and all that...) , a small village of Britons holds out against the Roman invaders just like their counterparts in Gaul.British chief Mykingdomforanos -aided by his right hand man the Hibernian (Irishman) Overoptimistix and the Caledonian (Scotsman) McAnix- asks one of his favourite men , Aticlimax , to visit his cousin Asterix in Gaul , to seek help.The result is that he returns to Britain with Asterix , Obelix and a barrel of magic potion. The Romans have however got wind of the news , and they do everything in their power to make sure that the barrel of magic potion does not reach it's destination.Jam packed with all things British , there are guest appearances by the Beatles ( this book was written when Beatlemania was at its height) and Boadicea. The adventure takes place in such places as the governor's palace in Londinium (Buckingham Palace) , London Bridge , the Tower of London and the Thames.Our friends are introduced to Rugby and British food (which both the authors and Obelix do not hide their contempt very well) as well as tea (which unbeknown to our heroes plays a large part in the resolution of the story).There is even a reference to the Channel Tunnel (even though this was written in 1966 , 21 years before construction of the Chunnel begun-the idea was only being talked about then!).",5,N/A

Regardless, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Living in Britain myself, I agree with Obelix",3,N/A
