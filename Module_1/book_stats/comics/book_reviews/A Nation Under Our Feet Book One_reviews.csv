29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Anne,"3,784",6900,2,"December 18, 2016","T'Challa!I wanted to like this so much, but it was a snooze-fest that took me several days to read. The art was beautiful, lush, and vibrant...which was in stark contrast to the flaky, boring, dried out dialogue.Too much talky, not enough action. You know what?I've been sitting here for about 30 minutes, scrolling through Facebook posts (mostly checking out cat videos), looking at Instagram pictures (why do my friends take so many pictures of food?), reading other Goodreads reviews (sadly, they're all much better than mine)...because I can't think of anything to say about this title. Even writing about it is boring.*crickets chirping*Yeah. Ok. Well, the gist is that T'Challa is having problems in his kingdom. Several different (I think) groups are unhappy with him, and it looks like his people (or at least, some of them) might revolt. And, honestly, I don't blame them. Sounds like there's a lot of assholery going on. Now, I'm not directly blaming him, but...And that's it. shrugsThis is not my cuppa when it comes to comic book stories, but I want to read more about Black Panther, so I think I'll just dig around and see if there's anything more my taste in some of the older stuff.After all, he seems like such a badass...",127,64
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Kemper,"1,388",6647,3,"February 24, 2018","Guess why I read this one?Like the rest of the world I’ve gone Black Panther crazy after seeing the new movie, but aside from thinking he was pretty cool as a kid in the late ‘70s reading Avengers comics I wasn't all that familiar with T’Challa or Wakanda. So this seemed like a good place to start.Sadly, it isn’t.Getting an acclaimed writer like Ta-Nehesi Coates to do your funny book shows yet again that comics aren’t just for kids any more, and there’s a lot of interesting stuff that draws on African history and culture. The art does a nice job of immersing a reader in the world of Wakanda. So just as a comic book it’s pretty good on the surface.However, the problem is that Marvel has done a piss-poor job at making their comics accessible these days. You’d think with the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point that someone in charge would have realized that fans want to read more about these characters. Yet despite way too many reboots and retcons in the last ten years since Robert Downey Jr. put on the Iron Man suit they have failed miserably at cleaning up the continuity to the point that readers can pick up a book and know what’s going on. This isn’t just limited to creating jumping-on points for new fans either. I’ve been reading Marvel off-and-on for going on 40 years now, I have the Marvel Unlimited subscription which gives me access to thousands of comics including newer stuff, and I have no clue what's been happening in recent years other than managing to slog my way through Secret Wars. (And that didn’t exactly help clear things up.)That’s the problem here. This run of comics was released after Panther’s film introduction in Civil War and should have been a place for readers to start with or get reacquainted with T’Challa before his solo movie. Instead the story picks up after recent huge events have left Wakanda in serious trouble. I’ve read part of those stories, but even I wasn’t entirely sure of what was going on here. What chance would a kid picking up Black Panther for the first time have of making sense of it all? Plus, it doesn’t help that one of the best characters in the movie was killed before this book started. (But in true comic book fashion she is only mostly dead.)So even though we’ve got a title with real potential the demands of continuity of the Marvel universe force all these other recent events into it instead of providing a clean starting point. It’s the dilemma of trying to balance all the history of these characters vs. trying to let new readers into the world. It’s such a problem that even though the MCU gave the Marvel comics about 14 billion reasons to streamline stuff it’s just never happened. I know one of the reasons I like the MCU so much is that it’s the only place I get stories about these characters these days where I understand what’s going on.That’s the shame of this. I think if they’d have given Coates a mandate to do a soft reboot on Black Panther without worrying about fitting it into the aftermaths of countless crossovers that he might have hit it out of the park, but he was handcuffed by the same thing that makes new Marvel comics not a helluva lot of fun to read these days.But hey! They’ve promised a new reboot with this Fresh Start thing that sounds like maybe they finally understand what they need to do. I’m sure they’ll get it right this time…….*cough*",75,10
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Terence,"1,103",339,2,"July 28, 2017","The people of Wakanda are restless. They've been stirred up by a group called The People and some of them have become dangerous.T'Challa has been doubting himself and whether he can do the right thing to protect Wakanda.Meanwhile one of the Black Panther's Dora Milaje is sentenced to death for doing the right thing because of growing corruption in Wakanda. Her fellow Dora Milaje and lover will not allow her to be killed and steals experimental armor to free her.I was really excited about a new Black Panther comic especially having such a renowned author as Ta-Nehisi Coates on the project. Unfortunately very little happens in this volume. The thread that Wakanda has problems that need to be solved reoccurs, but the rest of the time is spent lamenting those problems and kindly trying to solve them. T'Challa is scared and frustrated regarding what's happening, but little of his persona is shown. The most compelling and forward moving aspect of the story is the Dora Milaje who escaped from Wakanda with experimental Midnight Angel armor. One of the lovers is sentenced to death for actually doing the right thing and the other can't accept her punishment. They embody the trope of wanted lovers on the run from their problems, but they are far from helpless because the armor they wield is powerful.The writing in A Nation Under our Feet feels very amature. Those bubbles are packed with words mostly philosophical and political in nature. It's clear the story will eventually go somewhere, but right now it's taking the scenic route filled with speeches. It's been disappointing thus far and I think I'm going to wait to read the next issues and volumes at my library or Marvel Unlimited.",43,5
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,2,"January 5, 2017","I’ve read some Black Panther comics before this but I’m definitely not that familiar with the character and I’m guessing almost 100% of readers coming to this book are gonna be in the same boat. He’s a relatively obscure character who occasionally pops up in ensemble stories with bigger readerships than his own books and that’s mainly where I know him from. Following his much-touted and well-received appearance in Captain America: Civil War last year, his forthcoming solo movie, and Marvel’s tradition of giving movie characters their own titles, here’s Black Panther’s new ongoing series - and it sucks donkey balls. This is Volume 1 of a relaunched series that’s supposedly aiming to appeal to a new audience - so why the fuck have we been given a Black Panther comic that assumes everyone picking it up are super-mega-fans who know the character’s entire history?! Black Panther is T’Challa, King of Wakanda, a super-advanced country in Africa - but his kingdom is in peril. For some reason his people are rebelling against him and he… is gonna do something about it. Right from the get-go I was baffled. Black Panther’s guards are attacking vibranium miners whose eyes are glowing green - what was that about?! They don’t want T’Challa to be King anymore? But he’s done well historically hasn’t he - what’s changed? It feels like you’re dropped into the middle of a story rather than the beginning of one. And then I realised how little I knew about the character when he started using shockwaves, electricity and shit - does he have a version of his own Iron Man armour, does he have superpowers like mutants or is he magic? These are all things you’d hope would be established in a first volume of a little known character. Apparently Black Panther has a sister called Shuri who’s in stasis for some reason and is having a vision quest for no reason to achieve god knows what or why. There are a couple of Dora Milaje (“shield maidens” - woohoo, I picked up some of the complicated lingo, I’m not a total retard!) who’re fighting the Man in Midnight Angel armours, whatever they are! A witch called Zenzi is up to some weird shit, a nearby country called Niganda wants to fight Wakanda for no reason, and someone called Killmonger is to blame for the unrest though why we couldn’t see him causing that unrest to start with instead of being told about it in passing towards the end, I don’t know. All of this was new to me and extremely badly set up. It doesn’t help that the syntax used is largely unexplained. The fuck is Haramu-Fal? Taifa Ngao, anyone? You know how captions set the forthcoming scene by telling you where, and sometimes when, it’s based? There’s literally a caption that says “Hekima Shule, Birnin Azzaria” - I have no idea what either phrase means. Is that a place, a person, a time, what? How many new readers are you alienating by taking this insider baseball approach, Marvel?! Ta-Nehisi Coates may be an award-winning writer of nonfiction but he’s a helluva crappy comics writer! He seems to have no idea what he’s doing - how to introduce characters, set up storylines, everything is a shoddy disaster. But he’s a black guy and artist Brian Stelfreeze is a black guy and they’re working on an all-black comic so yay diversity, right? And look, more diversity: the Dora Milaje outlaws are lesbians! Yeesh, sacrificing quality to pander to wretched SJWs? No wonder Marvel’s sales are in the toilet these days! Brian Stelfreeze’s art was pretty good as were Laura Martin’s colours but I really loved Rian Hughes’ logo which is on the title page of every issue - superb work, Rian! Shame that Coates stinks up the book with his incompetent writing. I would’ve preferred a ground-up introductory first volume, establishing who Black Panther is and his legacy, what Wakanda’s all about and their place within the Marvel Universe. Then, once your audience is familiar with everything, you launch into this country-in-strife storyline and it probably won’t be so confusing! Instead we got this load of rubbish which is nothing but incomprehensible garbage from start to merciful finish. I really wanted to get excited about a new Black Panther ongoing, especially after his spectacular appearance in Captain America: Civil War, and I’m still looking forward to his solo movie, but I’m done with this terrible title.

29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Matt Quann,605,374,4,"February 10, 2018","After being highly impressed with Between the World and Me, the last thing I expected was Ta-Nehisi Coates to headline a Marvel comic. But Black Panther is a great fit as Coates' digs into some headier themes than I am used to in my tights & capes comics. Coates asks an excellent question: why is the most technologically advanced country in the world ruled as a monarchy? This question forces T'Challa to reconsider his position as king of Wakanada and Black Panther while he is beset on all sides by new and fearsome enemies. The enemies, I have to note, are extremely well thought out and don't have the feel of the ""villain of the month"" trap that a lot of comics fall into. Coates' is making antagonists that are sympathetic, but also villains whose causes and motivations are understandable. So, all of this is good. Really good, in fact. But it's also only the opening chapter of a much larger story. This doesn't mean that the comic suffers in quality. Indeed, the opposite is true: this is a stellar setup. The problem lies in the fact that it is all setup and no pay-off. As such, I'll probably revisit this review once I've read the subsequent volumes to make sure that Coates' continues to build tension, and create a captivating story and cast. I love the way that Coates' really digs into continuity rather than shaking it off, and he obviously has a love for the Marvel universe that comes across through the script. The art is also pretty great. Stelfreeze is doing a great job of establishing Wakanda's unique terrain, technology, and has a great eye for action scenes. Black Pather's suit looks fantastic and I love the way his mask retracts and envelops his face as needed.My recommendation at this point would be to wait for the second part of A Nation Under Our Feet or the eventual hardcover compilation before delving into this comic. It is great stuff, but I felt it was just getting started and it comes to an end. Partially this is due to Marvel's frustrating trade paperback policy. Four issues of a comic is a bit of robbery at $20, when I would have gladly waited for the subsequent four issues in a single collection. I'm enjoying Marvel's post-Secret Wars lineup so-far. Especially the more intelligent and daring comic book narratives that are present in Black Panther and The Vision. If Marvel happens to be listening: more like this please.",36,3
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Chad,"7,292",853,2,"January 12, 2018","Coates may be a celebrated nonfiction author but the only thing I'd celebrate after reading this is when he leaves the book. You would think that this being the first new Black Panther book in a while, this would be a good jumping on point for new readers. You would be wrong. You need to have read all of Black Panther's appearances across the Marvel U in the last 30+ years to know what's going on. I've been reading Marvel books since the 80's and I still didn't get some of the references. Apparently, T'Challa hasn't been a good king and there are different factions planning revolutions. You'd think that would be interesting, but instead everyone spends all their time philosophizing and this book is a snooze fest. The only reason this book gets 2 stars is because Brian Stelfreeze provides very good art and it's nice to see him do more than just covers.",31,5
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Tori (InToriLex),448,359,5,"February 10, 2017","Find this and other Reviews at In Tori LexThese four issues introduce us to Wakanda in chaos, while T'challa struggles to be a leader who has to balance the use of his sword with the use of his intellect.  Right away in issue one we're introduced to hard choices, T'challa's step-mother decides to punish a fierce warrior for killing despite her having just reasons why. The comic draws parallels to the issues that plaque African countries in unrest. Trigger warning, this comic does show sexual violence, women are imprisoned and raped as a show of power by village cheiftans. Aneka and Ayo are two warriors who defect, are in love and give rise to their own resistance against factions who are unjustly hurting the people of Wakanda. 
  
  
    
  
T'challa's leadership is questioned because he has returned to Wakanda after it has been ruined by flood, and ravaged by villains. The people are skeptical of his leadership and a psychic preys on that vulnerability causing more division.The plot does explore the detriment of losing touch with our memories and innate power because of mistreatment of the earth. I enjoyed the fantasy/mystic elements that were featured throughout. This comic is fascinating to me because it's author is able to weave in significant diversity in sexuality, education and belief system. Women in this comic are also featured in leadership roles and as elite warriors which is a refreshing break from many other superhero comics. I enjoyed every page of this introduction to who Black Panther is and the many internal and external struggles he has to face to lead Wakanda. I read this because of it's author and subject matter, I usually shy away from mainstream superhero comics. I would recommend this comic to Adult readers who are interested in reading a diverse world full of fantasy, challenging obstacles and thoughtful dialogue. I look forward to continuing and reviewing the rest of the series.",29,1 comment
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Subham,"2,379",56,3,"April 13, 2022","Umm yeah it was interesting I guess!I liked this volume but then again I have tried starting it multiple times but never been able to but finally did and yeah its fun!So it starts with Wakandan people at lets say not peace and we follow T'challa as he is trying to solve the chaos but he is confronted by multiple new enemies like Zenzi who seems to influence others and Tetu, a tribal who seems to be forming some resistance against his rule and we follow his character doing some rather wild things and then there is the case of attacks and calming people down, rise of the midnight angels Ayo and Aneka and new enemies in the border and its pretty much an exposition heavy issue which is trying to set up the new status quo or whatever is for T'challa and Wakanda at large!Plus new enemies like Zeke stane which will make for an interesting confrontation, I will say this that I like how the writer weaves former storylines perfectly and shows the consequences of it and I love that plus the art is insane and like picking up in the middle of chaos is kinda awesome and makes for interesting storytelling and it sets up the world and future of the comic run in a good position!Plus the back up story of F4 vs BP for the first time was kinda okay and yeah its 60s stuff so hard to get through and I am not really a fan of those but still makes for a fun confrontation! So yeah do give it a one time read and see for yourself!",19,N/A

29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Marta,970,96,4,"January 9, 2018","This is not a superhero story - and that's a good thing. We have some of the obligatory butt kicking, but it is mostly about a divided, suffering people and their king. The nation is terrorized, lawless, in pain, people are blaming their king for not being able to protect them. He also blames himself. There is a revolution brewing, fostered by a shaman and a witch using ancient nature magic to flame people's rage. Members of the elite female guard have taken upon themselves to protect suffering women, creating a powerful female army.I loved that there are no good and bad sides - each party wants to help the nation, but wants it a different way. They all have to make tough decisions in no-win situations, are wary and troubled. The king feels divided from his people, who are torn between loyalty and anger. The ""deceiver"" turns out to be not evil, but a ""revealer"" of the truth. Technology is pitted against magic, monarchy against revolution, vile men against the elite female guard. The art is fantastic. The world is a unique blend of high-tech and traditional society. The characters are beautifully designed based on African traditions, the clothing, hair and accessories create rich personalities. I especially loved the sumptuous white dreadlocks of the queen mother and the old philosopher. The coloring is vibrant and changes based on the mood or theme. The story starts a bit haphazardly but it gains traction and develops into something forceful by the end. The drama is high - a bit too high, I felt there were too many heavy statements, a bit of levity occasionally would help the dramatic moments stand out. I also felt that the superhero branding did disservice to the story. I understand that this is how they pull in money, but sometimes it was difficult to see the king in that man in spandex (yeah, I know it is vibranium, but it looks like spandex), and his need to go out and punch people himself made him look rather immature.Overall - great story and arc, but clearly just a setup. Can't wait for more.",14,3

Maybe the next volume will get the balance right; I'm certainly going to give it the chance.Story aside, I really liked the artwork in this one. Brian Stelfreeze is creating some really striking visuals here and Laura Martin's excellent colour art is enhancing it even further. Art me some more, folks.",13,N/A
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Eric,404,73,3,"November 19, 2016","If you have any interest in starting to read about the Black Panther, do not start with the first volume of Ta-Nehisi Coates' Black Panther run. In fact, even though it's still ongoing, you may want to avoid Ta-Nehisi Coates' entire (contracted) 12-issue run entirely. I don't care if Captain America: Civil War made you really eager to read something about T'Challa. I don't care if you're a big fan of Coates and his writing. Ignore the praise his run has so far garnered. I say all this because the type of story Coates is trying to tell is many things - an Afrofuturistic struggle for the soul of a proud, powerful nation divided along cultural, geopolitical, gender, and ideological lines that questions the very premise of the superhero and his world it's centered around - but accessible isn't one of them. Coates isn't interested in, say, following in the footsteps of Warren Ellis' 6-issue run on Moon Knight (collected in Moon Knight, Vol. 1: From the Dead) by writing a series of self-contained one-shots that highlights the appeal of this obscure character for potential new readers. Nor is he interested in writing a genre piece that only requires cursory knowledge to dive into the story and explore the themes he's interested in like Tom King's work on The Vision, Volume 1: Little Worse Than A Man (a suburban, psychological thriller about a family of androids) and The Omega Men: The End is Here (a space opera about a interplanetary insurgency where the rebels and oppressors are equally ruthless). One of Coates' main intentions is to write the logical conclusion to all the events, incidents, disasters, and tragedies that have befallen Wakanda throughout various Marvel series in recent years: Revolution. In Coates' own words, “I am really taking seriously what people did before me. If Achebe did rule that country for a period of time. If Killmonger actually did kill the King, if Morlun did cut a swath through that country and kill M’Baku and a bunch of other people, if Doom did plot with the Desturi and overthrow the government and damn near did kill T’Challa himself, if Shuri and him did have this break and Dora Milaje did turn their back on him, if Namor did perpetrate this holocaust... what would that country look like after all of that?“This was the place that said they could never be invaded, they could never be taken over. Well, that’s no longer true. Who are you? I didn’t even come in thinking ‘I’m going to take this apart.’ When I started doing the research I was like, ‘Oh, y’all been taking some hits.’ I thought it would be dishonest to just start up again and say ‘hey the king is the king and everything’s great and everybody’s all right. Oh, and by the way, by the way, as far as we know, Shuri died in battle. The Queen was killed.’ I mean, come on!”As someone who's really liked what he's read so far of Christopher Priest's character-defining run on Black Panther in the late '90s to early 2000s (I'm halfway through the entire thing) and was emboldened to research the runs other writers had with Black Panther, I'm intrigued by Coates' premise and his first 4 issues (the stellar, sleek ink and colors by Brian Stelfreeze and Laura Martin also don't hurt), and for a first time comic book writer this is, dare I say, a good start. But this is because I'm already invested in and knowledgeable of T'Challa and Wakanda. Frankly, I'm just confused by all the positive reviews this trade has gotten by everyone who's admitted this is their first time reading about Black Panther and his country. I also can't help but nod my head in sympathy to all the critical, negative reviews written by first-time readers.3 1/2 stars",12,1 comment
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Alex,"1,419",4274,3,"September 6, 2017","The headlines were ""Ta-Nehisi Coates writes a comic book,"" but they should have been ""Ta-Nehisi Coates writes fiction."" Coates is famous for nonfiction. I assume he's working on a novel - who isn't? - so this might be seen as sortof a test run.Comic books are different from novels, though, and they're harder then they look. They're a team effort, for one thing - the artist is responsible for a lot of the storytelling. By tradition, writers don't interfere much with how the artists choose to tell the story. I don't know if Coates followed the tradition or not, but the artists here - Brian Selfreeze and Chris Sprouse - don't do an awesome job. There's a fight scene around issue 6 where it's literally impossible to tell who's punching what. If you feel hopelessly lost right on page one, yeah, so did I. And the story has to be tightly packed, too. Compressed. You get like ten sentences per page before things start getting cluttered, so you can't waste a word. Coates hasn't figured out how to do this. He's got a lot going on here, and he fails to communicate it clearly enough. What he's up to is taking a superhero spin on actual African events. (Black Panther, who's been around since the 60s, has always been African - the king of an imaginary African country.) Black Panther faces a revolution in his country; both sides claim to be for the people, as they do. He asks questions about violence and non-violence, as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o does in Petals of Blood and as Mandela did during the South African struggle against apartheid. He tries to pull his sister back from the tribal spirit land she's lost in, raising questions about old beliefs colliding with new ones, which might remind you of Things Fall Apart. These themes run throughout African history, and Coates wants to explore all of it.So that's a lot for an art form where significant space also has to be reserved for punching, and what happens is sometimes I would read the recap of previous events that starts each issue and think oh, so that's what happened. Also, not enough punching.",12,3
29246432,A Nation Under Our Feet Book One,Julie,932,240,2,"July 15, 2017","2017 Hugo nominee for Best Graphic Novel. I got so excited when I first heard that Ta-Nehisi Coates was writing the new Black Panther series, and so I expected to love this, but...Reading it makes you feel like you've missed about 20 issues somewhere along the way. It jumps right into mid-conflict, with Wakanda falling apart and its people hating Black Panther for reasons that I'm unsure of, and his sister being in stasis for reasons I'm unsure of, and a lesbian couple originally from T'Challa's dora milaje going on a misandrist rampage (awesome! but... why?).And compared to, say, Vision, Vol. 1: Little Worse Than A Man (the other nominee from Marvel), this focuses on big-scale revolution and war and Big Picture problems -- all of which is what I don't especially like in superhero comics, since I prefer the small, intimate stories. I had no idea what was going on or who anyone was or even where things were occurring (the 'this is where we are now' infoboxes tended to confuse rather than elucidate).Coates has obviously thought really, really deeply about Black Panther's history and canon... but this series was unfortunately touted and marketed as a ~*relaunch*~ that should get new readers into Black Panther, springboarding off his popularity in the MCU Civil War and his upcoming solo movie, but that ain't what it is. It is not an introductory volume at all, and so instead mostly comes off as confusing to those of us who aren't experts on the character already.",11,1 comment
