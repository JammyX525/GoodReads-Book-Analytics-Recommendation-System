71292,Asterix the Gaul,Traveller,223,698,4,"January 20, 2016"," A kindred spirit...  Family portrait. Sport/recreation/favorite pastime.=========For those not familiar with the Asterix comics, let me give you a bit of background, both personal and general.Let me start with Julius Caesar.  We all know him, eh? And most of us probably know that Ceasar defeated the Gauls, thereby incidentally Latinizing and unifying them. After conquering and annexing Gaul with a two-year war, fought from 52 to 50 BC, he did actually see a small rebellion, though not quite of the kind we encounter in the Asterix comix.The Asterix comics are funny, despite the violence depicted in them, for a few reasons. I normally don’t find slapstick comedy amusing at all, but here it is funny because of the wild improbability of a small little runt like Asterix - your typical weakling brainy nerd stereotype, beating up those brawny armored Romans. What is his secret? Similar to Achilles who was dipped into the River Styx which gave him superhuman strength/invulnerability, Asterix’s friend Obelix had as a baby, fallen into a cauldron of magic potion as brewed by the village bard, Getafix; the same magic potion that gives Asterix and the rest of his village superhuman qualities for a limited time after consumption.And so, Asterix’s village turns out to have been poor old Ceasar’s secret nightmare - the Gaulish village he couldn’t conquer! Of course this whole concept is pretty fun from a French-person’s point of view.The authors riff on many things through the course of the comics. One of them, for example, the way that the French are always going : “Nos ancêtres les Gaulois!” [Our ancestors the Gauls!]There is constant play with how the Gauls’ names ended in the suffix “ix” (for example, one of their great leaders was named Vercingetorix), hence, in the Asterix comics, the druid is named Getafix,  the big guy who carries a menhir or Obelisk around is called Obelix, the village bard is called Cacofonix,     (poor old Cacofonix - nobody ever appreciates his art - those barbarians!)The fishmonger who always has smelly fish, is called Unhygenix, and the little dog is called Dogmatix.  Asterix in front, Obelix at back, and Dogmatix - middle.",88,39
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Ted,515,744,4,"February 10, 2017","another UPDATE at bottomI got this over Christmas 2014, when I saw some lying in a book store. There are (according to a list inside the front cover) 33 Books available in English translation, available singly or in Omnibus editions of 3 Books each.I glanced at it, browsing a bit as it lay on the table in my family room for months. Amusing.I had really picked it up for my grandson, who's just turned seven. But when I tried to interest him in it, he was not very enthusiastic. Perhaps he saw a bunch or words he didn't understand? Strange punny Latin character names, even Latin words? Whatever.Finally a couple evenings ago I sat down and read it through. Of course that's what's intended, and it improved. Many laughs, though I'm sure I missed quite a bit because of the Latin stuff, even though I probably have more Latin than most Americans.And maybe my grandson, when a little older, will want to read it. Though perhaps it's just as well that he didn't fall in love with it and want more, they're quite dear in the U.S.If he'd liked it, I'd probably round up to a four.And how about my granddaughter? She's older (ten), but not here so often. (Too many athletic interests.) I'll have to try it, and she is a reader. She says she's tried Harry Potter and didn't like it ... but loves the Hunger Games books. How would one predict re Asterix from that? Don't know. UPDATE My grandson here with me tells me he DID like it, but there were some hard words in it. SO I'm updating it to 4 stars and we will be looking at it together in the future.another UPDATE Grandson now 9. He'd rather play games (board & electronic) than read right now. He plays the viola, and before he turned 9 last month had most swimming records in MD-VA-DC for his age. He's very good, if I do say so. So is his 12-year old sister, though she might be a better runner than swimmer, and might be a more popular and more caring young girl than those accomplishments. I'm blessed.",50,21
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Kavita,752,361,4,"January 7, 2020","By Toutatis! Everyone should read this beginning book of a brilliant series! We finally purchased the entire Asterix set in 2019, so I intend to read through the series this year. When a Roman soldier infiltrates the Gaulish village, he is able to provide information about the magic potion to the Romans, which leads to Getafix being kidnapped. Asterix sets out to free him all alone, without even the help of the magic potion. This story mainly involves Asterix and Getafix, who get into all kinds of adventures together. There are only a very few characters in this book, and the village crowd have not yet appeared. We only meet Asterix, Obelix, Vitalstatistix, Cacofanix and Getafix. But we get to meet the Romans and Julius Caesar himself. I am always left dazed by the brilliance of the puns in this series, and this first effort was no different. The English translation also complements the original French so effortlessly that it's a completely different level of genius. Plan to read all the books in order again, this time in English.",16,2
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Dirk Grobbelaar,550,1045,5,"February 17, 2020","As far as I’m concerned this is a good news / better news scenario:The Good NewsBetween the nostalgia and the clever wordplay, what’s not to like? The artwork isn’t as polished as later entries, but it’s still awesome. I particularly enjoyed the hair puns, and few artists can convey infectious laughter through their drawings like Albert Uderzo was able to. Of course, it helps if you have a bit of general knowledge, to more appreciate the satiric aspects of the comedy. This is the first Asterix book, and while a few characters are introduced, the only two characters that really feature are Asterix himself and Getafix the druid. Which brings me to…The Better NewsIf you enjoyed this book, there are many more where it came from. Almost all of the Asterix books are really cool. Personally, I think Uderzo did a remarkable job keeping the series alive after Goscinny’s passing in 1977 (you may be surprised to see which entries were published with only Uderzo at the helm, even though Goscinny’s name still appeared on the cover).It’s only toward the latter end of the series that there is a bit of a dip. In my personal opinion it’s only really in the mid-2000’s (with Asterix & The Falling Sky) that things went a bit awry. Here’s to almost 60 years of Asterix!5 stars and then some.",15,N/A
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Bruce,438,72,4,"August 28, 2016","Well, *have* you read all the Asterix books? It's a fair question. We've read these, but these aren't all. There are, in fact, at least 8 not identified here. Quick quiz Asterix fans - can you name them without resorting to internet memory? [image error]I had the tremendous good fortune to find all but a few of the published volumes in one of our local libraries, and to be able to borrow the remainder of those I could not find from a friend who collects them. If you've yet to be introduced to these intrepid Gaulish warriors, you really owe it to yourself to run out and find one of these books.For starters, if you have kids who can read, having one of these to hand will make you their temporary hero. But the artwork on display is tremendous (see, e.g., [image error] - this is a page from ""Asterix & the Laurel Wreath"" and -- in the second row -- pulls off the amazing task of stopping and running your mental camera backward. Behold, the semiotic power of comics!); the humor unabating; and the social, political, and historical satire merciless and timeless.It's a pity author Goscinny died so young. His creative partner Uderzo, while a wonderful artist, was not that much of a plotter or writer. The books he completed in the 30 years following his partner's tragic demise in the mid-70s aren't nearly as powerful as their predecessors. Since 2001, Pathe has taken to making live-action extravaganzas out of these (at least three to date), and starring no less a thespian than Gerard Depardieu, but as of this writing they are yet to be released in the states, nor does Netflix carry them. Somebody with pull fix this!Seriously, I can't rave about these books enough, whether written in Latin, their original French, or here in these hysterical English translations. Here's my nutshell summary of the complete Asterix and Obelix bibliography.Asterix the Gaul – introducing A&O in their milieu, facing Caesar for the first timeAsterix the Golden Sickle – A&O go to Lutetia (Paris) to buy Druid Getafix a new sickle (takes on protection rackets)Asterix the Goths – endless early Germanic intratribal warfare explained when the Goths take Getafix hostage across the RhineAsterix the Gladiator – A&O go to Rome to free captured bard Cacofonix; a terrific spoof of Spartacus, among other thingsAsterix the Banquet – A&O do the first Tour de France to win a culinary/military bet against the RomansAsterix Cleopatra – A&O in Alexandria when an Egyptian architect enlists Getafix’s help proving to the Romans that Egyptian culture is still all thatAsterix the Big Fight – the Romans have a Gaulish chieftain-collaborator challenge Chief Vitalstatistix to a winner-takes-all bare-knuckle brawl… and Getafix is out of magic potion! Terrific send up of proxy warfare (to say nothing of professional wrestling)Asterix in Britain – A&O find nothing better to do than help their cousin Celts beat back the Roman suppressing forcesAsterix the Normans – teenaged Justforkix helps teach the Norse the true meaning of fear. Extremely clever investigation into the psychology of thrill-seekingAsterix the Legionary – A&O enlist to rescue Panacea’s impressed beau. Shades of Billy Budd?Asterix the Chieftain's Shield – Turns out Chief Vitalstatistix has been riding around on Vercingetorix’ forfeited shield; what alternate proof can Caesar use in a Gaulish triumph?Asterix at the Olympic Games – was use of the magic potion at the original games the first instance of doping?Asterix the Cauldron – A&O learns the economics of labor as they are forced to earn back a cauldron of sesterces stolen on their watch; bright spoof of Milton Friedman’s and John Maynard Keynes’ theories (see also “Obelix & Co.,” below)Asterix in Spain – A&O travel to raise a Roman siege against a small Spanish village on behalf of an Iberian chieftain’s sonAsterix the Roman Agent – the denizens of our favorite village have to contend with an insidious new Roman tactician: a rumor-mongering, scandalous slanderer! A marvelous study of envy and petty jealousyAsterix in Switzerland – A&O are off to Helvetia to pluck some much-needed EdelweissThe Mansions of the Gods – As the Roman’s sponsor a neighboring suburban development, can our favorite villagers resist the corrupting temptations of modernity? Terrific satire of assimilation and upward-mobilityAsterix the Laurel Wreath – A&O become Roman house slaves in an attempt to steal Caesar’s laurel’s for soup flavoring (to help Vitalstatistix save face from a stupid wager); a clever look at the household economy of your average well-to-do Roman citizenAsterix the Soothsayer – Asterix sets out to expose a peripatetic fraud playing on the credulity of his friendsAsterix in Corsica – A&O provide an escaped Roman hostage safe passage back home. A spoof of either Corsican tribalism or the mafia… probably both.Asterix Caesar's Gift – big spoof of the political “silly season” as several candidates campaign to be the village’s next chief, sparked originally by Caesar’s mischievious deed of the village land to a no-account legionary (see also “Great Divide,” below)Asterix the Great Crossing – a freak storm blows A&O (on an impromptu fishing trip) and a longboat full of Norse explorers across the Atlantic OceanObelix Co. – an excellent companion to “Cauldron,” flipping the premise to the side of capital; as a recent Roman business school grad prompts Obelix to mass-produce menhirs for Roman consumptionAsterix in Belgium – A&O set off to Belgica to determine whom the local legionaries less like to fight, Gaulish or Belgian warriorsAsterix the Great Divide – an excellent companion to “Caesar’s Gift,” this one analogizes two-party governance to a Romeo & Juliet-style feud, as Druid Getafix calls upon a village that’s literally split right down the middle by competing co-chieftainsAsterix the Black Gold – A&O nearly die of exposure in the Arabian desert trying to obtain some “rock oil” for Getafix; prompting modern readers to ask, what good is this petra oleum, anyway?Asterix Son – the best and least muddled of artist Uderzo’s solo attempts, Cleopatra secretly hides newborn baby Caesarion from Caesar’s adopted son Brutus among our Gaulish friendsAsterix the Magic Carpet – a mediocre Uderzo plot that serves as an excuse for exquisite artwork (the ancient world from above); Cacofonix is flown by magic carpet from Gaul to a parched land of the Ganges in the hopes his horrible singing will summon a delinquent monsoonAsterix the Secret Weapon – haven’t gotten my hands on this one yet!Asterix Obelix All at Sea – haven’t gotten my hands on this one yet, part 2Asterix the Actress – haven’t gotten my hands on this one yet, part 3Asterix the Falling Sky – a disaster of an Uderzo story; the Gaulish village is visited by competing alien races respectively intended to represent Disney and manga cartoon styles (evenly-matched, you see)Asterix the Class Act – republication of separately published short stories in a single volume, including a spoof of the fashion trade, a tour de force Mad-style parody of various art/illustration styles, and a hysterically slapstick Christmas joke for which mistletoe plays the catalyst (and told without dialogue!)Asterix vs. Caesar – “novelization” of the ‘60s cartoon, itself derived from a combination of the plots of “Legionary,” “Gladiator,” and “Laurel Wreath.” Nothing to see here, move along.The Twelve Tasks of Asterix – “novelization” of the ‘60s cartoon, based on an original (and funny) plot which spoofs game shows; the Roman Senate challenges A&O to perform 12 Herculean tasks to determine if these Gauls be Gods. Best of the bits is the one that pits Asterix’s wits against bureaucratic futility, but there are other good ones as well.Asterix Conquers America – “novelization” of the ‘60s cartoon, itself derived from “Great Crossing.” Nothing to see here, move along.Operation Getafix – haven’t gotten my hands on this one yet, part 4, but I understand it to be another “novelization” that combines the plots of “Golden Sickle” and “Goths.” If so, can probably be bypassed without harm.How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy - – haven’t gotten my hands on this one yet, part 5 ",14,N/A
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Samir Rawas Sarayji,444,83,5,"February 23, 2019","Reading so much serious literature lately, this old classic felt like a fun indulgence on a beautiful spring day in the balcony. It took me back to my childhood when I would read and reread the series. It was just as good, I actually laughed out loud a few times and my neighbor turned my way wondering if I had a few screws loose.",15,N/A
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Pramod Nair,232,193,5,"May 18, 2015","Ah! Asterix and his picturesque little village in Gaul with its stubborn yet hilarious bunch of residents gave me such a heavy dose of enjoyment during my high school vacation days. Each volume of this series is supremely rich in wonderful cartoon sketches, lots of humor and superb characters. Full marks goes to René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo for creating a bunch of such loveable characters and an exciting series of humorous adventures based on political & historical references. The translations of the original French volumes are done with love and care to make them highly enjoyable.The plots of most of the books in the series revolve around the adventures of Asterix and his fellow villagers – who reside in an unnamed small coastal village in Armorica – against the invading Roman Legionaries; and their village is the last bastion standing in the entire region of Gaul against the mighty Roman Invaders under Julius Caesar. The adventures are set either in the locations around this small village or foreign locations. These adventures of the indomitable Gauls – mainly involving adventures of Asterix and his friend Obelix – thwarting schemes brewed by the Roman forces lead in to one hilarious situation after another, which are portrayed in rich and amazing illustrations and tongue-in-cheek text. In ‘Asterix the Gaul’ the reader is introduced to the little village of Asterix and it’s assortment of eccentric, funny yet furiously tough residents with witty names. There is the shrewd, cunning little warrior with super human strength named ‘Asterix’; his close buddy ‘Obelix’, who is literally a giant of man with an insatiable appetite for wild boars and massive physical power; the village chief named ‘Vitalstatistix’, who is mighty brave and hot-tempered and widely respected by his people; the village bard named ‘Cacofonix’ whose music is divine for his ears only; the druid of the village named ‘Getafix’, who’s magic potion is the secret behind the superhuman strength of the villagers and ‘Fulliautomatix’ – the village blacksmith; their names along with their antics can make you burst with laughter. When these indomitable villagers are not fighting against the Romans or going on with their daily life which involve a lot bashing each others head, they are busy involved in sumptuous feasts and enjoying the heavenly music of ‘Cacofonix’ by either running away from him or tying him up.In this first book of this series, ‘Crismus Bonus’, one of the centurions of the invading Roman army finds the secret about the magic potion, which gives super human strength to the Villagers. ‘Crismus Bonus’ plans to steal this secret for his personal agenda of overthrowing Julius Caesar and for that purpose captures Getafix. Asterix infiltrates the Roman garrison to rescue Getafix and the rest of the plot is based on Asterix’s cunning machinations aimed at foiling the plans of ‘Crismus Bonus’.If you haven’t yet met Asterix and his bunch of friends then taking up his adventures wont disappoint you.",12,N/A
71292,Asterix the Gaul,Scarlett Readz and Runz....Through Novel Time & Distance,447,333,4,"September 1, 2017","This is a goody from my childhood that I haven’t read in years. I guess I felt a little sentimental picking this up.The Asterix & Obelix comics started being published in 1959 by French authors Rene Goscinny, Albert Uderzo and Jean-Yves Ferri. Since then over 30 books in this series were translated into over 100 languages today. I myself read the German translations as a kid. To this day, boys and girls in Europe are still reading and enjoying these comics as well as the adaptated movies which are great - those I want to re-watch as well, but guess what, I have them on Beta Max tapes and no player!Asterix and his friends live in a small village in the Roman occupied Gaul around 50 BC. All the occupants of this village are holding out from being invaded by the Roman legions of Julius Caesar. They do this by making a potion that gives them super power, strength and speed. They are already very clever and can outwit anyone before they know it. As the Romans are trying to conquer this last village, they realize something isn’t right about these Gauls that retaliate them albeit being outnumbered. So, they send in a spy to find out what the Gauls are doing to be so strong. But Asterix and his friends are not from yesterday. They know how to fool the Romans and embarrass them at the same time. I enjoyed this clean classic graphic novel. The print of my copy had the original sketches, nothing enhanced, and it was a super quick read. This would be fun for any kid that isn’t addicted to electronics yet or has had a lot of exposure to that. Who doesn’t want to have super powers and play Asterix in the back yard! ",11,N/A

You can even read Harry Potter in Latin...)I must say, I had a bit of difficulty adjusting to the English names. After 25+ years of Abraracourcix, Assurancetourix and Panoramix, it's a bit strange seeing them being named Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix and Getafix...
