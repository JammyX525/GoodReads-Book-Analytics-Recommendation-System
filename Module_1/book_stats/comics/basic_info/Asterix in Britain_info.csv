Asterix and Obelix are invited to help. They must face fog, rain, warm beer and boiled boar with mint sauce, but they soon have Governor Encyclopaedicus Britannicus's Romans declining and falling.

Or even the first ever tea-party?","René Goscinny (1926 - 1977) was a French author, editor and humorist, who is best known for the comic book 
  Asterix
, which he created with illustrator Albert Uderzo, and for his work on the comic series Lucky Luke with Morris (considered the series' golden age).",1085,1124,291,10209,"['4882 (47%)', '3662 (35%)', '1498 (14%)', '143 (1%)', '24 (<1%)']"
