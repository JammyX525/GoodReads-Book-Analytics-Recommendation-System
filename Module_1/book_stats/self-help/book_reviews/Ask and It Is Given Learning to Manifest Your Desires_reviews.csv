244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Jenny,5,31,5,"January 15, 2013","A full year after reading this book, and following the ""Ask And It Is Given"" Formula, the items I placed in my perfect heart shaped box, are coming into reality every day! I asked to create a best selling book to help children succeed in school - and did; I asked to crate a dream team to assist me in helping others become excellent readers and got one; I asked for a specific registered trademark which every attorney said would never happen, and yet, it was granted -- and so much more. This book doesnt' just tell you that the world is wonderful; it truly shows you how to connect with the perfection that is everywhere. Thank you for sharing your wisdom!",153,8
244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Caroline,211,64,5,"May 31, 2007","I am really enjoying this book. It is written in small digestible chunks, and although it is somewhat intense material to engage with originally (it is chanelled from a collective group of beings named Abraham, it is very applicable and has helped me to make some shifts mentally that feel great in my life.One of their arguments is that something feeling good is evidence of its being in line with who you are. That is advice I can certainly connect with. Very clear and easy to accept. I say give it a whirl. A friend passed it on to me and i am very glad she did.[http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASI...]",47,3
244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,KC,527,22,5,"March 30, 2021","This book and Abraham's teachings changed my life. I attracted a great job, my wonderful husband, and more using the knowledge I gained. However, Ask and It Is Given is more than just a manual on how to manifest your desires (there are 22 easy-to-understand processes readers can utilize in order to become a match to their desires). It's also a book that will either challenge or confirm your beliefs* about God, reality, the purpose of life, and the true nature of your own identity as a powerful spiritual or vibrational being. I don't know if I can adequately explain or give justice to all of the concepts contained within, but the key principles discussed include the Vibrational Laws that are responding to our thoughts (energy) which equal our vibrational point of attraction. Our emotions are equally important because they're a measure of what we're thinking and, therefore, doing with our vibration. The more better-feeling thoughts we think, the more we're allowing good and our desires to flow to us. This is because there's only one energy stream that flows from Source and it's one of Well-Being. So there's no source of evil. Just feeling good (allowing) or not feeling good (resistance). Feeling good holds greater significance than the manifestations because it's who we really are: good or physical extensions of God. That's why good feels good! I admit that when I first learned of these teachings I was more concerned about the manifestations than about feeling good. I have since realized that joy really is the true measure of success, while the manifestations are just the indicators of our alignment or not with higher consciousness (Source Energy). It's okay, too, if we don't always feel good. Our negative emotions are useful by showing us that we're focused on what we don't want and, therefore, we can then guide our thoughts towards what we do want.So, back to the Vibrational Laws. These three laws are the Law of Attraction, the Law of Creation, and the Law of Allowing. In addition to being universally and vibrationally based these laws, like the Law of Gravity, are also absolute which means they work regardless of one's beliefs or awareness of them. The advantage to knowing about these laws is that one can DELIBERATELY create one's life, instead of by default which is what most people are doing.How empowering is it to know that we are the creators of our own reality, that we are born with free will, that the purpose of life is joy, and the end result contributes to the expansion and eternalness of the Universe?I so appreciate this powerful knowledge, Abraham, and the Hicks who have tirelessly and lovingly helped to share Abraham's teachings. (Abraham is essentially Source Energy or God, but they don't go by the latter label as it has different meanings for everyone). I learned so many things that I didn't know before, or rather as it is stated things I didn't remember. Some of these concepts might be too unbelievable for others, but they resonated with me. This book is for those who are ready to receive the anwers they've been asking for. Ask and it is given, indeed!*Although the aim isn't to change our beliefs but to help guide us more towards what we want, happiness.",36,15
244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Kyra,36,26,1,"October 29, 2010","Esther Hicks writes for a ""nonphysical intelligence"" known as Abraham in this former New York Times Best Seller, Ask and It is Given. What I found most interesting in Ask were the deviations from Esther and Jerry (her husband) Hicks' 1989 book A New Beginning I, which predicted various ""earth changes"" that were on the brink of occurring in 1989, including simultaneous volcanic eruptions that would cover the earth's air with ash. In Ask, these revelations of turbulence are not even touched upon. There are also various inconsistencies within Ask regarding Jerry and Esther's initial encounters with Abraham, including an altered-or cleverly tailored version-of Abraham's first words. As for the ""biographical sketch"" provided in Ask about Jerry and Esther's life pre-Abraham, it is incredibly vague. It tells us that Jerry was very successful before Abraham, but does not mention that Jerry Hicks was a Crown level distributor at Amway, who was giving seminars about positive thinking and motivation. Only instead of using the Abraham works, he was using those of Napoleon Hill. Dateline did a wonderful expose on Amway, revealing a major business within Amway that was not in selling various appliances/supplies, but in selling motivational courses and materials within the company. It is clear that Jerry was involved in this sort of motivational selling with Think and Grow Rich before his Abraham work. While the effect of Think and Grow Rich on Jerry's life is mentioned in Ask, the Amway link is never made, though it is touched on in various interviews with the Hickses. Of course, this seems to be irrelevant to most readers of the Abraham materials. To me, this was an important fact that made Jerry and Esther appear less like sincere messengers of positive thinking and more like pious frauds for Napoleon Hill. The chapters in Ask offer an emotional guidance scale to let you know where you are and some 22 processes to help you reach a better feeling place to help you align with those things that you are wanting. The 22 processes include an interesting combination of cognitive therapy, visualization, and New Age woo. Though some of them seem very helpful, there does seem to be some undermining as the processes and rhetoric ask you to set aside critical thinking and replace it with emotional guidance. Also, for the entities that have claimed to not wish to alter our beliefs, these processes suggest otherwise, as they are designed to assist us in altering our beliefs. Various emotional appeals, combined with validation for whatever you want to believe in, make this book very appealing to anyone who wants approval or to believe that they can be, do, or have anything they want. This book operates under the claim that it will help you manifest your desires. But buyers beware, the authors take no responsibility for anything you are unable to manifest using their processes and there are no objective means for testing how well you are doing. And based on the logic presented within the book, even if you are unable to manifest something: All is well. I do not recommend this book to someone trying to manifest something, but rather to someone who wants to become a devotee of one of the most popular channels of our time. When you find yourself needing to listen to their CDs and watch their youtube videos more than anything else, that's when you know you've found a friend.",27,3

The cover looked, and the titled sounded, like it was religious. Then I opened it and I started to make all these miraculous things happen. I have found it transformative to say the least. I read it concurrently with 'Conversations with God"" so the ""channeled writing"" aspect didn't phase me, really.",14,1 comment

244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Bobby 1,5,10,5,"January 15, 2013","I never wrote a review before but I felt compelled to do so. My sister bought this book and I decided to read it first.What impressed me from the beginning were the comments from Wayne Dyer, since he is my favorite author. I have several self-help books in my collection, but I have never read a book that gave me such a profound and clear understanding as to why I am not getting all that I desire in life. I read it in 2 days and now I'm re-reading it and highlighting just about every page and doing some of the processes. I can see the fruits of this book already. Please get a copy of this book. You will not regret it.Thank you Esther, Jerry and Abraham.",12,N/A
244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Lindsay,292,40,3,"December 29, 2017","Giving this book a rating is very difficult. On one side I believe it's a must-read for everyone who's interested in the law of attraction and all that, on the other side it's very repetitive and also I have difficulties believing every single thing like f.e channeling, (this book is not written by Ester but by Abraham, a spirit who took over her body while she wrote the book?) or growing new body parts if we just -believe we can do it-. Sometimes it doesn't make any sense at all. Nevertheless, it's quite interesting.",11,7
244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Jessi,122,60,5,"September 17, 2008","The original teachings of Abraham -- won't ever get tired of re-reading this every so often for a fresh perspective! Love it love it love it! Love the simplicity, the ease with which the Abraham-Hicks material brings out our natural tendencies towards joyful abundance. Reading Abraham always makes me realize that I have a tendency (and I think all of us who are slightly ""overeducated"" into believing in ""the way things are"" do) to overcomplicate most things. It doesn't need to be complicated, it's really quite simple!!! There's a ""system"" here for bringing our energy back into alignment with joy, especially when we're going through some of life's toughest challenges -- you really can't go from utter depression to extreme joyfulness in 0 to 60 seconds, and I like the gentle approaches given here in order to realize from within where you're at, where you'd like to be, and how to go about begining the journey of living intentionally in the direction of your hopes and dreams like flowers grow towards the sunshine...",10,N/A

244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Ahmed Faiq,303,71,5,"September 3, 2021","""The basis of life is freedom, and the result of life is expansion- but the propose of your life is joy. And that is why the main event has never been the manifestation. It has always been the way you feel in the moment. In other words, you intended to come into the physical realm of contrast to define what is wanted, to connect with Energy that creates worlds, and to flow it toward your objects of attention- not because the objects of attention are important, but because the act of flowing Energy is essential to life.""  Well from the moment I saw the title I was captured by this book, it is a way of life, and it must be considered to become the New Religion probably, how to Ask, and how to be able to Receive, how to Ask? By following your desires, because true desires don't lie, and the Source is so abundant it can Give everyone, no interference or muddling will occur.What is beautiful about the book is -as it tells you- it helps you remember things, that you already knew, we all remember how especially when we're kids how our desires and dreams were big, and truly we believed in being able to claim them, every now and then we come to such joyful and happy moments even later in life, it is sad that we forget when we are older, because these desires and dreams are the way, the real way to be happy and to get what we want through the Law of Attraction.It must be the new Religion, because -in contrast to classic religions- it changes the whole picture and the formula of life, your desires and your seeking for happiness are what you are, not fending them off and rejecting them, and through mindfulness and meditation you will be able to see clearer and get better and better.It is how you see it, because life is really special, see it through the kids, how they are happy and always on the go, whatever the circumstances....this book helps you to become a child again, and dream.",7,N/A
244383,Ask and It Is Given Learning to Manifest Your Desires,Jennifer,98,13,3,"March 13, 2015","Oh lordy. This book is so fully of kook that I can barely stand it (especially finishing off with Esther's voice, which is just as irritating as hell). And YET it is so chock full of useful instruction that I think I might actually want to own a hard copy. I usually prefer listening to inspirational-type stuff, and by ""inspirational"" I really mean all the extraneous stuff I fill my head with to keep me on track with where I want to go in life. And this is pretty good for that purpose, but it also is read so quickly and has so many ""processes"" (techniques) that it would be good to keep a copy as a reference. Of course it will all sound like total BS to the skeptical crowd, but it's really interesting how our neuroplasticity programs for healing chronic illnesses* pretty much follow the same guidelines as what is said here, if you oversimplify it to the max (min?)... and that is basically that negative thoughts tear you down physically, while joyful thoughts rebuild your body.Some more favorite quotes from that one segment on health: ""Every cell in your body has a direct relationship with Creative Life Force, and each cell is independently responding. When you feel joy, all the circuits are open and the Life Force or God Force can be fully received. When you feel guilt or blame or fear or anger, the circuits are hindered and the Life Force cannot flow as effectively. Physical experience is about monitoring those circuits and keeping them as open as possible. The cells know what to do. They are summoning the Energy."" ~Abraham. Huh. That again. Everything I read comes back to that. I'm also reading /The Heartmath Solution/ right now... same basic message, in more measurable scientific terms, regarding energy flow and entrainment of heartbeats and brain waves. And yet I keep falling off the wagon and obsessing about all that's wrong with my body and my life. Wake-up call #8749... Oh yes, and also, I need to remember the quote... ""Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self esteem, first make sure you are not, in fact, just surrounded by assholes."" Yeah. That continues to be my biggest challenge, though to be fair, the degree of assholeness does keep improving.So... more quotes:""Any time you have physical discomfort of any kind, whether you call it emotional, or physical pain within your body, it always, always means the same thing: ""I have a desire that is summoning Energy, but I have a belief that is not allowing so I've created resistance in my body."" The solution, every single time, to the releasing of discomfort or pain — is the relaxation and the reaching for the feeling of relief.""~ AbrahamAnd my favorite, because I love reading things that agree with what I've already decided to be true: ""Wellness that is being allowed—or the wellness that is being denied—is all about the mindset, the mood, the attitude, the practiced thoughts. There is not one exception, in any human or beast; because, you can patch them up again and again, and they will just find another way of reverting back to the natural rhythm of their mind. Treating the body really is about treating the mind. It is all psychosomatic. Every bit of it, no exceptions.~ AbrahamWell, okay I don't believe ""every bit of it,"" but I sure do think that it is most often the major contributor. Here is the full audio from Process 21: Reclaiming One's Natural State of Health. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Audl... If the video is taken down, a youtube search might find another source of the same audio. I'd like to get this digitized on my phone so I can listen to it repeatedly as an aid in brain retraining.But of course these messages are waging war with my western-medicine-trained mind, and even though I threw western health philosophy out the window a long time ago, clearly its influence is still strong. The mental discomfort and resistance I feel makes me steer away from that 4 stars and down towards 3. Ideally I'd like to give it 3.5 for now, but I suspect that after I get back up on the healing wagon, I'll be leaning more towards 4. *Gupta Amygdala Retraining Programme for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, and Gulf War Syndrome*Dynamic Neural Retraining System for MCS, CFS, Fibromyalgia, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, PTSD, Chronic Pain, and Anxiety",6,1 comment

It's a total rip-off from the Jane Roberts Seth books written in the 60's and 70's. The book is so repetitive. What needed to be imparted could have been in 3 Chapters. These people do know how to attract suckers. That's their law of attraction. Especially knowing how greedy Esther Hicks actually is...I'm sorry. I'm not negating Law of Attraction as it's been coined now but, these people are blood suckers, leeches...give us your money and we will pretend to impart wisdom and ideas you didn't know about. If people just take a moment, a confident moment, they will understand they know this already.
