57393737,A Gentle Reminder,Jack,48,13,5,"May 12, 2021","I spent the last year loving someone who wasn't ready to love me. It was an experience. And right as it ended, I picked up this book. I've been reading a couple pages here or there over the last 2.5 months as I grieve the loss of the relationship. It's exactly what I needed. It's the gentle reminders that I'm okay exactly as I am, that even saying yes to love is a gift, and that I deserve a relationship with someone who's as much a full yes to me as I am to them. I couldn't have asked for a better companion in my healing process. It all feels oddly synchronous. That I found this book when I needed. That I'm putting it down in completion right around the time that I'm ready to let go of the lost love. Much gratitude to Bianca Sparacino for sharing these vulnerable and kind truths.",161,2
57393737,A Gentle Reminder,Lindy,10,1 follower,3,"March 29, 2021","I felt like a lot of the pages or little quotes were getting repetitive, without fully expanding on an idea or thought entirely, just reusing the same lines over and over. There were also a few typos in my copy. I did find this book to have some poems that were quite profound and underlined quite a few lines and tagged some pages to read again later. Overall okay. I think I liked her previous book more. ",70,2
57393737,A Gentle Reminder,emma,129,78,3,"September 17, 2022","a rare contemporary poetry collection that did not make me want to gouge my eyeballs out due to how awful it was. instead, it consisted of numerous rather lovely poems that more often than not spoke to me, even if some of the poems did feel like they had come straight off of tumblr. ”Please, just trust the timing of your life. You don’t have to have it all figured out by a certain age; you don’t have to chase a version of success that does not inspire you. You just have to learn about yourself. You have to keep doing the work — not just physically, but emotionally. You have to learn about who you are on a foundational level, you have to understand what you deeply value, what ignites your soul, what makes you want to get up in the morning, and you have to choose that every single day. You have to stand up for it. You have to leap towards that hope, even when it’s scary, even when you’re the only one dreaming in that direction. Because there’s no point in moving quickly towards a life you don’t want. There’s no point in doing everything right if you are just going to end up unhappy. No—you are not failing at life. You are not falling behind because you are moving at a different pace than those around you. You are not odd, or delusional, if your dreams do not look like the ones society told you to have when you were younger. You are making your life your own. You are growing into your future. Never be ashamed of that.”",26,1 comment
57393737,A Gentle Reminder,Asmaa,127,24,4,"August 16, 2021",""" Maybe this is the season you are being challenged to make amends with your heart, to stand up for the vast ways in which it loves, and cares, and believes in the goodness of vulnerability, and expression, and being the person who softens even when the world is not gentle. Maybe right now you are getting a second chance — to trust in it, and to forgive yourself for giving it away to those who could not value it; but most importantly, maybe right now you are being called to protect it, to find your way back into your tenderness, to find your way back into your soul."" ...Anything Bianca writes is fire, and this is no exception.A must read and reread book ❤",17,1 comment

57393737,A Gentle Reminder,mia,452,192,3,"January 17, 2022","To be precise, it is 3.5 ⭐It is quite a quote-filled book that I found it hard to finish in one setting. It is like a meal, it has to be savoured slowly because it makes you think and enjoy the words. For me, it definitely brought me back to some instances of my life where I think I could have done better or made a better decision. It also helped me to reflect about what can I do to make my life better. Giving it 3.5 ⭐ because I found some themes repetitive and the book was a little disorganised for me. I couldn't jump into the flow when the theme/topic of the writing changed compared to the previous page. My favourite pages of the book were pages 135-138. It was very relatable and important to me. Overall, a thought-provoking read. ",11,3
57393737,A Gentle Reminder,Claire,401,6,5,"May 2, 2021","This book is the perfect balm for heartbreak. I don't think I would have enjoyed it had I not been heartbroken while reading it, which I actually think is a credit to the book. Bianca Sparacino clearly wrote this book for the people who need it. Because it is was so intensely targeted to just one experience, it felt like the words were directly speaking to me and therefore were so, so healing. It's akin to medicine - if you take medicine for an ailment that you're not afflicted by, it probably won't do much of anything. But for the people who do have that ailment, the medicine can be life-saving. This book was life-saving for me, giving me the exact comfort that I needed. If read at the wrong time (when not heartbroken) or in the wrong way (all at once rather than in small doses), this book could easily fall short. Its genius lies in how it is the exact right thing that a person needs to experience at the exact right time in their lives. And isn't that what love is?",10,N/A

57393737,A Gentle Reminder,Catherine,286,86,4,"December 22, 2022","This is one of those books where if it finds you at the right time, it can really be special. That's what happened to me.I agree with the other reviewers who said this is a bit repetitive, and for that reason, I deducted a star, but I really needed a book like this. I easily highlighted over half of it because the quotes resonated so much, and it even made me cry which I wasn't expecting. If you're feeling a little lost, this is a nice gentle reminder that everything always works out the way it's supposed to, in the right timing. 
  One day, when you least expect it, you are going to crash into someone who is going to be so soft and gentle with your heart, and you are going to be so glad you kept it open. You are going to be so glad that you continued to fight for it - that you chose to believe it deserved more.

57393737,A Gentle Reminder,Elizabeth Stefanie,37,6,5,"May 22, 2021","I always thought that I need a closure. A closure that I deserve. Then I picked up this book tonight to this:""One of the hardest lessons you will ever have to learn in life is that you do not need closure to heal and move on from something that had to end, from the kind of love you had to set down.We have to gift ourselves the closure we so deeply desire. We have to take responsibility for our feelings and understand that we cannot wait for someone to give us our healing. We have to heal ourselves.And that is something you give yourself. No one else is going to do it for you. No one else is capable.""Reading Bianca's writing always makes me feel things, in a way that I know I'm not alone, there are people who feel the same way that I do—I find comfort in her writing.",5,N/A
