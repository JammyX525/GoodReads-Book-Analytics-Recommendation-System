6023056,Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment,Reeka (BoundbyWords),349,76,1,"November 29, 2010","Ok so, I definitely have mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, I admire the fact that Steve Harvey gives it to you straight and without a TRACE of subtlety (or sugar-coating if you will), the reasons why the majority of men ARE the way they are, and why we, as women, are unknowingly encouraging them to continue bad habits. He made some very valid points, though I felt that many of them should ALREADY be obvious to woman everywhere (i.e. set standards for yourself, RESPECT yourself in order to be respected, don't accept being just his ""plaything""....like, cmon now).On the other hand-and I suppose this has a lot to do with the fact that I was raised in a time where chivalry was (and still IS) unheard of, and feminist views were strongly imparted in schools and within society- I simply cannot accept Steve's obvious conclusion that women need to put forth MORE than half the effort to land a GOOD man. Steve even goes on to (indirectly) blame women for their cheating spouses; their child's uninvolved father. Call me young and ignorant, but the real truth here, is that boys in this day and age just AREN'T being taught to be REAL MEN anymore. Someone needs to write THEM a self-help book on how to smarten the HELL up.Overall, I recommend this book for those with an open mind and a need to understand our male counterparts a little better-just take what you need from it.End venting.

Allow me to elaborate, please. Because I have lots to say.*Disclaimer - a friend asked me to read this with her because she is single and “not sure what she is doing wrong”. Girl, you aren’t doing anything wrong. And this is not the advice you need.*Things I learned while reading this (and believe me when I say that most of these are direct quotes):1.) Men are all very simple people and all basically think in a similar way.2.) But only straight men. Gay men aren't men. They are ""gay men"".3.) The dream most women have - The husband. Some kids. A house. A happy life. True love.4.) Everything a man does is filtered through his title (who he is), how he gets that title (what he does), and the reward he gets for the effort (how much he makes). These three things are all that make up the basic DNA of manhood.5.) As a woman, you will know if a man is serious about you once he claims you (like you are piece of luggage at the airport or something I guess?)6.) Women are either someone's lady, someone's daughter, or someone's mother. Not ever someone.7.) It is considered noble and wonderful if we women sit out something we enjoy doing if our man can't do that thing because then he couldn't protect us if something happened. 
  You guys, I'm only up to Chapter 3 so far.
8.) Men will occasionally cook and/or help out with household chores if there is a reward in it.9.) For some reason, ""the Smithsonian"" needs to be hyphenated as ""the Smith-sonian"".10.) Sex is always referred to as ""the goodies"", ""a reward"", or my favorite ""the cookie"". And it is basically the biggest reason any man would want to be with you or stay with you. You better not have an off couple of weeks unless you just gave birth (that's the example he gave for an acceptable reason not to give up the cookie).11.) What is wrong with you for thinking your boyfriend or husband wants to talk to you? ""That's what your girlfriends are for."" Because ""women love to sit and talk for no apparent reason but to talk"".12.) The perfect woman - ""capable of interesting conversation (which contradicts the above), you cook a mean breakfast, you hand out backrubs like sandwiches, you're independent (which means, to him, that you're not going to be in his pockets)"". That last part contradicts something else later on. 13.) It is the woman's fault if her man is a mama's boy because she hasn't told him not to be.14.) It is usually the woman's fault that men are cheaters.15.) Have standards and communicate those standards, but word them so that his fragile ego doesn't take a hit.16.) A man who is an athiest or agnostic has no moral barometer to make him even consider being loyal.17.) Vaginas are like insurance benefits that shouldn't kick in until a man has proven himself for 90 days.18.) Women should pretend that they can't move furniture or fix a broken sink so that men are clear that women need them. 19.) Independent women are lonely. 20.) Steve Harvey is a terrible human being.It is sexist, misogynistic crap. And honestly, men should be livid that people like Steve are out there saying that men are basically egotistical walking impulses with no discretion, no thoughts, no nurturing instincts, minimal care for their partner's hopes and dreams and needs unless that partner makes his life perfect and easy, and of very little value except for what he brings home and what he can do in bed. I know most men are better than this. I hope most men are better than this. Now I need to go take a shower and wash this funky grossness off me.",249,45
6023056,Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment,Sara,30,14,1,"March 5, 2012","This book actually angered me quite a bit. It's a one-sided critique hammering away that women aren't happy in relationships because they are doing something wrong. It assumes that women are the ones who need to change in order to be happy in a relationship, as if men were perfect in their existence, and it is women who are still struggling to achieve that same level of perfection. Even when Harvey discusses men who treat women like dirt and use them for sex, he turns it around on women, claiming that it's the woman's behavior that caused the man to treat her that way - men are above fault and blame.There are so many double standards in the book it was disturbing. I think Harvey would have been happier had he come to age in the 50s when women were expected to do nothing more than put rollers in their hair, cook and change diapers. This book basically assumes that it is the woman who needs to adjust her expectation regarding what a relationship should consist of as if she have no right to demand what it is that she wants in a relationship and a partner. ""Lower your expectations, change your behavior ladies!,"" Harvey implies, ""because men aren't going to change and they must be right, so you have to do all the work!"" If all men are as Harvey describes them I'll just stay single.",108,5
6023056,Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment,Ziyanda Xaso,30,51,1,"March 10, 2012","I'm actually going to review this book as I read it. I actually find it very simplistic in dealing with relationships. Steve here deems men to be simple creatures who are all basically the same regardless of upbringing, culture or creed. He makes some really sweeping assumptions about both men and women. The fact that he assumes that all men are running some sort of game on us women tells me that he really does not have a broad view of people. To me the book sounds like the advice that a father gives to his girl child before he allows her to go on dates with guys, just to make sure that she is not duped into sleeping with them. I must say the book is an extremely easy read as I was able to finish it within 24hours. But honestly towards the end I was really tired of the advice that Steve is dishing out. I’m honestly surprised that this book has made it to the best seller list and I guess it’s a testament as to how desperate we are as women to try and have successful relationships with these men. It is really sad to think that so many women are desperately seeking solutions in dealing with their relationships to no avail.Now back to my review of the book, really the best thing about it is the fact that it is such an easy read and that you really don’t spend that much time getting through it. Which in itself is a blessing as honestly the advice does become a bit tedious towards the end. Really the whole book is a bit of a big joke and looking at it from that perspective makes reading it bearable.Obviously not everything he says in the books is trash but in the same breath he really does not delve much deeper into the subject. The classic mistake he makes is in assuming that all men are the same and all women are looking for the same things in relationships. Mind you there is an audience for this book, narrow as it may be. But following everything he says in this book to the letter will really reduce your relationship to a game instead of something in which two grown intelligent people are building.In terms of the advice it all sounds like the advice that a father will give to his daughter before she goes out on her first date. And this is evident when Steve retells the incident between his father in law and one his daughter's dates. It’s all the warning that a father will give his daughter to make sure that the men out there don't take advantage of her and use her for sex. Some of this advice might apply to a teenager getting to grips with the opposite sex. But once you reach a certain level of wisdom and maturing really the game playing is out of the question.The fact that he assumes that as women we have no idea what some men are after really belittles our intelligence. Of course we know and sometimes it is exactly the same thing that we are after, sex. I just find the book a little condescending towards wise and experienced women because in all honesty if I have to run a game on you, in order to get you, then maybe we should not even be doing this thing.",74,8

6023056,Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment,Miranda,6,11,1,"March 7, 2013","I'm sorry to say this, but this book is a JOKE. The first half of the book, it acted like it was talking to smart women, telling women what drives men and how to make your man feel like a man. Then the second half was talking to dumb, easy girls, making sure they have standards for themselves and don't be clinging to a guy who has other women hanging on his other arm. It didn't flow into ""this is what you need to do next"" from the beginning. Another thing he does, is has women making lists of how she wants her man to be! Every girl in her right mind who has read a good relationship book knows not to make a ""list"" about what her ""dream"" man is. It's such unrealistic expectations to say you want a 100% gorgeous, funny, smart man. Here's an example of how he's not clear: ""And if we can't exercise two of the major components that make up who we are as men—providing and protecting—then we're not about to profess our love for you."" THEN he says, ""Don't give up your money, or your job, or your education, or the pride and dignity that come with all of that. Just be a lady."" Women will NEED to give up their pride in order to have a healthy relationship. Another thing: He's not very clear on which side of the board he's on for ANY points. For instance, he expects a woman to take care of her family, take care of her husband, keep a clean house, cook, let the man provide and protect, etc. yet he says men like women who are independent and don't ""reach in his pockets"" and ""it's a necessity for both the husband and the wife to work to make ends meet"", and then ""most men would not have a problem with his woman staying home."" And then in the Q&A section, he says ""most men who really care about you won't think anything of (women asking for money) if they have it."" ??? Which is it? Is she a ""gold digger"" or ""relying on her man""?! And then, he wants them to wear heels on top of all this (in the Q&A section he even says that he doesn't know a single man who prefers women in flats and ""If we could get athletic shoes with heels for women, we would!"") I personally believe that for me, as a woman, my place will be in the home, and my future husband's place is providing for the family. These are natural human instincts, like he mentioned before about the man wanting to provide. Why make it more confusing than it is?!I hate to bring up this issue, but he comes off as racist. All his examples are of ""black character"", I guess you could say. Talking about ""gold diggers"" and ""mama's boys"" and the like. Me, being white, can't relate to the examples of these black women. Another thing: he says a woman needs to have her man say this to her: ""When I don't see you, I miss talking to you, I always wonder what you're doing and whenever you come around, I just feel better—you're the type of woman I've been trying to find."" And he goes on to say, ""In other words, his answer has to make you feel wonderful. He may not be in love with you just yet, but he's crazy about you and he's probably thinking he wants to explore a long-term commitment with you..."" He has to explain himself on everything because he is not clear. He has no examples of good, healthy marriages in this book, to prove his point. It's all on a whim and what he believes. He puts all men in one category and it proves absolutely nothing. I think this book emasculates men! His relationship story with his wife doesn't convince me that he has good advice! What man says ""I'm going to marry you someday!"" when she walks into the room? I told my brother (who is 19!) about the things in this book and he agreed with me! Steve Harvey is a confusing male and doesn't have business writing a ""self-improvement"" book. I do think it's great that he advises to lay your expectations of a relationship out on the table and not to have sex for 90 days. Couples who want sex before they really know each other need to take the time to get to know each other first, but isn't this a pretty obvious point? I also like how he advises women to re-word what they're trying to say to their man to make him feel like man. We're wired different and communicate different. After telling women they need to act like a lady, he says this: ""This ""If he wants to marry me, he'll ask me"" thing has got to stop. Because we're not going to ask you when you're ready—we're going to play with you until you give us your requirements and standards and stand by them. I'm not telling you to get on bended knee. I'm telling you to set a timeline for the ring and the date, and tell the man you want to married to what it is."" Talk about pushy! Every woman knows that if you've talked to your man about marriage and he hasn't made a move, chances are, he's not ready! Whatever happened to the beginning of the book where he said men cheat because they haven't found out who they are yet? Well, chances are, he's not giving you a ring because he hasn't found out who he is. In the Q&A section, a question asks ""What do men think of women who buy drinks?"" and he says ""It's a total come-on. In our mind, if you want to buy us a drink, you want us. And if we think you want us, well, we're coming in for the kill."" Really? So scratch all that talk about a guy's instincts to pursue a woman and chase her? Anybody wanting a true relationship book shouldn't read this. The only reason I wanted to finish it was to say I finished it all the way through (in case, at the end, he says ""just kidding!"") and to make a review on here. I wouldn't really say it was a waste of time though, because I got to see what men NOT to marry. Go read Dr. Laura. She tells of true, healthy relationships! ;)",34,5

I know----the title should have clued me in, but a friend highly recommended it and I fell for it. Suffice it to say, most of the men I know do not think like this man. None of the women I know act like the ladies in this book. For example, Mr. Harvey describes the concept that men have a need to protect their wives, and uses the following illustration. His wife likes to scuba dive but he doesn't. They go somewhere with a group tour on a boat. His wife dons gear and goes underwater. He becomes nervous and threatens to kill everyone on the boat if anything happens to his wife. His wife returns safely but she gives up diving because she can see it makes him nervous. She's not angry. In fact, she says, ""Thanks for caring, honey."" funnnneeeee! ",21,13

Seriously. I mean, they took it personally. That only made me want to get through it faster to see what the hell Steve was telling because men were nervous. The first part of this book reads like a relationship manual from 1950. I understand where he's coming from, but I couldn't relate. My mind doesn't work that way. A friend of mine agreed that it did sound a little bit dateed, but she also said ""it gets better."" It did. I love the part encouraging women to ""get some standards."" It's sad that people need to be told that but, obviously, they do. I'm glad to hear a man say it. But, it is also kind of sad that Harvey sets up men as these brainless little creatures who will only act right if you make them. I just can't believe that is true. Sure, there are people who will try to get away with whatever you're willing to let them get away with. I get that. But surely, SURELY, there are some men out there who don't need to be put in check from the starting line. Surely there are some men out there who have standards of their own and don't need you to dictate yours in order to act accordingly. All of that said, it was an entertaining book and a quick read. I would recommend it to people who are interested, but take it, like any other ""self help"" book, with a salt shaker.",20,4
6023056,Act Like a Lady Think Like a Man What Men Really Think About Love Relationships Intimacy and Commitment,ريحانة,127,121,1,"August 26, 2016","From the title, I expected the book to explore the wonders of the human brain and explain the difference between males and females. After I finished the book, however, I couldn't remember anything related to the idea presented in the title. The author quoted it once, or maybe twice, without explaining his point any further.I was very irritated by the author's style and language. He's definitely not a professional writer. If this was an e-book, the style would have gone unnoticed. But for a book, it's too casual and extremely redundant.Basically, I see this book as a description of the author and his experience in dating his (second?) wife Marjorie, who was a single mother back then. In this description, Harvey refers to himself as ""we"" and ""all men"", and refers to his lady as ""you"" and ""all women"". Would everything he said apply to every single man and woman out there? Absolutely not!According to the author, men are very, very simple creatures, whereas women are irrational beings, feeling happy one moment, and going completely crazy the following minute.(...)Now, the part that made me want to throw the book against the wall (but I didn't, because I was reading on the iPad) was about cheating.Here is why men cheat according to Harvey:1) Because they can.2) Because it's the wife's fault.3) Because other women are willing to be with married men.But wait, don't get mad just yet. Cheating means nothing for a man. No, no. Rest assured ladies. It only means that you are not giving him the ""cookie"", so he went looking for it elsewhere. But it means absolutely nothing, because you know what? You are still the lady of his heart of hearts.Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!! Right?NO!I definitely don't recommend this book at all.I believe it was popular only because the author promoted it on his successful radio show. If the author gives this same advice on his show, then I can't imagine why it's successful. I just can't.",19,4

  I've learned so much out of this book !
It was really amazing to discover the way men think. They're so simple & straightforward creatures.You should understand that their love isn't like yours! They love through professing, protecting & providing. They want in return your support, loyalty and the cookie.I recommend this book for every woman just to know how to handle stuff form the manhood's point of view.The writer's language is so simple & you can finish the book so fast but it'd be better to read it slowly to swallow every single information!:)",12,29
