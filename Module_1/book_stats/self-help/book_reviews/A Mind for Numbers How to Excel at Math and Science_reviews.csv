   Luck favors the one who tries.
When I started reading it I never expected it to be this good. I was amazed and delighted to find this book to be exceptionally good. I have learned, which as it feels I had forgot , how to 'Learn to Learn'. It had shown me my flaws. It has shown me I was trying too hard, that it is 'easy that does it'. She starts with learning modes, that we have two important modes of thinking, focused-mode and diffused-mode. Focused-mode are highly attentive states which are limited to pre frontal cortex and diffused-modes are diffused throughout the brain. Only one mode can be active at a time. Focused mode is related to logical, sequential, analytical process. As soon as you concentrate on some thing , you are in focused mode. Whereas, when you are not concentrating, when you let your mind just wander, you are in diffused mode. Diffused mode is related to bigger-picture. Focused mode brings you the BRICKS and diffused mode is the MORTAR.To be attentive and try hard to get the problem inside your head is done by focused mode. Diffused-mode actually works in background under the layer of conscious awareness (and it is not that can ON and OFF, its always On whenever you are not concentrating,diffuse mode happens when you relax). Now she asserts that the learning happens when you toggle between these two modes. And then there is Einstellung effect: It refers to getting stuck in solving a problem or understanding a concept as a result of becoming fixated on a flawed approach. Switching modes from focused to diffuse can help free you from this effect. This made me a little more flexible regarding my thinking, and more patient too. And I've also found that sometimes initial ideas about problem solving can be very misleading. To figure out new ideas and solve problems, its important not only to focus initially, but also to subsequently turn our focus away from what we want to learn.In subsequent chapters the author deals with: * The problems of procrastination and how to deal with it. There were four chapters dedicated for it. (And it was here I found myself, a little, dragging the book).* Memory and how to enhance it. I remember one technique known as Memory Palace which was similar to Mind Palace shown in Sherlock TV series. It was here, once again, that I gained many insights which proved to be useful.* In the last chapters she gives miscellaneous tips and tricks for enhancing your learning and sculpting your brain.......................................................................The central theme of this book is the paradoxical nature of learning. Focused attention is indispensable for problem solving, yet it block our ability to solve problems. Persistence is key, but it can also leave us unnecessarily pounding our heads. Memorization is a critical aspect of acquiring expertise, but it can also keep us focused on the trees instead of forest. Metaphor allows us to acquire new concepts, but it can also keep us wedded to faulty conceptions. Our desire to figure things out right now is what prevents us from being able to figure things out. Reshaping your brain is under your control. The key is patient persistence: working knowledgeably with your brain's strengths and weaknesses. We can achieve startling insights into how to understand more simply, easily, and with less frustration: By understanding your brain's default settings- the natural way it learns and thinks, and taking advantage of this knowledge one can become an expert.HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS!",292,21
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,David Rubenstein,801,2504,4,"September 26, 2015","I first heard of this book from an online course given by the author, Barbara Oakley. The course is called ""Learning how to Learn"", and you can find it at coursera.Despite the title of the book, most of the advice here is appropriate for just about any subject. It is especially appropriate for subjects with concepts that might be difficult to grasp. And the book is most definitely geared toward students. There are highlights and questions at the end of each chapter, to reinforce the key points.There is a useful chapter on how to prepare for tests, and how to take tests. The advice is not always intuitive, but it is all common sense. Study groups are often beneficial. There are some situations, where they may be a waste of time.Much of the advice in the book is based on common sense. Don't cram for exams; study some each day, and don't overdo it. Lots of advice on how to make sure that you really understand the concepts. Re-reading material and highlighting key phrases is NOT very beneficial. Make up your own test questions, put them on flash cards with answers on the back. Flash cards are your friends. The book is filled with anecdotes and stories about educators, students, scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. These stories help make the book engaging, where otherwise it would be rather dry and uninteresting.The main theme of the book is that there are two modes of thinking; focused and diffuse. Focused thinking is what you do when you concentrate very hard to solve some problem. You need to remove yourself from distractions during focused thinking, and you probably should only perform focused thinking for a short amount of time; 25 minutes is recommended. Diffuse thinking, however, is somewhat more relaxed and actually creative. This kind of thinking allows your mind to wander in search of ""out of the box"" solutions to problems.If you are a student or even studying some subject on your own, then this book could be very helpful.",158,10
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Moeen Sahraei,29,23,4,"May 20, 2021","I had always been frightened by mathematics since I was a child. In high school all of my grades were A or B but the highest grade i had achieved in math was D. This trend was continuing until three years ago, when I had to learn maths in order to pass the exam in university. At first I was baffled with algebra, geometry, trigonometry and most of all calculus. It was a total nightmare for me. So I realized that I had to triumph over my fear and learn it properly once and for all. I started to watch khan academy videos on any math subjects.This was an epic moment in my life because I found out that my greatest fear was indeed my true passion in life. I just loved the harmony and beauty of algebraic expressions and calculus formulas especially the meaning behind all of these abstract symbols. With intuitive method of teaching of the khan academy and some mental exertion I managed to learn so many precious things in maths even difficult parts of calculus and I got an A in my AP exam. Since three years ago I have never stopped learning mathematics (except few months for TOEFL) and currently I am studying for the GRE test. Which I am really thrilled by this process and it is not stressful anymore at all. The most important thing is that I’ve decided to keep learning maths for the rest of my life, especially probability and statistics. That was my personal experience. But about the book. It is a really good guide for anyone who has similar difficulties regarding math and science. And even it is so helpful for people who are good at math, it could help them get better. The author herself had been so terrible at math until she saw better job opportunities in scientific disciplines like engineering, so she learned some important principles which helped her start learning math when she was 26, she got a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering, a master in computer engineering, and finally a doctorate in system engineering. In her insightful book she collected and explained those principles. She also relate some stories of other people who had the same experiences and how they got successful in this path, and she adds some advice from math and science professors.",103,8
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Always Pouting,568,677,3,"October 6, 2020","I have read a few of these books at this point, I bought a bunch of them when I was on my productivity kick, so a lot of the information was things I already knew. I do think just knowing what to do isn't enough, it's very much the execution that ends up being the issue. That said I think this is one of the better ones. Some of the ideas are repetitive but it's clearly done intentionally to help anyone reading the book internalize those ideas, which is probably really important if this is someone's first time encountering these things. I do also think the advice is solid and the book delivers it in an accessible and easy to internalize fashion. Probably a good book for anyone that doesn't have the best habits or relationship with long term sustained learning, including myself. Mostly its been useful as I've been studying to help get me into a place where I find it easier to do my work. It kind of serves to prime me for what I need to do which helps with execution and maybe I can try to sustain this by replacing reading books on how to be efficient with just journaling and trying to be more mindful of my behavior.

18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Chazzle,268,13,2,"February 8, 2015","Probably some of the advice in the book is good. I just wasn't in the target audience. I like math, I'm very good at math, and this book is for those who struggle. I liked Paul Lockhart's book ""A Mathematician's Lament"" much, much better. In that one, he really makes you want to DO math, to DISCOVER mathematical truth, to LOVE math. In Barbara Oakley's book, she teaches you how to ""get by"", and maybe even ""get an A"". Much, much less inspirational. Where's the fun? Where's the love?",35,2
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Stephan ,32,40,5,"April 4, 2017","Fantastic learning hacks! How our brain works concerning learning, retaining. Everyone should read this, every pupil/student in school.We learn all our lives and sometimes we have exams - this book will tell you how to prepare well. The title ""A Mind for Numbers"" is misleading, it's about learning in general. ",28,N/A
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Mark Bao,29,222,3,"June 30, 2016","tl;dr: Read if you want to learn general study skills, skip if you're interested in skills specifically for math/science.Why did the author write a book about getting better at numbers and math and science and not really talk specifically about how to get better at math and science? This book is 90% about general study skills with lackluster tie-ins to how it might work with math/science. Don't go into this thinking you'll learn stuff specific to math/science – you'll be disappointed.As an introductory book to study skills, it's not too bad, though it's overshadowed by more compelling books that specifically talk about general study skills like Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning and Cal Newport's books. Many of the productivity and study tips it mentions are good, but they fall into the classic non-fiction personal development book trap of telling you some common-sensical thing you should be doing and adding an anecdote in there. It's OK if it's common-sense advice, but it's not really that useful if it's common-sense advice without much follow-through information on how to implement that advice.Maybe it's just me. Admittedly, I've read a lot about productivity and study skills so most of this was a reminder at best, boring repetition at worst. If you've read books like Make It Stick or Cal Newport's books and want to get a more math- and science-focused advice on how to do better, don't pick this up. If you've read some but aren't sure, maybe pick up the audio version (which is what I did). Or go to a bookstore, skim through, and decide from there.It's not that there aren't gems in this book. There are a few. Diffuse mode vs. focused mode thinking, a core part of the book, is pretty interesting. The fact that the memory palace technique works well for unrelated things, which I never thought about. And some other ones that weren't so memorable. It's good for reminding you about all the productivity tips that you should be doing. But for me, there was nothing novel in here.I'm not sure what I'll read next to replace this. Here are some that I'm considering, if you're curious:• What Is Mathematics?: An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods• How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method• How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics• The Princeton Companion to Mathematics",24,N/A
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Tereza Hladíková,23,6,1,"August 13, 2016","I didn't like the way Barbara repeats over and over the same agruments for nearly trivial statements. For example she was able to write about 30 pages only about the fact that you need to sleep and relax in order to enhance your learning. For me, it seems like a 1000-year-old advice but she kept repeating it as if I haven't read it already 16 times before in this chapter. The entire book could be summarized in 5 pages. Although I must admit that I surely enjoyed reading her life story, about how she approached the math and the science which was in the beginning of the book.",13,1 comment
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Albert,347,43,4,"January 4, 2021","Oh my. I wish I had read this in High School or between High School and College or in College. This book is less about Math and Science and more about learning and studying. There are certainly some techniques that are specific to or a better fit for Math and Science, but most of the ideas and material will work for almost any area of study. Many of the recommendations were not new to me. I had used quite a few of them throughout my years as a student and learner. The real insight came from the overall package, putting the techniques together and most importantly, finding ways to use them persistently and with discipline. Developing the techniques and organizational methods as a complete skillset was not something I ever really accomplished. I would use a few techniques in this class and a few others in this other one, but I lacked consistency. I also lacked the discipline. My intentions were always worthy, but my execution was lacking. I would like to think I could give this book to a high school student today and they would get the benefit I missed, but I am afraid only a small percentage of those students would take the time to review the book much less read it. Even today, I see opportunity to use what I have found in this book. As I attempt to learn something new as an adult, as I take on a new project, the opportunity is there. But first I must put aside all the opportunity missed so that I can focus on the opportunity in front of me.",12,N/A

18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,Bryn,27,1 follower,5,"January 1, 2015","A fantastic book for understanding how we best learn complex concepts. Initially I thought because I already have college degrees in Math and CS that I didn't need to read this book. I though I already knew how to learn match and science. I was wrong.In retrospect, the subjects and classes that came easily to me were the classes in which I was practicing many of the good habits prescribed in this book. The subjects in which I struggled, were plagued by many of the bad habits and pitfalls outlined by Dr Oakley. In fact, I have resolved to revisit some of those subjects that proved difficult in school using these techniques. The book is written at a very easy reading level, making it very approachable for readers as young as 12. I will be testing this theory by making this book required reading for my kids before they start middle school. This is the companion book to the Coursera course taught by Dr Barbara Oakley. https://www.coursera.org/course/learning",11,N/A
18693655,A Mind for Numbers How to Excel at Math and Science,John,30,5,5,"January 26, 2015","A Mind for Numbers is a worthy addition to the ""owner's manual for the brain"" genre. It's billed as a description of how people who did not do well in math or science in school can learn to effectively study topics within those fields.As someone who did well in math and science in school, this book reminded me of many successful study habits, some cultivated on purpose and some by accident during my preprofessional academic career. The book also has some great ideas that run counter to the conventional wisdom (in this case, foolishness) of our day. I'll list these separately:Good study habits: - Building my ability to memorize scripts, movies, jokes, etc. (on purpose: I still love quoting things) - Not cramming (accidental: I never had the need, though I procrastinated on projects) - Reviewing before bed (on purpose, but only for subjects I was particularly interested in) - Reading ahead (on purpose, but driven by annoyance at how similar arithmetic lessons were from grades 1 through 3) - Focusing on the edge of my understanding rather than burning study time on mastered material (on purpose: I didn't like ""studying,"" so why would I waste ""study"" time on stuff I already knew?) - Teaching others (on purpose: helping someone understand new concepts makes you feel like a boss) - Paraphrasing (accidental: I never enjoyed the physical act of writing longhand, so I was often annoyed by any hint of verbosity in definitions or descriptions. I actually got in trouble once for not copying sections of my science textbook's glossary verbatim for an assignment!) - Joking about the material (accidental: you have to have a sense of humor) - Interleaving material (accidental: it just felt right. I never thought of myself as ""studying"" because ""studying"" was something that was supposed to feel miserable. I did my homework and I reviewed the syllabus before tests.)Good ideas: - Creativity is retrieving from long-term memory something that was never there - The necessary ping-pong between the brain's focused and diffuse modes - It's not a coincidence that we experience ""aha!"" insights when we step away from a problem we've been working hard for a while. Harness this phenomenon. - Memorization as critical to creativity and effective problem-solving. This is a big one for two reasons: 1. Some nonsense started getting popular around the turn of the 21st century that knowing facts is inconsequential so long as you know where to find them. 2. Memorization assignments fell out of fashion since they're confused with rote-learning. In fact, perfect memorization of longer scenes is *only* possible by ""chunking"" the details into an outline of overall concepts.",10,N/A

I wanna read this book over and over and over again! But actually, that is something this book told me not to do… The struggle is real!This is an excellent book for everyone who struggles with math. It doesn’t matter if it’s a 7-year old’s problem with multiplication tables or a physics master student trying to understand thermodynamics in quantum systems. This is also a great book for everyone trying to learn anything new in their life. I am convinced that the majority of people would take a benefit in their personal and professional life from reading this book.I can’t say that every concept in this book was completely mind-blowing and new to me, but Barbara Oakley manages to explain why things that have worked for you for years are actually excellent learning strategies. This book also inspired me to use my planner more and it had a positive effect on my self-esteem (especially before and during exams). I am completely sure that, would I go through this book again, I’d notice advice that I haven’t put to practice yet and I’m planning to implement more of it to my life.
