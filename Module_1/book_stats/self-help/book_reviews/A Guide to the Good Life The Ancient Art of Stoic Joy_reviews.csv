5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,Amir Tesla,161,655,5,"July 1, 2021","Recommended to: If you are interested in applying philosophical views and wisdom to your life and if you value tranquility and inner peace above all.What this book is about: The author William Irvine who is a professor of philosophy at Wright State University after having read through many philosophy schools from Zen Buddhist to Cynics and Stoics has come into conclusion that living a stoic life is worth pursuing due to its promising benefit which is tranquility and joy. He has thus compiled teachings of great Stoics from Seneca to Marcus Aurelius and tailored them to suit the modern days.Pros:Author has provided well organized, practical bits of advice which are the essence of Stoic philosophy from negative visualization to practicing self-discipline through self-denial.Also, he has made a decent contribution on portraying an actual picture of what Stoicism is really about. Cons:Franky I saw no use of the last chapter, it had no relevance to a guide to a good life and it wasn't a short chapter believe me and the contents were advocation of stoic philosophy which he had done already in previous chapters very well. Selected synopsis:A potent way of confronting a disturbing situation is the use of negative visualization, namely, imagining what would happen if you lost your dear possessions, be it your car, house, or even your beloved. It argues that by doing so you come to appreciate your belonging far more than those who take things for granted.---Internalize your goals: A beautiful piece of advice. It says that we must focus our attention on what we have full or partial control on, not the things we have no control over. For example, if you have a tennis match, don't set your goal on being the winner, because if you fail, you will lose your tranquility and become utterly upset, instead, make your goal to practice and play at highest level possible which in turn can have the added value of winning the match.---What upsets people is not things themselves but their judgments about these things.---What point is there on ""being unhappy"", just because once you were unhappy...---We can easily replace out feelings of regret at having lost something with feelings of thanks for once having had it. ---Reason, is the best weapon against grief. Unless reason puts an end to our tears, fortune will not do so. ---If we seek social status, we give people power over us: since we have to do things calculated to make them admire us and we will have to refrain from doing things that will trigger their disfavor.---To retain inner peace, focus on what you have control on, It's foolish to concerns ourselves with what we can't control like when the sun rises or when a dear person to us might die.---Vices are contagious: They spread, quickly and unnoticed, from those who have them to those with whom they come into contact.",103,11
5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,B. Rule,787,20,3,"June 7, 2012","This book gets 5 stars for subject, 2 stars for execution. The Stoics themselves are fascinating and every quote is a gem. However, the author doesn't trust the ancient Stoics to carry the argument. Instead, his account is a series of straw man arguments (""you might think that a Stoic would eat babies, but there's another reading..."" Not quite that bad but almost.). Further, when he gets to the section on updating Stoicism for the modern world, the section where he has to do the heavy lifting by himself, he has a failure of nerve or a bout of laziness or both. It turns into a hypothetical argument (""if one were to argue, one would start by describing how evolution supports Stoicism..."" but he never actually makes the argument!) ""One"" should go ahead and make his argument, rather than totally copping out with a sketch of an idea. I was predisposed to like this book given the subject, but I was left wishing for a far better treatment. The Stoics deserve better. ",56,N/A
5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,Moeen Sahraei,29,23,5,"November 1, 2021","Have you ever thought about how we can live a happy life? Most people are thinking about it on daily basis and indeed it has been one of the greatest human concerns throughout history. Nowadays we can hardly find anyone to answer this question properly even the best philosophers are occupied with some other branches of philosophy such as logic, ethics, epistemology and ...But about more than 2000 years ago there were philosophers whose main job was to teach “philosophy of life”, which refers to a comprehensive guide regarding how we should live in order to be happy and satisfied in our lives and how to alleviate or even eliminate all negative emotions such as anger, grief, anxiety, depression etc. The importance of having a philosophy of life is that if we don’t have a proper philosophy we might waste our precious life pursuing things that are not worth pursuing and attaining things that are not worth attaining. In other words, at the end of the life we might find out that we didn’t live a good life and we have just wasted it in haphazard way. Having A philosophy of life enables us to know the true value of everything we encounter and be aware of what we should focus on and what we should ignore. So, because of this importance there were schools in which great Greek philosophers taught their philosophy of life. Among them one of the most prominent and marvelous schools was the schools of “stoics”. They were great philosophers and psychologists who obtained a remarkable wisdom regarding how to get rid of negative emotions and consequently; live a happy life. The stoics asserts that the important goal in life is achieving “Tranquility”. By tranquility they mean a life without or with little negative emotions like anger and anxiety, and have a tranquil state of mind. They also thought that we can achieve tranquility by living a “virtuous” life. According to stoics, a virtuous person is one who performs well the function for which humans were designed. For example, a virtuous hammer is one that drive nails properly. So for what function were people designed?? To answer this question the stoics thought we need only examine ourselves. On doing so, we will discover that we Have the ability to reason and we differ from other animals in this respect, so a virtuous person should be reasonable. Other natural characteristics of human are the same. For example we are naturally social creatures, so we have duties to our fellow men. In sum, stoics claim that if we live virtuous( in conformity with nature) we will reach tranquility and as a result, we will live a happy and satisfied life.The author of this book is a proficient writer and he explained stoics theories in the best way possible. He focuses of practical aspects of stoics literature and explains their psychological techniques in a way that is so useful in everyday life. He also adds stoic sage’s advices about some important aspects of life such as how to treat in our social life, how to respond when we hear an insult, what should be attitude towards fame or fortune, and etc. I highly recommend this book to all sorts of readers, the least benefit of this book is that it will definitely help you to enhance your mental state.",39,N/A
5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,Krishna Chaitanya,68,122,4,"August 29, 2020","If someone asks me why am I living and what is the purpose in life? then I don't have an answer. In pursuit of improving myself and better quality of life, I started reading self-help books and I've stumbled on Stoic mentions in other books on various occasions and thus I picked this one to learn about stoicism and this one is wonderful beginner book to become a practising stoic.Why is it important to have a philosophy of life? If not we might unintentionally lead a bad life and on death bed we contemplate and regret that we have lead a bad life and did not accomplish anything substantial.The purpose of practicing stoicism is to attain tranquility, this book helps you by providing teachings of Ancient stoics like Seneca, Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus and others. Towards the end of this book, as a practicing stoic, the author advices on practicing stoicism and how it would be helpful for you in this modern world.Stoicism teachings are not easy to follow, they are very difficult to practise. If you're planning to practice stoicism then the author strongly recommends to keep it a secret to avoid discouragement and humiliation from others.Few of the teachings I remember are:1 - Negative imagination: This is a tough one, stoics tell that by practicing negative imagination, we don't take the people or things we value most for granted.E.g., If you value your house more, then imagine it is on fire, such that if the time comes you'll be able to cope with that disaster.Practising negative imagination for sometime in a day helps us to be more affectionate with our loved ones.2 - Dealing with insults: Insults either direct or indirect cannot be avoided, in your career or in your personal life. Stoics tell us respond to insults with silence and much better with self-deprecating humour by this we'll become more immune to insults.3 - About control: Do not worry about the things you cannot control like Weather or traffic and so on. Care only about the things which you have complete control like your goals and ambitions. If some cases you have partial control like a Tennis match you're playing, if you're adamant on winning the match, you might get disappointed and it disturbs your tranquility instead focus on giving the best you can.There's much more to learn from this book, it's worth giving it a try.",37,N/A
5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,Jeffrey,10,5,4,"January 18, 2009","There aren't many books written on a philosophy of life as there are 'philosophies' for life out there; and there aren't many books that exist in the great divide between academic philosophy and water-downed caricatures of philosophy (think Consolation of Philosophy but PART TWO...). Mr Irvine's book, however, provides one fairly detailed philosophy of life as Stoicism goes and bridges the divide by not only describing what is Stoicism but also, how to practice Stoicism for both tranquility and joy in the context of our insane and insatiable consumerist culture amid other existential fears and anxieties. Let me say this first: this is a timely book in view of the Financial Crisis of 2008 transforming into something Unknown and Monstrous for 2009 and beyond. Here, Mr Irvine's book contains not just sound advice for living amid hardship, but also useful tidbits of wisdom in the face of calamity and unrest. But as the Fates would have it, it may be all good but a tad too late. Even so, Mr Irvine's book is part self-reflection, part 'what is Stoicism' (and who the Stoics were), and part how to be a Stoic. If you find yourself immediately put off by the word 'Stoic', don't. Mr Irvine has done marvelously well on explaining why the modern interpretation of 'Stoic' has been more of a misinterpretation than the lived reality of a good life: his reflection of those mundanely trivial but existentially heroic accounts of his own life suffice. However, what I find singularly troubling is Mr Irvine's ambition in explaining Stoicism at an extremely high level of evolutionary psychology; that the Stoics techniques have been designed to short-circuit what might be the undesirable consequences of human evolution on ""autopilot"" to the ultimate demise of the human psyche and society (e.g. insatiable greed for security and an extreme one, an eye for an eye to ensure one stays as the Alpha Male for reproduction). But consistent to the claims of the evolutionary psychology one can also find himself inevitably suggesting that because Stoicism exists, it must have also been somewhat effective in increasing the chance for successful reproduction; that merely than short-circuiting anxieties, fears, greed and so on for 'short-term' tranquility, it also acts as a long term catalyst, if not a direct cause for successful reproduction. So is Stoicism a cure or a cause? Is it both? In trying to explain the causes of the symptoms Stoicism tries to cure via evolutionary psychology, Mr Irvine opens up new questions he was not prepared to answer. In fact, what I find most satisfying, and also where the philosophical lore is the richest, are those direct and honest accounts of living as a Stoic in today's world. For example, in one of Mr Irvine's account of changing a 16 year old car for a 9 year old 'new' one with neither a radio nor a cup-holder brought a smile to my face--indeed, why do we need three jumbo cup-holders and 8000 channels on our car radios today? By 'downgrading', Mr Irvine suggests (he would probably use the word, 'simplifying') our materialistic lives, we are in fact 'upgrading' in virtuous Stoical character-building. I think I see Mr Irvine nodding. Yet, Mr Irvine shies away from those difficult, pressing questions as the contemporary mouth-piece, if not a modern peer to philosophers like Seneca and Epictetus. Sure, one can see how a new Ferrari can disturb one's newfound Stoical tranquility and joy. But what if one is not choosing between a materialistic entity which works on the principle of decreasing marginal satisfaction (hence an increasing indifference, if not dissatisfaction ) and a virtuous good, but between two competing virtuous goods, for example, in being responsible to my children, spouse or parents and being responsible to the duties and commitments of the workplace? The ultimate good of both choices are no different than the Stoic version of the highest goods of tranquility and joy, yet one is often compelled to choose only one, assuming that an acceptable balance between the two means some compromise to this tranquility. To this ultimate competition of ultimate goods, Mr Irvine's Stoicism has nothing to say. This is not to say that Mr Irvine's account is a straw-man account. But very often, perplexities and anxieties in life has to do with the competition of virtuous goods, and not to the marginal acquisition of a Ferrari or a Renoir. Perhaps this was why Marcus Aurelius hastened his own death as a public servant-emperor, who most likely, had to choose between two competing goods as a Stoic. In addition, what about those who collect Ferraris and Renoirs so they can appreciate their beauty? Because Mr Irvine assumes that crass materialism has solely been undertaken for the envy of our neighbors, Mr Irvine also misses the point that a good number of 'materialists' out there can also be aestheticians. Sure, Stoicism dismisses connoisseurship, especially connoisseurship that overly commits one to dependency on luxury, Mr Irvine argued. But surely a Stoic would not dismiss the appreciation of beauty through materialism as a path to Stoic tranquility and joy, as one may collect humble stamps and common vases, or grow roses? Lastly, Mr Irvine's overall account tacitly position his interest in broadly speaking to a certain class of citizens in certain advanced capitalistic economies. Tacitly, I think he was speaking to the middle and upper middle class of the American society. I don't know if Marcus Aurelius or Seneca made that assumption, though both were reputably wealthy individuals who had SOMETHING they can imagine themselves losing and hence, feel content through the practice of negative visualization. But it is true that in the world today, there are many who have NOTHING to lose; that is, they are not even substantively well-off and have nothing but their own bodies to be exploited and harvested by others. To tell these folks about practising negative visualization is to also mock them. If so, does this demonstrate that Stoicism is a philosophy predicated upon the class structure? To some extent by the absence in Mr Irvine's depiction, yes. But since we know the classical Stoics were not unreasonable brutes, then we must commit to the possibility that something is lacking in Mr Irvine's modern account in an unreasonably unjust world. This, I suppose, would be up to the readers' own musing, for Mr Irvine has nothing to say to this regard. Indeed, what Mr Irvine fails to mention--and I think if he did, aptly in a time like this--is that personal tranquility and joy may be necessary but not sufficient for a Good Life. Unlike the Greeks or the Romans who blissfully lived their circumscribed spheres thinking that theirs was the known world, Moderns can no longer afford the luxury of a the Good Life based on a Personal notion without relating to the Others (who often do not have it so Good). What we seem to need today, if Stoicism is indeed the philosophical practice for the Good Life, is not only to deflect insult for insult; or to abandon crass materialism for character-building; or to be justly indifferent to external circumstances, but in fact, to broadly engage these external circumstances in a fast-deteriorating and destructively spiraling external world we all inhabit, Stoics and 'materialists' alike. Mr Irvine lamented the demise of Stoicism after the Empire; but likely is the possibility that its notion of the Good Life is limited when Others don't have it so good. Without such an engagement, even a Stoic may find it difficult to attain the Good Life.",28,1 comment
5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,Darryl,33,4,3,"March 7, 2014","This popular book won't be of much interest to those who have already read Seneca, Epictetus, Musonius Rufus, and Marcus Aurelius, or, indeed, to anybody who has read a solid introduction to their thought.Nor would it satisfy those looking for a clear and concise description of Stoic psychological techniques or 'exercises': for that, one might turn to ""Stoic Spiritual Exercises"" by Elen Buzare.However, the book may be of interest to those seeking an easy-to-digest introductory exposition of Stoic practice and ""philosophy of life"".Be warned, however, that Irvine's treatment of Stoic philosophy is a somewhat idiosyncratic interpretation. Irvine attempts to make Stoicism palatable for modern readers and applicable to their lives. In pursuing this end he may actually have, to some extent, distorted or misrepresented Stoicism. He points out, however, that he is writing to help people find a practical philosophy of life, not to please academics. He also points out that he is but one in a long line of interpreters of Stoic philosophy which stretches all the way back to the ancient world.""A Guide to the Good Life"" is a popular book and probably deserves its popularity: the proof of the pudding is, after all, in the eating. However, it wasn't of much use to me personally, hence only three stars.",25,1 comment
5617966,A Guide to the Good Life The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy,William2,728,2817,3,"May 16, 2012","This is a very practical guide to living well. Please don't let the grounding in philosophy put you off. The Stoics were the most useful of philosophers. What Irvine has done is to distill the teachings of Seneca, Epictetus, Musonius, Marcus Aurelius and the others into concise guidelines that can be applied to everyday life. No abstractions heaped on abstractions here. This is lively prose intended to instill a number of basic mental concepts that can bring tranquility--the overarching Stoic ideal--to our lives. A final section showing why Stoicism fell from popular favor and why we should integrate it into our lives is particularly interesting. Read it as an Introduction to the aforementioned authors, or as a refresher.",20,4
