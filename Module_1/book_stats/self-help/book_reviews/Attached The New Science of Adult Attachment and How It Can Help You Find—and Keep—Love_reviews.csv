9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Melody,293,65,2,"December 30, 2017","I'm convinced that all the 5 star reviews must be from anxiously attached people because this book offers nothing for anyone else lol. I knew something was up when the chapter dedicated to explaining anxious attachment was twice as long as the chapter dedicated to avoidant attachment. The glorification of anxious types only increased from there. The whole book is really filtered through an anxious lens.The little bit I learned about the importance of having a secure base and deactivation techniques and protest behavior was overshadowed by the negative way they portrayed people like me. Another reviewer mentioned subconscious bias and I have to agree. The authors are very sympathetic towards anxious types who are portrayed as victims throughout the whole book while avoidant types are portrayed as cold, selfish, and abusive. Secure types are put on a pedestal and declared naturally good at relationships. All readers are encouraged to stay FAR away from avoidant types which, as you can imagine, made me feel great as someone with an avoidant attachment style who only bought this book to learn more about avoidant attachment styles.It's interesting how the authors' bias limits this book. There are actually two avoidant types: dismissive and fearful. This book doesn't acknowledge either one. They're simply lumped together and that's that. Disorganized types (anxious & avoidant!) are mentioned like, once, and never revisited again. If their intent was to introduce all the attachment styles to a mainstream audience and explain how it can foster or inhibit loving relationships, they failed miserably.All of the stories/illustrations of couples are anxious/avoidant and the anxious person is good and the avoidant person is bad. When a secure person appears, they are good too and the anxious person is just misunderstood or behaving poorly - never a bad person. I happen to be an avoidant type dating an avoidant type, but the book swiftly dismissed and denied the existence of two avoidant people in a relationship. We're even at one point viewed by the authors as a scourge on the dating scene, making it harder for anxious people to find love. It's almost as if they can't imagine anything beyond anxious = good, avoidant = bad.A relationship with an avoidant type is seen by the authors as being inherently toxic because ""avoidants"" - as they refer to them in the book multiple times, funny how their isn't a similar pejorative for anxious types - do not want intimacy. This is not true, but this book doesn't even see avoidant types as worthy of understanding so I wasn't shocked that they would oversimplify in this way. There's actually A LOT of oversimplifying and generalizing that only serves anxious types.In all the stories the anxious one is usually a woman and the avoidant one is usually a man, even though they say attachment styles know no gender (eye roll). There was one gay couple I can remember, the rest are all hetero. No mention of race or class. There's one particularly long story about an anxious woman who dates and marries an abusive man, who is avoidant OF COURSE, and it serves as one giant cautionary tale for why anxious types are sympathetic angels and why ""avoidants"" are toxic to the bone. Again, a clear bias from the authors and not nearly enough research to back-up all the claims they make.My conclusion is that ""Attached"" is one big contradictory mess. Anxious types are told over and over that there is nothing wrong with them being co-dependent because that's just their natural need for intimacy and no one should shame them for that. HOWEVER, the authors don't acknowledge (or rather, they don't believe) that avoidant types emotional needs are just as valid or worthy of respect. Secure types are just wonderful from the jump, so there's no specific focus on them either.They make no effort to understand why avoidant types are the way they are. There's little sympathy for what an avoidant type wants and needs in a relationship. Avoidant types are actually encouraged to change where anxious types are told to don't settle for a partner that wants you to change. THEN both types are told that a secure type will make them better and that they should actively search for that person who will help transform them into a secure type. Cause it's your partner's job to make you secure. It's ridiculous.The authors cannot fathom that most people don't fit into these neat little boxes. Any relationship type that didn't align with the sparse amounts of research they referenced in this book was ignored or invalidated. It's actually alarming that these two people who seem to only communicate effectively about anxious and secure partnerships decided to write a book about ALL the attachment styles for mainstream audiences. Fail, fail, fail, fail.",823,82
9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Marissa,75,6,2,"February 8, 2012","Bleh. This book had a promising premise and while the underlying theory has some merit, I found the explanations too simplistic, and the examples too stark (almost caricature-like) to capture the nuances of human personalities and relationships. So, while the book had several “A-ha!” moments, the suggestions of what to DO with this information was lacking.Also, as someone who fell into the Secure/Avoidant category, this book was a let down. There was little acknowledgment that some (most?) people do not fit neatly into a box. While the authors were exceedingly sympathetic to Anxious types, and congratulatory of Secures, the recurring theme was that Avoidants are toxic, cold, emotionally unavailable, and generally crappy partners and everyone else should steer clear. Not really helpful or productive if you are somewhat/entirely Avoidant, particularly one who is proactive enough to pick up this book and read it in the first place.",361,16

9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Morgan Blackledge,551,1852,4,"May 6, 2018","The first (and maybe only) thing to understand about attachment theory, is that attachment is simply a fancy word for love. Plain and simple. Once you understand that, the rest of the theory makes perfect sense. The next thing to know is that our patterns of bonding and repairing are conditioned i.e. learned, beginning in relationship between caregivers and infants, and continuing into adulthood.The last thing to know is that our relational conditioning i.e. attachment style can be problematic, but it can also change for the better over time, particularly with intentional therapeutic work. And understanding attachment theory can be an instrumental part of that process of therapeutic change. So what exactly is attachment theory?I'm glad you asked.Attachment theory began in the 1940's as a way to describe patterns of infant and caregiver bonding. It is one of the first psychological theories to integrate evolutionary theory. As such, it represented a radical departure from the dominant psychological theories of the time e.g. Freudian and Behaviorist orientations. Attachment Theory survived (in part) due to its simplicity and profound explanatory power.The creators of attachment theory (John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth) posited that mammals (particularly humans) evolved the capacity to deeply, emotionally connect with their young due to the relatively long period of infant dependence, circa 50 years (and counting) if one were to use my case as an example. Attachment theory asserted that if mammals (particularly humans) and their young fail to bond (i.e. attach), than the young are very likely to not survive, and the parents would then have failed to pass on their genes. Based on this assertion, the theory predicts that (a) infants will feel distressed at separation from their primary care giver, and (b) the infants will be motivated to reduce the distress by seeking proximity and emotional attunement upon reunion. And this is of course the case, with some interesting caveats.Mary Ainsworth created an experimental paradigm known as The Strange Situation, that systematically distressed infants and toddlers by briefly separating them from their care giver, in order to observe their reunion behavior when the pair (typically mother and child) were eventually reunited. Strange situation researchers have determined that attachment behavior strategies can be generally classified in four categories. (1) Secure Attachment, in which the infant easily reconnects with care giver (2) Anxious Attachment, I which the infant is overly concerned or ""preoccupied"" with the task of getting the care givers attention, (3) Avoidant Attachment, in which the infant is unconcerned or ""dismissive"" of the task of getting the care givers attention, and (4) Disorganized Attachment in which the infant displays fearful, preoccupied and dismissive behaviors and lacks an ""organized"" attachment strategy. NOTE: The Disorganized style typically comes as a result of exposure to childhood trauma, neglect and or abuse and therefore occurs infrequently (around 2-5%) except for in low SES communities with high violent crime, or in war zones etc. where it is observed at a much higher rate.Later resurch found that (surprise surprise) people cary these attachment styles into their adult relationships, sometimes resulting in relational problems depending on which attachment styles are paired. The book particularly takes critical aim at couples in which an anxious pairs with an avoidant. I actually didn't ""need"" a book to tell me how bad those are, but it sure is nice to finally have some valid tools to deconstruct (and ideally defuse) toxic relationship patterns.Adult attachment theory is really fun and useful, to a point. And then it's use value breaks down necessarily due to it's simplicity. It's hard to imagine a 4 quadrant grid being able to entirely explain the rich complexity of human bonding.Maps are, out of necessity, simplifications. That's what makes them effective. Attachment theory is a fantastic map to the rocky, maze like terrane of human love and commitment, but it's important not to relate to the map as if it were the territory it's self. That being said. Try to find your way around Los Angeles with out a map. Maps are really really good things.I personally like to use a lot of maps. I like to supplement the attachment theory map with neuroscience (especially psychnuroendocrinology) Danieal Siegel does a good job of integrating the neuroscience with attachment theory for a broad popular audience. I love Robert Sapolsky's work too.For those new to adult attachment theory, this is pretty crucial reading. I'm unaware of any other popular treatment of the subject. Sue Johnson's Hold Me Tight covers some of the same ground, but is much more oriented towards explaining her particular take on couples therapy i.e. Emotion Focused Therapy (EFT) for couples. This book is more general, and (in my opinion) much more informative and helpful than Hold Me Tight.One of the things I loved (LOVED) about this book is it doesn't assume it's necessarily worthwhile to salvage every relationship. In fact, the authors attempt to inoculate the reader from certain fundamentally flawed pairings. Yes! I love the commonsensical message that breaking it off, or avoiding a bad one altogether may be the best move. I also love that the book is brief. Not overly brief, just direct and to the point. Lean and mean. Unlike this epic review ;)So anyway, read it. It's well done and chock full of useful life tools and insights. Well worth the price tag.",104,14
9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Wesley Fenza,92,5,2,"July 27, 2018","I was not a fan of this book. It has some good basic information about attachment styles, but it could have been communicated in about 20 pages. The rest of the book takes the form of advice on how to have fulfilling relationships, and it is saturated with the mononormative bias of the author. The traditional lifelong monogamous pair-bond, throughout the entire book, is held up as the shining pinnacle of relationships and is assumed to be everyone's goal. Any desire for autonomy is evidence of an avoidant attachment style and should be resisted. Ditto for any outside sexual interest (which is experienced by almost everyone). Codependence is encouraged as the mark of a secure attachment.There is also a clear favoritism toward a secure attachment style, which is to be expected as it is generally viewed as the healthiest style (and evidence supports this view). But there is also a favoritism toward anxious attachment style over avoidant. Partners of people with anxious attachment style are encouraged just to accommodate their partner's clinginess, constant need for reassurance, possessiveness, and jealousy, while partners of people with avoidant attachment style are encouraged to leave the relationship or else accept that they will never be completely happy. There is very little advice given on how to make an avoidant partner feel safe experiencing intimacy. Most advice regarding avoidant style is on how to change it.I was also unhappy with the presentation of each attachment style being unique to a person instead of unique to a relationship. That is not my experience of attachment styles. With some partners, I have a secure attachment style. With others, I can be anxious or avoidant. It's not because any one of these is my innate attachment style. It is because I am reacting to my partner's feelings and behavior. I have noticed this with other people also. My experience is that people do not have a discrete attachment style that gets implemented with every partner. My experience is that each *relationship* has a certain dynamic where each partner plays out one of the attachment styles, but that the exact same person can have a different attachment style in a different relationship.

It may be comforting for someone to affirm that being needy or aloof is just your attachment style, but you're doing yourself a disservice. As someone with a degree in psychology, I disagree with the conclusions the author draws from the research. An distant or anxious ""attachment style"" is an unhealthy way to approach relationships, and likely a sign that there are deeper issues to work through. The worst thing you can do is to put on one of their labels, and use that as an excuse not to take a deeper look at your actions. This is a harmful book that will mislead you on your quest for a healthy, loving relationship.",96,13

That IS exactly what happens! Someone else finally gets it!""It's a very heteronormative, monogamous book, so it was really interesting to read it through the polyamory lens. They put forward the idea that people can learn to become more ""Secure"" in their attachment. I hereby declare: if you want to become ""Secure,"" become polyamorous, and you'll be FORCED to figure your shit out.",68,12
9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Nadeem Ahmad,15,2,4,"March 17, 2016","Interesting read on the theory of adult attachments in romantic relationships. While the categorisation of every human relationship into 3 categories of Secure (50% of the population), Anxious (21%), and Avoidant (25%) may not be all inclusive and exhaustive for those with a discerning and scrutinising disposition; however, it does offer a useful insight into your relationships, if you can relate to one of the 3 categories.What I liked about the book is that it doesn't tell you which is the best category to belong to, or how you should change in order to be more Secure (the category ideally suited for all relationships - the O Negative of relationships). The lessons in the book are more about understanding the 3 categories and feeling comfortable with yours in order to avoid the negative emotions that come associated with relationships between people belonging to different categories; especially ones that arise from Anxious-Avoidant relationships, which tends to happen most frequently despite the inherent incompatibilities.Given their nature, this book is more likely to be read by people belonging to the Anxious category, and much less by the Avoidants, who could possibly benefit the most from it.",48,3
9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Hanne,222,317,5,"April 26, 2015","Don’t be fooled by the title. The title is like wishy washing voodoo magic to suddenly make a sparkly relationship appear. And that’s bullshit of course. The actual content of the book is not bullshit though. It opened my eyes, and so many puzzle pieces finally came together.The premise is that your childhood, but also any experience you had afterwards with intimate relationships, lead to certain attachment patterns. If you’re lucky, you’re securely attached. If you’re slightly less lucky you might be avoidant or anxious.So many things I read in the testimonies nearly brought me to tears because they were so real to me. It felt like the author had opened my own head and take a peek of what’s inside.I finished this book a few weeks ago, and it has helped me tremendously. First, to understand what it is I struggle with, and to know that I’m hardly alone. Second, to identify my behaviours and realizing when I’m doing something “off” (protest behaviours, overanalysing, thinking just a sentence can ruin things) so I don’t go sabotaging yet another good thing without wanting to.But what I also like about it is that it is acknowledging these attachment patters without saying that there’s something wrong with you. They come from the cards we got dealt in life, and these patterns also make us who we are. Yes, getting yourself to a more secure stage will help, but until you get there, accept who you are, and try to slowly get yourself on the right path.",43,N/A
9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Deb,349,77,5,"July 6, 2012","**Attached…to this book**I’ll admit it. I am totally attached to _Attached_. But, not in an unhealthy way, really. I’ve read my fair share of books on relationships (including textbooks during my clinical training as a therapist), and I can honestly say that this book provides the most elegant framework for organizing, explaining, and rescuing relationship problems that I’ve seen. It clearly delivers on the hope that the authors have for this book: “We hope that you will use the relationship wisdom distilled in this book, from more than two decades of research, to find happiness in your romantic connections and to soar in all aspects of your life. If you follow the attachment principles we have outlined, you will be actively giving yourself the best shot at finding—and keeping—a deeply gratifying love, instead of leaving one of the most important aspects of your life to chance!” (pp. 272-273)Based on the science of attachment, the book looks at the three basic types of attachment: avoidant, anxious, and secure. In a nutshell: if you’re avoidant, relationships feel like a threat to your independence; if you’re anxious, relationships feel like a lifeline that is going to be yanked away from you at any moment; if you’re secure, relationships provide you with peace of mind. Early on, the book helps you determine your style of attachment, and the style of your partner as well. After helping to determine attachment styles, the book takes a closer look at how these three different attachment styles present themselves in everyday life, and when they are most likely to clash. Not surprisingly, the most clash-likely relationship is between a person with an avoidant style of attachment and one with an anxious style. (Can we say distancer and pursuer?) The authors provide both insight and hope for helping avoiding the needless suffering often accompanying this attachment style mis-match: “People have very different capacities for intimacy. And when one person’s need for closeness is met with another person’s need for independence and distance, a lot of unhappiness ensues. By being cognizant of this fact, both of you can navigate your way better in the dating world to find someone with intimacy needs similar to your own (if you are unattached) or reach an entirely new understanding about your differing needs in an existing relationship—a first and necessary step toward steering it in a more secure direction.” (p. 270)The book provides tools and communication strategies that use attachment principles to help you avoid the traps of mismatched relationships (and/or help you free yourself and survive one you may have fallen into), and shows you how to focus your energies on building secure relationships. Even if you’re not the secure type (only about 50% of people are), it still is possible to be in a secure relationship—it just takes a good mix of self-awareness and ongoing work. Think of this book as the guidebook for doing that work. The cherry on top of this deliciously satisfying book comes in the form of the authors’ simple, but profound, summary of the key essentials for finding and keeping (secure) love:***Your attachment needs are legitimate. ***You shouldn’t feel bad for depending on the person you are closet to—it is part of your genetic makeup.***A relationship, from an attachment perspective, should make you feel more self-confident and give you peace of mind. If it doesn’t, this is a wake up call!***And, above all, remain true to your authentic self—playing games will only distance you from your ultimate goal of finding happiness, be it with your current partner or with someone else. (p. 272)_Attached_ should seriously be required reading for anyone who has been, is, wants to be, or will be in a relationship. Yep, it is that good. And, so can be your relationships if you take this book to heart!",36,4

9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Gretta,469,6,1,"August 5, 2022","This book is so simplistic that it reads like a personality quiz in a women's magazine. It complexity ignores issues of gender, simply stating that most people of both genders fall into the ""stable"" category rather than the ""avoidant"" or ""anxious"" groups. What would have been more interesting would have been an exploration of why women are perceived as falling more often into the ""anxious"" category. This book also seemed to ignore the importance of other personality traits that make one person attracted to another and attribute the entirety of a persons choice in mate to their attachment style.

9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Meghan Hughes Ohrstrom,106,1931,5,"May 28, 2020","This book was incredibly insightful & helped me figure out my own attachment style & ways I cope with issues in relationships. It also made me aware of the reasons why friends & family stay with the people that they do even if they know the relationship doesn’t serve them. This book is a study on the relationships we hold & how they make us react to issues when they arise. It dissects the secure, anxious, & avoidant attachment styles. It was incredible well-researched & provided significant resources, stories for reference, & workbooks to use to analyze your own attachment style. It made me realize that at the beginning of Finley & I’s relationship, I was anxiously attached to him because of the ways I’d been treated by romantic partners in the past. I now consider myself secure with anxious MOMENTS when I am overwhelmed by emotions (lol). I’ll include a story as example below..One day, Fin was going to his friend’s aunt’s house to meet her & have dinner with them. He invited me to the dinner part & I got an uber to head over there. It was in a different part of town I wasn’t familiar with, so I texted him I was on the way so he could meet me when I got there & sat back for the hour or so long drive. When I got to the large apartment complex, I texted him I had arrived, but realized he hadn’t replied to my text that I was on the way or that I was there. I began to panic because I had gone a very long way & there were hundreds of apartments they could be in. I sat in the apartment lobby & panic-called him nearly 10 times, each time it went to voicemail. I didn’t know the aunt’s name to ask the front desk attendant what unit she was in, so I just paced around the complex waiting. I began to cry because I didn’t know what to do. Wasn’t he expecting me? Why hadn’t he checked his phone? I began to spiral. I thought about heading home, but didn’t want to spend the money to immediately head back, so I just sat there panic-crying for another half hour. When I finally heard from him, he explained that he wasn’t connected to the internet in her apartment & had no service, so he hadn’t seen any of my messages or calls. He came to find me with his friend & the aunt’s husband & I was so embarrassed. I had red puffy eyes & had so clearly been crying that everyone just felt so bad for me & I felt uncomfortable that I had reacted so anxiously. Looking back, I could’ve called someone to pass the time until he called me back, read my book, or simply gone back home & called it a miscommunication. I realize now that I was actually just so anxious he’d forgotten about me that I reacted the way I did. Back then, I did a great deal of explaining to him that “being forgotten” was a big fear of mine. Now, I don’t even consider that a fear of mine at all because I know he never could forget me & in fact on that day, he never had. It was just a simple internet issue..Anyways! This was a great & informative read. It helped me a lot. Very insightful! 10/10!",20,N/A
9547888,Attached The New Science of Adult Attachment and How It Can Help You Find—and Keep—Love,Caitlyn Kilgore,42,3,1,"November 6, 2015","While sharing the occasional snippet of relationship wisdom, this book far from delivers what I hoped for. It is full of rhetorical questions and long introductions that waste the readers time (have you ever heard of citation? Or APA style? Footnotes?). Additionally, it makes people's relationships out to be nothing more than a reflection of one of three (or four) attachment styles - which, by the way, means that no one has a ""unique"" attachment style. Much of the book reads more like a Cosmopolitan quiz than a pop psychology book based on the latest studies in adult attachment. The ""unique"" attachment styles that are described are posed as the sole indicator of whether a relationship will succeed or fail. The authors presume that any action someone takes is indicative of their attachment style and not possibly of their current situation. There are too many blanket statements and subtle judgments about the ""insecures"" being less-than.An actual excerpt:""Before we learned about attachment theory, we took the secures of the world for granted, and even dismissed them as boring. But looking through the attachment prism, we've come to appreciate secure people's talents and abilities. The goofy Homer Simpson-like colleague whome we barely noticed was suddenly transformed into a guy with impressive relationship talent who treats his wife admirably, and our get-a-life neighbor suddenly became a perceptive, caring person who keeps the entire family emotionally in check. But not all secure people are homebodies or goofy. You are not settling by going secure! Secures come in all shapes and forms. Many are good-looking and sexy. Whether plain or gorgeous, we've learned to appreciate them all for what they really are - the ""super-mates"" of evolution - and we hope that you will too.""... anyone who think Homer Simpson is in any way an ideal relationship role model has never watched the Simpsons and is delivering inaccurate relationship advise... Also, ""super-mates""?!?!?!I find this book to be further proof that MDs are not cut out to be authors. ",19,1 comment
