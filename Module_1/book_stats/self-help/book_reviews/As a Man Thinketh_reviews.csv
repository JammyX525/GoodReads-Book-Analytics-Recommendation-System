Self-help or Self-development books are often long and descriptive books, typically attempting to orient the reader along a particular school of thought (which is not a bad thing). But this book is an exception to that rule. An incredible amount of principles are explained in this tiny book, and in such a clear way, with all the characteristics of any other self-help book. I'm certain that this should be a must have book for anyone whose interested in this genre. It won't take you more than an hour to read the entire book, but you will be surprised how much you'll come across.""In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result.

The main message of this succinct, yet powerful, book is: the quality of your thoughts determine your quality of life. If your thoughts are pure and good, your life will also be good; and vice versa.""Man's mind may be likened to a garden, which may be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild; but whether cultivated or neglected, it must, and will, bring forth. If no useful seeds are put into it, then an abundance of useless weed-seeds will fall therein, and will produce their kind.""The author maintains: The man is the master of thought, the moulder of character, and the maker and shaper of condition, environment, and destiny. He compares the human mind with a garden and the man with a gardener. Just like a gardener removes the weeds from his garden so must we discard the impure and useless thoughts from our mind and must concentrate on cultivating the useful and pure thoughts. By the right choice and true application of thoughts, man ascends towards perfection.On a different note: I found this book to be the source of books rooted in 'law of attraction' approaches. The books such as: Magic of Believing, The Secret, etc. - bear a striking resemblance with this book. Needless to say this book has been very influential since its publication. My actual rating: 3.5/5.0Recommended! ",164,11
81959,As a Man Thinketh,Jesse Field,736,36,1,"October 13, 2010","""Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force."" This is the basic idea behind all of James Allen's sugary half-truths. When I found an audio file with this text pre-packaged into my new learnoutloud.com cart, read by ""Brian Johnson, Philosopher and CEO of Zaadz.com,"" I was briefly intrigued. Then as I listened a bit more, I thought it was some kind of joke or parody -- surely in just a moment Brian, ""Philosopher,"" will put on a more genuine, critical voice. Surely he would tell us that of course you can't change your circumstances with your thoughts. That's not philosophy, but magical thinking. Surely he would remind us, as Barbara Erhenreich has tried to do, that perfectly virtuous people fail and suffer everyday. And that perfect scoundrals, animalistic beasts, succeed and prosper all the time. (For some reason I think of Adam Sandler. I believe he once commented with pride that he did not finish high school.) Surely people all know, in this day and age, that ""serenity"" is not a viable goal in life? That the best we can do is meet the challenges as they come, acknowledge that life is always a struggle, and find reasons to continue the struggle? Surely people don't fall for this dully polished hogwash, already dreadfully unoriginal by 1903? Doesn't the pompousness, the selfishness, the sheer vacuity of Allen's thinking show through?Sadly, there truly is no end to how gullible readers can be. I suppose when you combine basic ignorance with the anxiety and ambivalence we all feel these days (trust me I feel it too) then the result is that a large part of the population will continue to purchase the age-old idea that ""right thoughts"" will change the world. That's why Brian Johnson can live the glamorous, self-oriented life of a ""CEO."" That's why Allen's 1903 text is plastered all over the internet, from Wikipedia to Project Gutenberg and so on and so forth. I've hit on yet another node of the most compelling fantasy that exists in this market-and-work oriented world. ""There's a sucker born every minute."" - P.T. Barnum (died 1891)",63,20

  Mind is the Master power that moulds and makes,And Man is Mind, and evermore he takesThe tool of Thought, and, shaping what he wills,Brings forth a thousand joys, a thousand ills:‚ÄîHe thinks in secret, and it comes to pass:Environment is but his looking-glass.
This is a short and inspiring philosophical book with its title being influenced by a verse in the Bible. The author also makes references to Jesus, Krishna, and Buddha while explaining his ideas. The central theme of the book is that a man is shaped by the thoughts he harbors whether consciously or subconsciously. Good and positive thoughts will attract joy and peace while negative thoughts will attract misery and despair. If he finds himself in an unfortunate situation that is out of his control, he needs to accept the fact that nothing lasts forever. He can choose to find the good things from an unpleasant experience while from the bad things, he can learn important lessons. He can let the failure and pain guide and motivate him to improve himself and his life to earn the success he rightfully deserves. This will cause him to take ownership of his life and not blame other people for everything that is wrong in his life. All a person needs to do is alter the way he perceives a situation. If you see the world as your ally, you‚Äôll find that the world is a beautiful thing that wants you to succeed and it‚Äôll present endless people and opportunities to achieve those goals and if you believe that the world is conspiring against you, you‚Äôll find yourself at war with the enemy you can‚Äôt conquer and live with perpetual hell of your own making. Our thoughts will manifest into his habits and the habits will shape our circumstances because mind and body are intimately connected.If you want to live a successful life, you need to have a passion or a vision of an ideal life. If you have a picture of what an ideal life looks like to you, you‚Äôre going to work really hard to achieve that and the unfavorable circumstance you‚Äôre in right now will seem like a temporary state that you‚Äôll eventually get out of. Using the basic rule of cause and effect, instead of worrying about things you can‚Äôt control, you can focus on giving the best from your side. If that doesn‚Äôt work, you‚Äôll need to learn to find better and efficient ways and try again. A calm person draws strength from within so the external circumstances don‚Äôt faze him. What you get is what you deserve in life and if you don‚Äôt have it then you need to work for it and earn it. It‚Äôs mostly how to use the law of attraction to your maximum benefit. The author also talks about the benefits of meditation in your daily life and interesting discussion about the cause of suffering and how to reach a state of enlightenment.All in all, a nice short read.",51,17

81959,As a Man Thinketh,Annalisa,521,1336,4,"July 14, 2008","A small collection of thoughts on how powerful our minds truly are, this is book you'll want to turn to again and again because though it's short, it's deep with meaning. There is no fluff to distract our brains from epiphany to epiphany. Some of my favorite quotes:Thought and character are one. The dreamers are the saviors of the world. In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result. Chance is not. A man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.Act is the blossom of thought, and joy and suffering are its fruits. Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself. Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are. Indigence and indulgence are the two extremes of wretchedness.He who has conquered doubt and fear has conquered failure. Thought allied fearlessly to purpose becomes creative force. They who have no central purpose in their life fall an easy prey to petty worries, fears, troubles, and self-pityings. Victories attained by right thought can only be maintained by watchfulness. Men imagine that thought can be kept secret, but it cannot; it rapidly crystallizes into habit, and habit solidifies into circumstance. There is no physician like cheerful thought for dissipating the ills of the body; there is no comforter to compare with good will for dispersing the shadows of grief and sorrow. A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape is circumstances. Why the four stars? There are a few statements that did not quite win me over. Such as: Wrinkles are not manifestations of age but poor character, and health issues are manifestations of a poor mind. I'm not denying that thought affects health, but it is not the only cursor for poor health.Suffering is always the effect of wrong thought in some direction. Only most of the time. Sometimes we suffer most in our vulnerability to those we love when they do wrong or hurt us or suffer themselves. This godly sorrow may not be what he means by suffering, but I also can't imagine suffering at the unforseen death of a loved one to be suffering of our own making, unless you are considering it to be a challenge in life you chose to encounter. Calmness is a virtue every human should aspire. While steady demeanor is a worthy goal, there is much to be said for enthusiasm, emotion, and variety in personalities. While tempers and impatience are not good qualities, neither is a lack of emotion, and there is nothing wrong with a happy animated person, a person I would never describe as calm. Calm is a great quality, but it's not the all-inclusive. If he had said peace, I would understand. ",33,4

    ""As a man thinketh in his heart so is he""
  
^ That one sentence sums up the whole idea of this book, or rather, an essay.In As a Man Thinketh, James Allen strongly professes the concept that a man is only as good as his thoughts. While in a sense, it may be true, you could also argue against it. It has a lot of possibilities for an amusing, thought-provoking debate. Look at this ‚Äì 	‚óè
  
    ‚ÄúA man does not come to the almshouse or the jail by the tyranny of fate or circumstance, but by the pathway of groveling thoughts and base desires. Nor does a pure-minded man fall suddenly into crime by stress of any mere external force; the criminal thought had long been secretly fostered in the heart, and the hour of opportunity revealed its gathered power.‚Äù
  
Unsurprisingly, I was reminded of Jean Val Jean while reading this sentence. Not surprised if you did too. We all have loved that character, who, out of sheer desperation to feed his family, stole a piece of bread and ended up in prison. Theft is a crime, no matter what they say, but feeding your family is not. Bringing up this fictional scenario to point out that Allen is wrong, is not my intention though. I‚Äôd rather you think of all the poor people there, who were tried and tested in court, many sentenced to death, because they did something similar, or worse. Does that justification make them any less guilty? No. But does that knowledge lessen your hatred for the said accused? Admit it, it did. 	‚óè
  
    ""Circumstance does not make the man; it reveals him to himself‚Äù
  
So what does that say about the person‚Äôs thoughts? Had he always harbored ill thoughts, thought of stealing, killing, murdering? He might have. Could he have avoided those thoughts if he willed himself hard enough? The answer is NO. Point blank. However hard we try, a controlled mind always slips, always blends in with its surroundings, because just like a coin with two sides, a mind is composed of bad thoughts as much as the good ones. We may think bad stuff, and will ourselves not to do it. But when we actually do something bad, it is NOT BECAUSE WE HAD THOUGHT OF IT ONCE BEFORE. Of course, it is just what I feel to be true, you may have arguments that I may counter-argue. Still, I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE COMPLETE CONTROL OF ONES‚Äô MIND BY ONES‚Äô SELF, IS NOT POSSIBLE.	‚óè
  
     ""A man cannot directly choose his circumstances, but he can choose his thoughts, and so indirectly, yet surely, shape his circumstances‚Äù
  
That, my friends, I whole-heartedly disagree with. You can choose to be good or bad, but you definitely cannot choose to think good thoughts or bad thoughts. Duh. Try it for yourself if you don‚Äôt believe me.	‚óè
   ‚ÄúChange of diet will not help a man who will not change his thoughts. When a man makes his thoughts pure, he no longer desires impure food.‚Äù
I mean, seriously? What someone eats is his own business, you idiot. Even if you eat a snake, or a man for that matter, your body will adjust unless there are other ways for survival. Alright?	‚óè
  
    ""The will to do springs from the knowledge that we can do. Doubt and fear are the great enemies of knowledge, and he who encourages them, who does not slay them, thwarts himself at every step.""
  
However impressive the above sentence might be, I can‚Äôt think of confining the whole of human behavioral pattern and thoughts to such a simple conclusion. One does not simply NOT DO things because he thinks he can‚Äôt. An ordinary human being, being a social creature, considers a lot many more factors rather than the simple ignorant fact that he can‚Äôt do what he wants to. I couldn‚Äôt vouch enough for how wrong that statement is. Yeah, I have come across such phrases before - ‚ÄúNothing is impossible‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do it if you think you can‚Äôt‚Äù. And no, I haven‚Äôt questioned them before, because they were meant in a motivational context. But reading Allen‚Äôs work, where he analyses human mind, and spreads out reasons why we‚Äôre all doing it all wrong ‚Äòmentally‚Äô, I had to say it. And I don‚Äôt mean to be demotivating. If you are inspired by this work, that‚Äôs a good thing, go on with your life. But if you are anything like me, you might be criticizing the book too, and I‚Äôm merely contributing my opinions.	‚óè
  
     ‚ÄúALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts‚Äù
  
Please don‚Äôt get me started on this one again. A man simply doesn‚Äôt fail because he thought them all wrong. And a man wouldn‚Äôt conquer the world with his stupid domineering thoughts. 	‚óè
  
    ‚ÄúTo desire is to obtain; to aspire is to, achieve.‚Äù
  
You get that? It‚Äôs the same thing over and over again. I‚Äôm amazed he managed to stretch it out for a full 65 pages. That‚Äôs impressive vocabulary skills. Blah.This one might be the truest thing he said, but it is not a fact at all. It doesn‚Äôt work in all situations. Like those physics theories we were forced to learn in high school? Applies to some places but doesn‚Äôt run true for the rest. 	
  The strength of the effort is the measure of the result.
All in all, I get that while James Allen tried some old-school motivational lines, (okay, maybe he is the master of those ‚Äòold-school‚Äô motivational lines. This was published in what? 1902?), it didn‚Äôt work with me. That might be because I‚Äôm unmoved by non-fiction and motivational pieces in general, so you may still want to read this book. And yet, I say, ‚ÄúA man is literally what he thinks, his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.‚Äù - NOT.",24,5

81959,As a Man Thinketh,Gergana,227,391,5,"February 7, 2016","I can hardly believe that this book was published in 1902! If you know about the ""Law of Attraction"" it's very likely you found out about it from a movie called The Secret that came out in 2006 - a 100 years later! A part of the human population was blown away by it (me included), other parts were either amused, disturbed, hated it or found it hard to care.Now, this review contemplation rant WHATEVER will be weird, especially if you don't believe in the Law of Attraction. It's very likely you'll end up thinking I need some serious help. XD  Which is fine, you don't know where I live anyways.Before I say anything else, I have to admit that although I practice the Law (I freak out every time it works) and I agree with the majority of the teachings (e.g. if you have problems in life they are your own doing, stop complaining, see the bright side/opportunity, etc.) I am rather concerned with the general obsession for owning stuff and believing that having something that you currently lack will bring you happiness.  So in this new ""happiness movement"" people often get encouraged to desire stuff. (Or at least imagine we already have them). Why? Cause you HAVE TO! We all know that owning the newest piece of technology will make us happier. Just look at all those happy faces in the smartphone TV ads. Or how happy physically fit and attractive people look on the Posters. They definitely get to pick the best husbands/wives. Look at the rich people on the news! I bet they've never had health/family/mental problems - owning a Rolls Royce guarantees perfect life!We are almost being conditioned to desire, to think happy thoughts all the time, to wish for better jobs, more money, a truer love, bigger home, etc. And we often end up neglecting what we currently posses. In fact, the more we believe that thoughts can attract something better, the more we might end up hating the situation we are currently in. The main problem is.... why do we desire it in the first place? Who taught us to want it? Will it really make us happier? And when do we put a stop to it? What do we do if we become addicted to ""desiring""? What if we are never satisfied?For example - you can desire for the perfect mate (boyfriend/girlfriend), but if the mate does something ""wrong"" or disagrees with you, would you wish for a new/better one right away? If it's easy and quick? Why waste your time and energy dealing with a problem, learning tolerance or practicing forgiveness, when all you have to do is just move on the next option?I guess, what I'm trying to say is- don't take this book (and The Secret) way too seriously. Life is not meant to be spent solely on chasing after dreams or wishing for a better future. Sometimes, problems happen for a reason and sometimes misfortune is what makes us better, more human. In my experience, the Law worked in two cases:1. When my mind is cleared (after experiencing some dramatic phase of my life) and I am super focused on what I want for a couple of days, then I stop thinking about it completely. It usually takes 4-5 days for things/people to ""manifest"" (and that still scares the shit out of me).2. When I end up being happy with what I have, practice mindfulness and just feel super relaxed. This takes longer, because I don't really desire anything at this stage, but if I remember to wish for something I just do it for a few minutes and then go back to being ""present"".UnFortunately, I'm too busy with life to really spend too much time contemplating the ""wrongness"" of my current situation.Don't wish for something when you are feeling depressed for not having it. Not having lots of money/perfect partner/great carrier according to the society's standards is not ""wrong"", unless you believe it.If you are stuck and you find it hard to ""manifest"", try reading the teachings of Buddha, Tao or Toltec Philosophy to balance the ""ego"".The Secret is better written, better explained, more practical and more relevant, but I would still recommend As a Man Thinketh for everyone who is curious. It's a revolutionary (but not very well-known) piece of work that has also inspired Napoleon Hill to write Think and Grow Rich. Anyways, if you want to start from somewhere, start with The Secret and try to keep reading/watching the DVD. The first half hour is damn right freaky and feels like you are watching some weird religious propaganda if you're new to it. ",20,10

It obeys the operations of the mind, whether they be deliberately chosen or automatically expressed. At the bidding of unlawful thoughts the body sinks rapidly into disease and decay; at the command of glad and beautiful thoughts it becomes clothed with youthfulness and beauty.‚Äù*Thought and purpose‚ÄúA man should conceive of a legitimate purpose in his heart, and set out to accomplish it. He should make this purpose the centralizing point of his thoughts. It may take the form of a spiritual ideal, or it may be a worldly object, according to his nature at the time being; but whichever it is, he should steadily focus his thought-forces upon the object, which he has set before him.‚Äù*The thought-factor in achievement‚ÄúALL that a man achieves and all that he fails to achieve is the direct result of his own thoughts...Before a man can achieve anything, even in worldly things, he must lift his thoughts above slavish animal indulgence.‚Äù*Visions and ideals‚ÄúThe Vision that you glorify in your mind, the Ideal that you enthrone in your heart‚Äîthis you will build your life by, this you will become.‚Äù*Serenity‚ÄúCALMNESS of mind is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom. It is the result of long and patient effort in self-control. Its presence is an indication of ripened experience, and of a more than ordinary knowledge of the laws and operations of thought.‚ÄùBeing brief and clear in presentation,this book is an excellent work in the self-help genre and unlike many others in that genre,interesting till the end.
