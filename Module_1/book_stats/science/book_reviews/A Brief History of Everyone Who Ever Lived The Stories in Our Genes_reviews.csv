30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Paul Bryant,"2,161",9022,3,"October 29, 2016","It’s hard to find a modern book on race which will tell you what is the current scientific thinking, given the remarkable progress of genetics and the unravelling of the human genome and all that. There are a thousand books on racism, but hardly any on race. Isn’t that curious? I believe that may be because scientists realise it’s a hornet’s nest and they prefer not to stick their heads in.I recently heard of Nicholas Wade’s A Troubling Inheritance (2014) but before I got to that one I found this one, which turns out to be pretty much what I was looking for – a third of it anyway, the other two thirds is above my head. But first, what can genetics do for you?SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THE GENE FOR RIDICULOUS SCIENTIFIC CLAIMSAdam Rutherford does a search on Google : “Scientists discover the gene for”. It gets him thousands of headlines from every type of publication “from the trashy to the august”.Scientists discover the gene for cocaine addiction (Guardian 11 November 2008)Scientists discover height gene (BBC Outline, 3 September 2007)Scientists have discovered an “anxiety gene” (Daily Mail, 19 July 2002)Scientists find “gay gene” that can help predict your sexuality (Daily Mirror, 9 October 2015)Scientists find gene for compulsive reviewing of books on Goodreads (Okay, I made that one up)Adam Rutherford holds his head in his hands and moans slightly. Then he writes this book, the message of which isIt’s much more complicated than that.Mainly this book is a deflating mythbusting exercise – you can’t check anyone’s DNA and find out what percentage of her is from the Sudan and what percentage is Viking. It’s a bit disappointing really – I wanted to ask Dr Rutherford, well, what can you tell me? Never mind about what you can’t. He likes to say what you can’t do. RACEOne of the things he thinks genetics can do and has done is show that scientifically speaking, there’s no such thing as race. This was the best part of the book. I like it when people draw a line in the sand. Actually, in this case, he’s obliterating the many previous lines which have been drawn in the sand. there are no essential genetic elements for any particular group of people who might be identified as a “race”. As far as genetics is concerned, race does not exist…. This does not align with the popular concept of race.He hastily adds That, of course, does not mean that racism doesn’t exist.Okay, he’s willing to say that there may be other interpretations:The question of what race means from a scientific point of view is complex, controversial and still a source of great ire and debate.But that doesn’t last long :Biology fundamentally deceives our eyes. Genetically, two black people are more likely to be more different to each other than a black person and a white person…. The genes that confer skin pigmentation are few, but mask a level of deeper genetic variation within Africa than without. JEWISH SONGWRITERS, BLACK ATHLETESSo then we get to the ticklish question – what about when it appears to be clear that a particular “race” appears to be BETTER at some activity than other “races”? Is it racist to say that, for instance, Jewish Americans have been consistently brilliant at writing popular music for about a hundred years? (This is something which particularly fascinates me.) All the way from Gershwin and Rodgers and Hart to Goffin and King and Greenwich and Barry and on to Randy Newman, Bob Dylan, Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen – the list is endless. Is it in their genes? Dr Rutherford picks another obvious example, black athletes. It turns out : there is no genetic component. He says robustly:The idea that black people are better at sport because of genetics, and possibly because of breeding during the wicked centuries of slavery, is built upon tissue foundations, and its cultural ubiquity yet another example of the chasm between what we think and what science says is true.Well, it’s a curious thing. Adam Rutherford along with other geneticists say very clearly that race does not exist, but of course as we know every day the world ignores this and proceeds on the assumption that everyone is a member of a discrete race, or is to be classified as mixed race. So it all becomes rather like atheists arguing that there’s no God when almost everyone in the world operates on the assumption that there is.I think we must conclude that the human race, speaking generally, does not much care what scientists say is real or not real. There’s just no telling them. They just stick their fingers in their ears and say to people like Adam Rutherford “la la la la, we’re not listening”. ",146,35
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Trevor,"1,279",21300,5,"February 14, 2021","This is a nice wee book. It is also a reasonably quick read and is even readable: two nice things for a book on such a complex topic to be if it possibly can manage it. I’ve reviewed his other book on how to argue with a racist – so will keep to things here that aren’t covered there – although, there really is lots of overlap. One of the things that we mere mortals – that is, people who do not have a degree in genetics – can tend to assume is that our genes are basically like a series of switches that get turned on or off when we are born (or even before that) and, well, that’s that. You know, at birth my gene for composing symphonies was flicked to the off position, and so that explains the remarkable shortage of symphonies I’ve subsequently composed. Same goes for eye colour – in my case, flicked to brown. Same goes, I presume, for lacrosse playing ability – well, I assume. Since I’ve never tried to play lacrosse, perhaps this is a kind of recessive gene that’s been ‘on’ the whole time waiting patiently for me to get around to stumbling across that net thing and ball. Just as an aside, when I was a child, I’m nearly certain I was told that lacrosse was an Indian game – but the person saying this must have meant an American Indian (aka, Native American) game – in double checking how to spell lacrosse I’ve learnt something new.Anyway – genes don’t quite work like that – as switches, that is. A few years ago, I went to Western Australia with a friend and we went into a contemporary art gallery in Perth. There was a remarkable artwork there called ‘Probably Chelsea’ by Heather Dewey Hagborg. The point of the artwork was to use Chelsea Manning’s DNA to create a series of possible people all as estimates derived from her DNA. You see, if DNA worked the way we mostly think it does, then if we were to find some DNA left at a crime scene we should be able to tell lots and lots of things about the person that DNA belonged to. We should be able to create a kind of photo-fit of features from that sample. You know, we might not be able to tell how intelligent they are (despite how much people go on about the genetic basis of intelligence) but stuff like hair colour, eye colour, skin colour, height, sexual preference, likelihood of them being diabetic, stuff like that should all be relatively easy to mark off the list. So, how come it isn’t? When you watch the news and they find DNA of the bad-guy, how come they don’t say, “He is six-foot-two, with eyes of blue, and a mole on is left elbow.” The reason is that virtually all phenotypical expressions of genes are ‘statistical’ rather than ‘hard and fast’. You might have ‘the gene’ for blue eyes, but still have brown eyes. The artwork is a series of 30 hanging face masks, all of which are artists impressions, all of which are possible Chelsea Mannings as decided from her DNA. We like our science to be nice and reductionist, for it to provide simple answers – a series of yeses and noes – but science (even genetics) doesn’t work anything quite like that. That’s the key thing you are likely to learn from this book. That genes aren’t really anything like switches, that the dichotomy between nature and nurture is a false one, given the two sides of that dichotomy are in a dance more than standing in a stark opposition, and that very few genes in our ‘genetic map’ work alone, or in isolation, or as a switch.The world, it turns out, is richer and more interesting than we would generally like it to be. It’s all terribly annoying, but it does seem to be the way it works.",39,N/A
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Emma,970,956,5,"September 15, 2016","The stories of our genes have been all over publishing right now and this is one of the best examples of how scientists can make complex subjects interesting, relevant, and fun. Adam Rutherford reads his own work, something I particularly love as it enables the author to convey the passion and enthusiasm they hold for their subject in a way that no narrator can match. And he's funny with it too. It's one of those listening experiences where you end up feeling like you've learnt something but had a good laugh doing it. He debunks myths with dedication and humour (the section on the extinction of gingers is particularly amusing), explains the current status of research and knowledge, and offers the some idea about how much more there is to learn. It's truly fascinating.For me, as a history enthusiast, I really enjoyed the way science and history are coming together to offer insights that neither subject can do alone. For example, in genetically mapping the people of Britain, it was found that there was very little of the Roman invaders left in our genes, suggesting that while they may her left us many things within the material, cultural, and social spheres, they clearly weren't interacting with us more physically. That says a lot about the whole systems in place during a very long period. Happy to rule us, but not have sex with us clearly. Not only that, I had no idea how many different types of humans there have been, what types of remains had been found, and the ways in which scientists are using these remains to map the movements of ancient peoples. That we can see the full genome of people who lived many thousands of years ago is staggering, the we continue to pass on some of that information within our genes is incredible. This book has turned me from someone largely uninterested in the specifics of prehistory to a bit of a fan. Like a lot of history, it's a thrilling form of detective work and the science of our genes has so much to say.I very much recommend it, even if you are new to the subject, as I was. The experience reminds me of having that one favourite teacher at school- you know the one who converted you on to a specific subject and nurtured your interest. For me, it was history, not science. But Rutherford has shown me how it can be a mix of both. ",35,4
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Radiantflux,411,403,2,"September 8, 2019","76th book for 2018.I hate it when books don't deliver on their titles. I was expecting a brief history of everyone who lived. Spoiler: Didn't happen. Various chapters are devoted to the authors own pet peeves like how genetics is misrepresented in the media. A much better book, which at least lives up to it's title, is Robert David Reich's ""Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the new science of the human past"". Topics about genetics and behavior and the effects of environment on gene expression are covered in a far more nuanced fashion in ""Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst"" by Robert Sapolsky.While it was only a small part of the book: I found his discussion of color vision (as an ex-vision scientist) annoying. He completely misrepresents how color vision works: We don't have ""three-color vision"" (whatever that means - we do see FOUR pure colors); this is not because we have 3-cones classes (three colors) - for instance, if we had 4-cone classes we wouldn't see four colors). His discussion of tetrachromacy (which occurs in about 50% of women) is an interesting story, which he fails to explain in any real way, which is a shame as the genetics is interesting. His complete failure to explain color vision makes me wonder what other errors are in the book.2-stars.",31,5
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,David Rubenstein,801,2504,4,"July 12, 2020","This is an entertaining book about what genetics tells us about ourselves, and what it does not tell. For example, genetics tells us that a certain small percentage of our genes comes from Neanderthals. It cannot tell us if you descended from a particular tribe of Native Americans. DNA analyses tell us about tendencies, but does not tell you that you are violent, or prone to Alzheimer's disease, or what ""race"" you belong to. In fact, genetics cannot distinguish among races--it is a social classification, not a biological one.I got a kick out of reading about how so-and-so claims to be a direct descendant of Charlemagne. The claim is true; but just about every European is also a descendant. The book is packed with interesting anecdotes. The most riveting story is about England's King Richard III. The exhuming of his grave and subsequent DNA analysis fully corroborated the legend of his life and death, and the his portrayal by Shakespeare. Since he died 600 years ago, he is probably the oldest corpse positively identified through DNA analysis.I enjoy reading science books that are written by scientists who truly understand their field--as long as the book is well written. And this book is--the author is a geneticist, and the book is filled with the author's dry wit. It reminds me a lot of the books by Bill Bryson. I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by the author. The author's narration is clear, and his British accent is charming. ",28,1 comment
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Marc,"3,022",1007,3,"September 6, 2020","Genetic research has boomed in the last 30 years. A provisional highlight was the description of the human genome (an overview of the genetic code of our species) in 2003. But naturally science has not stood still since then. Nowadays, not a day goes by without spectacular discoveries or breakthroughs reported by geneticists in their research, for instance on diseases. This book by Adam Rutherford, a publicist with a background in evolutionary genetics, gives a comprehensive state of affairs at the time of the publication of this book, in 2016, now already 4 years ago. Not an easy task, because genetics turns out to be a lot more complicated than you might think. Rutherford therefore proceeds in small steps, and regularly follows side paths in which he occasionally explores certain technical aspects. That makes this book a bit elobarate at times, but in the end you get a very informative picture.A selection of some interesting tidbits. That mankind has barely 20,000 genes, much less than expected, and less than, for example, a banana or a grain of rice. That the Human Genome Project only gave a limited reading of human genetics and that there still are whole areas in the human genome of which we do not know exactly what function they have. That there are virtually no diseases that can be attributed to a single gene, on the contrary, that it seems that different pieces of genetic material are involved in all possible phenomena (negative and positive). That it certainly makes no sense to claim that phenomena such as criminal behaviour, intelligence, sexual orientation, etc. can be attributed to a particular gene. And also important, that the companies that offer a reading of your genetic ""family tree"" are in most cases charlatans, digging up generalities.But Rutherford offers much more than those tidbits. He also addresses thorny issues such as whether the concept of race has a genetic basis, he explores the nature/nurture debate, and sketches how human evolution still is going on. And of course, he disproves the bullshit spread by creationists. But what is particularly striking is his highly reasoned and nuanced defence of the scientific approach, in small steps, with word and reply in full transparency, and with attention to the limitations of the scientific method.Some minor drawbacks: occasionally Rutherford is very wordy and he likes to incorporate anecdotes in his account, improving the readability, but sometimes distracting from the essence. This book also is quite Britain-oriented, citing mostly British studies, and focussing on studies of British subjects. But all in all, I really enjoyed reading this.For the genetic research on the earliest human species, see my review of this book in my History account on Goodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...",27,4
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Katy ,753,55,3,"January 5, 2018","It is really difficult for me to articulate my feelings after I had read this book. I found this book fascinating in the first half which focused on what genes can tell us about the origin of our species, especially the bits discussing the evidence found in the genome of ancient remains. The tone was very humorous and quite sarcastic and it was just a lot of fun. Unfortunately, the second half focusing on race and where the actual science is heading in relation to the study of the human genome, was a bit yawn inducing.Adam Rutherford’s writing style felt quite jumbled at times and read like a stream of consciousness almost which felt odd. In my opinion, this book could have been just a tad more accessible and not bogged down with so much scantily explained jargon, the glossary also felt like an afterthought. I didn’t really feel there was a point to the book by the end. So in summary, this book starts off interesting and strong but gradually peters out by the end where I was on the verge of losing interest entirely. Still an interesting read though and I think it’s worth it.",23,1 comment
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Sense of History,356,387,3,"September 24, 2022","The title of this book is a bit misleading: in the first part Rutherford does indeed give a good overview of the evolutionary history of the human species (""a history of everyone who ever lived""), but thereafter he mainly gives a state of the art of genetic research in general, with everything what is involved. The first part was the main reason why I read this book, so in this review I will only go into that part.Classic archeology has ruled the domain of earliest human history for over 150 years, since the discovery of Neanderthal bones in a cave near Düsseldorf, Germany. In the 1950s the field of action shifted to Eastern and Southern Africa, gradually drawing up a family tree of human and pre-human species, like for instance Australopithecus or Homo Erectus. This family tree had to be revised approximately every 10 years or so, following the discovery of new, older fossils or the application of new dating methods. This was sometimes accompanied by unscientific methodologies and fierce infight between archaeologists, but that is not the subject of this book.From the 1990s onwards, genetics has put this pedigree model under intense pressure. An ever-better understanding of the DNA and especially the human genome (the entirety of the genetic code of man) made it possible to date human remains much more accurately and, above all, to establish almost unambiguous connections or distinctions between and within human species. For a while it seemed that now was offered a methodology that for once and for all could put an end to the endless disputes amongst archeologists and paleontologists. But then it turned out that the picture was much more complicated than expected. For instance, take the study of Neandertal people, which we know disappeared about 30,000 years ago. Study of the genetic material of our Sapiens species has unequivocally shown that it also contains typical Neandertal material, on average for about 2.5%. In other words, Neandertal and Sapiens interbred (in fact in several interconnecting 'waves'), so that you can say that though Neandertal is a dead-end branch of the human species, nevertheless he lives on in us (especially Europeans and East-Asians)! The same phenomenon is established with those curious other representatives of the ""homo genus"": the Denisova and the Floriensis. Rutherford rightly concludes: ""the ancient genomes awaiting discovery will show that the world was much more cosmopolitan in the millennia before we became the last representative of the homo genus"". And: ""It's now clearer than ever. that the old, simplistic view of how we became what we are is simply not correct. Gone are the days of neatly branched trees, of the bent monkey walking upright step by step”.Nice, but what did surprise me is that this spectacular evolution in genetic research is also subject to its own limitations. For example, almost all genetic research is focussed on the analysis of 'mitrochondrial DNA', that's a part of the genetic code that is situated outside of the cell nucleus, and it is easier to 'read' than the very long DNA-strings within the nucleus. Now this 'mitrochondrial DNA' is only transmitted to a next generation by the mother (the father has his own unique 'parcel', the well-known Y-chromosome). Limiting research to this part has the advantage of enabling a much faster analysis and establishing clear lines of connections and distinctions. But nevertheless, can we really be sure that this is a reliable method that gives us the whole picture? Of course, I'm a layman in these affairs, but once again it seems science is taking the path of segmentation, risking reductionism.Another limitation: apparantly it is not possible to extract DNA from species older than 100-50,000 years: the DNA in the fossil remains has almost always completely disintegrated, due to heat and moisture. The oldest complete genome of a sapiens is only 45,000 years old (at least it was the year this book was published, in 2016). In other words: for the time being, genetic research does not tell us everything about the earliest history of mankind, and especially about its predecessors, the australopithicus or the homo erectus of which we have found lots of fossils, not useful to genetic research. Only indirectly some data can be retrieved, by specifically looking at the quantity and diversity of mutations detectable within the 'modern' DNA, and establishing how many generations ago a certain mutation took root in a certain population or species. So, up until now, most of the gains of genetic research are within the history of Homo Sapiens itself. For instance, genetics has been able to map the migration waves of the Sapiens in a much better and more reliable way than classic archeology. But once again the answers are not completely unambiguous: genetic research confirms that agriculture certainly came to Europe via migration flows (a first wave from about 9,700-7,000 BP, and a second much larger one after 5,000 BP), but that too was accompanied by a considerable mixing with the local hunter-gatherer population, making it difficult to answer the classic question whether hunter-gatherers were expelled and annihilated by farmers, or adopted farming methods and were integrated in the farming population. Rutherford makes it clear that genetic research does provide us with a lot of new insights, but at the same time confronts us with a lot of new questions. Almost every door that is opened leads to new branching paths. In other words, genetic research does not provide all the answers, although Rutherford is convinced that science will continue to make progress and unravel more and more mysteries. Only time can tell. This is a nice introduction to an exciting new domain of studies, but beware: things are evolving so fast in this field, that a book such as this quickly can become outdated.",21,N/A
30135182,A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived The Stories in Our Genes,Kathleen,"1,275",119,4,"November 7, 2018","National Book Critics Circle Award Longlist for Nonfiction 2017. It has been roughly 15 years since the Human Genome Project determined that humans have about 20,000 genes. Surprisingly, this is less than either the roundworm or even a grain of rice. Everyone associated with the Project predicted thousands more—but they were wrong. Rutherford reports on the limits of what genes can tell us about ourselves. While they have helped us to understand the causes of some diseases; they have not helped us to eradicate or cure them.The science writer/geneticist points out that the modern human genome began in Africa around 300,000 years ago and developed web-like as ancient hominins coalesced into a single species. Further, genetic research has shown that race is not identifiable in the genome. Indeed, gene research has shown that a Namibian and a Nigerian have more genetic similarities with a Swede than they do each other. “Genetics has shown that people are different and these differences cluster according to geography and culture but never in a way that aligns with the traditional concepts of human races.”Rutherford takes issue with the brash marketing claims of some DNA companies that suggest they can identify ancestry lineage down to a specific Native American tribe. Such precision is just not possible. And health claims are just as shaky. For example, the gene marker associated with Alzheimer’s does not ensure they will get the disease. Nor does the absence of the gene marker protect them.Recommend this gene overview by the popular science writer.",20,N/A

The first “How We Came to Be”, looks at the genetic evidence around human evolution. It touches on Neanderthals, Denisovans and Flores Man (DNA can’t be recovered from earlier species) before looking at the evolution of modern H. sapiens. It also covers the timescale under which an individual’s family history will intersect with those of everyone else, and it’s probably put me off ever trying to use one of those commercial companies who promise to reveal your ancestry via your DNA (something that I had thought about, I must admit).I thought Part I was excellent. Part II, “Who We Are Now” is a slight drier read but still has plenty to recommend it. There are too many themes to summarise, but I think the author most wants to convey the message that there is never a single gene that explains any aspect of personality or behaviour. Genes do not act in isolation of one another, and all act in concert with environmental influences. “It’s a lot more complicated than you think” would be a one-line summary.There’s quite a lot of humour in the book, no doubt included in a conscious attempt to retain the interest of the general reader. For me it mostly fell flat. One or two references made me smile but on the whole I found the humour a bit forced.As the author acknowledges, this is a field where new discoveries are being made all the time.

It is fairly meaningless since there are more differences in the genes within ""racial"" groups than between. The most genetic variation in human being is found in Africa. The rest of us are descended from the narrow pool of genes carried by the people who left that continent. This is a very good introduction to the field of genetics, which will help you automatically realize that many of the headlines referring to new-found genes are more founded on the wish to sell papers and get clicks, than on real science.

Adam Rutherford has no doubt done his best, but his best just isn’t good enough. The book is so long-winded, muddled and rambling that the science gets lost along the way. A few anecdotes do not a good science book make. And it seems (though I am not qualified to judge) that he makes quite a few mistakes and misinterprets the data on more than one occasion.
