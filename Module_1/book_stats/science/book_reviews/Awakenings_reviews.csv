14456,Awakenings,William2,728,2816,5,"July 9, 2016","The crux of the book is the work Sacks began in the mid-1960s with dozens of post-encephalitic patients at Bronx's Beth Abraham hospital, then called the Bronx Home for Incurables and disguised here as Mount Carmel. These patients were infected in 1918 by the encephalitis lethargica virus, or sleepy sickness. (Not to be confused with the worldwide influenza pandemic of that same year.) Those who survived were able afterwards to lead normal lives for years and sometimes decades until they were stricken with Parkinson's disease-like symptoms: locked and rigid postures that turned them into living statuary (akinesia), hurrying gait (festination), frozen skewed gaze (oculogyyric crises), and so on. These patients did not have Parkinson's disease proper, but because the encephalitis reduced the neurotransmitter dopamine in the part of their brain known as the substantia nigra they experienced identical, if somewhat more severe symptoms than actual Parkinson's patients. They were to become know as post-encephalitics.In 1969 L-DOPA's cost came down sufficiently that Dr. Sacks began to prescribe it for his post-encephalitic patients. The results were at once miraculous and disastrous. In a matter of weeks, sometimes overnight, Sacks's patients were ""awakened"" from what for many had been decades of immobility, incommunicability, and dependence on high levels of nursing care. Suddenly these frozen figures were walking and talking, their personalities, in hiatus for so long, perfectly preserved. Dr. Sacks reviews the cases here of 20 such patients, from their often sudden awakening to the onset and growing severity of side effects. Awakenings is in the final analysis a tragedy. Few of Sacks patients could tolerate the long term effects of L-DOPA. Not a few regretted ever being treated with it. For a handful it provided a vastly improved quality of life. They became social again, needed far less nursing care, but the effects of the drug were highly unstable. In an appendix added to the 1990 edition, Sacks and a colleague analyze patient responses to L-DOPA using the then emerging discipline of chaos theory. This appears only in the 1990 edition since the discipline did not exist when Sacks and his patients began their trials of the levodopa in '69. Dr. Sacks never met a footnote he didn't love. The book is chockful of them. Those too long to fit alongside the text are included as appendices. Ninety-five percent of them seem to me indispensable. Sacks is a great thinker of immense erudition who possesses a highly readable prose style. The primary text provides straightforward exposition, but when read in conjunction with the footnotes--where much of the real meat of the book resides--it can at times take on an almost fiction-like discursiveness.Of Sacks's dozen or so books, I've read all but three. Awakenings is his magnum opus, his manifesto and policy declaration. In it he lays out his positions on the then current neurology of the day (Awakenings was first published in 1973) which he lambastes as coldly empirical and lacking a complementary metaphysical component. In America, and no doubt much of the West, these were the last years of the Physician as God. There was little public knowledge of medicine then, unlike today, and the doctor's role in a crisis was usually unquestioned. Today second opinions are sought with regularity, ""integrative"" approaches to healing more readily embraced, and there is a vast industry based on purveying medical knowledge to the general public. You can see this great change perhaps best in the way pharmaceutical companies now advertise directly to the public in a way they never did during the Awakenings period. Sacks is here an articulate proponent for a more human, less coldly analytical medicine, and his endorsement for such an approach, which includes close interpersonal relationships with patients, is a clarion call. Fascinating, meticulous, and highly recommended.One appendix is devoted to the many dramatizations of Awakenings on stage and screen. There's Harold Pinter's one-act play A Kind of Alaska, an original documentary film, and the feature film, which retained Sacks as a consultant. I found his descriptions here of DeNiro preparing for his role as Leonard L. fascinating.",98,21
14456,Awakenings,Megan,"2,047",8,5,"February 18, 2012","Reading this makes me wish all doctors approached medical practice the way Dr. Sacks does. His clinical grasp of neurology is impressive, but his humanity, compassion, and philosophical approach lend him a more effective manner than other clinicians. His ability to present the conditions of his patients and their treatment as more than either/or, as more than a list of data points, is what makes this book a classic. A basic familiarity with neurology makes this an easier read; he uses a lot of medical terms to describe symptoms and treatments. However, he goes beyond symptoms to see how the patients in his care interact with their disease, treatment, and environment as unique individuals. Science in general and medicine in particular have been on a decades-long reductionist trend - as though all conditions can be boiled down to the one gene, the one protein, the one chemical that will take care of it all. In reality, life is too complex for that to work most of the time. Dr. Sack's ability to approach patients as whole, unique beings full of life is the key to his popularity as a physician and writer.",32,1 comment
14456,Awakenings,Zanna,676,927,4,"June 5, 2014","The story is thrilling: the sleepy sickness epidemic that followed WWI left many people with profound Parkinsonian symptoms; some were hardly able to move, never spoke, seemed frozen in time for forty years. A large number of these patients were under Sacks' care at Mount Carmel hopital in New York in 1969 when he decided to try giving them the new drug L-DOPA, and witnessed many of them coming suddenly, vividly to life. But this blurb summary is a gross simplification! Sacks is at pains even in the introductions to point out that L-DOPA is extremely unpredictable, producing different effects even in the same patient, and always leads to some 'tribulations'. Also, the case studies that form the dramatic heart of the book were less fascinating to me than Sacks' writing around them. In a way, the case studies are richly personal: Sacks insists again and again on treating patients as people, that 'nothing can be reduced to anything' and that 'if we do not listen to our patients we will never learn anything'. However, the clinical detail is extensive and given in terminology that takes time to get used to. When Sacks reflects on their implications, in contrast, he writes in expansive, lucid prose, linking the mysteries of Parkinsonism to quantum mechanics and to lyrical, existential poetry.This is a wonderful book for writers, because, as often in Sacks' work, it goes to the heart of what forms character, identity, personality. When he asserts that 'style is the deepest thing in one's being', I am struck by the resonance with some of the most thought-provoking philosophy and criticism I have read. The succinct expression here is powerful, and it is fleshed out by meditations on the notion of health as musicality and free flow, of being as moving, which the 'phantasmagoria' of Parkinsonism most graphically disrupts and distorts.A section on stage and screen interpretations of the original work is included. Sacks, initially concerned that any adaptation would be 'unreal' was delighted by Pinter's response A Kind of Alaska: ""I felt Pinter had given me as much as I gave him: I had given him a reality - and he had given me one back.""Ultimately, Sacks eloquently calls for an existential medicine. Over and over he emphasises how deeply affected patients are by their effective imprisonment in a 'Total Institution' and describes how they respond to music, visitors, trips out, as well as to the physical and care environment, in extraordinary and radical ways. Awakenings allows us to glimpse deep truths about health and disease, and their integrity with personhood, that should transform the ways we think about them.",18,5
14456,Awakenings,Kati,113,7,2,"September 13, 2016","I’m going to try to limit my rating to the quality of the book itself and not the events it portrays. I’m afraid under that criteria I can’t rate Awakenings any better than a ‘2’ for the majority of it, although the portions added in 1982 and 1990 are better written than the original material from 1972. This book has an unfortunate quality of being neither here nor there. Much of the book is filled with highly technical terms and seems that it was not really written with the layman in mind, and yet often Sacks starts waxing philosophical in a way not suitable for a strictly medical case study. He also does a poor job of expressing why he continued trying L-DOPA on new patients despite the large number of often spectacular, sometimes perhaps fatal, failures in this population — failures that happened quite quickly. (Most ‘Awakenings’ lasted only a few days to a few weeks in the luckiest cases and then started to collapse into intolerable agitative symptoms.) His descriptions to me read as though most of the patients ended up worse off after L-DOPA than they were before, a rather impressive feat given how badly off they were to start. The 1982 epilogue suggests there were therapeutic benefits that weren't well described compared to the negative effects, and patients who did better but were not spectacular enough to include in the 20 presented case studies, but some of the included cases still seem grossly irresponsible to me as a reader. The writing also seems as though Sacks at this time fundamentally lacked an of understanding of how other people worked. This is not as strange as it seems at first glance, since Sacks is not a psychologist. He’s a neurologist who has struggled with near-paralyzing shyness. In the additions written in 1982 and 1990 he seems to have outgrown some of that psychological ignorance, but unfortunately the 1972 portion where it is present is the meat of the book. I would also be remiss if I did not mention that the book contains 173 footnotes, many of them essay length. In my opinion, this is just bad writing technique. The material should have either been incorporated into the body of the work, or omitted entirely.",13,N/A
14456,Awakenings,Joanne Annabannabobanna ,37,33,5,"March 24, 2019","Simply astonishing. My first experience with Oliver Sachs, long before any movie. Stumbled across it while browsing a tiny one room library located in the charming community of Vankleek Hill, Ontario where I lived at the time, and immediately became absorbed by the history of the so-called Spanish flu, its effects and the incredible results produced by Sachs' medical intervention. Not least affecting was the eloquence with which Sachs wrote about the patients in his care, provoking intense feelings of empathy and compassion for the patients. Everyone should read this in order to experience the same profound awakening I have, I thought at the time. Then came the movie. As much as I respect Penny Marshall's directing abilities and enjoy some of Robin Williams' work, the movie has to be one of the biggest disappointments of all time, in my book.",13,N/A
14456,Awakenings,Will Ansbacher,296,85,5,"May 16, 2022","After reading fresh references to Awakenings in Oliver Sacks’ last book The River of Consciousness, I was motivated finally to read the original. I had already read many times over the years about his astonishing work with the post-encephalitic (sleepy sickness) patients beginning in the sixties: through various references in his many books, in his wonderful autobiography On the Move, in Lawrence Weschler’s bio  And How are you Dr Sacks?, the 1973 British TV documentary (which I remembered watching with a sense of amazement long before I’d ever heard of Sacks) – and not forgetting the fictionalized film version. But never the original work.So this was a bit of a surprise, though it shouldn’t have been. It was written when he was still a young unknown neurologist and considered somewhat of an eccentric in that field, and it’s addressed to his fellow physicians. You can see his writing style, that later would make him so famous to general audiences, emerging here; it’s precise and literate, yet this work is quite unusual for a medical monograph too, in that the author isn’t at all detached from his subjects. Rather, it is an impassioned and deeply personal account, and Sacks’ empathy, caring and respect for his patients come through strongly, just as it does in his later popularized accounts. The core of the book consists of the fascinating and heart-rending individual case studies of twenty patients who were struck down with sleepy sickness in the epidemic after WW1, institutionalized as their conditions worsened, then abandoned for up to 40 years, and their troubled re-awakening then relapse under the so-called “wonder drug” L-Dopa. But that’s little more than a third of it. There are many other sections, prefaces, prologues and appendices, all with extensive footnotes (Sacks’ hallmark if ever there was one!). They cover the history of sleepy sickness, its relationship to Parkinson’s disease, the nature of wonder drugs and of “punctuated” consciousness (which most of his patients experienced); there are more general perspectives on all the patients (80 or more) that he cared for – how they coped with their disease and the inadequacy of conventional medicine. Epilogues for two later editions in the decades following, relate the progress of the surviving patients (in 1990); there are Addenda as more became known about the effects of L-Dopa on patients with ordinary Parkinson’s Disease (and indicating how prescient Sacks was in the 1960s); a section on abnormal EEG traces; Chaos theory (as it related to the impossibility of finding a tolerable dose of L-Dopa) and so on. There are even references to the Arts - how the documentary came to be made, and a rather moving piece on Sacks’ interactions with Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro during the shooting of the movie.It’s complex and compelling though not an easy read, and full of unfamiliar medical terms (many of which I was pleased to see in my Kobo’s dictionary). In the Preface Sacks says, “Running through the book is a metaphysical theme – the notion that it is insufficient to consider disease in purely mechanical or chemical terms, that it must be considered equally in biological or metaphysical terms,”  and indeed there are extensive references to the works of philosophers such as Nietzsche or Wittgenstein so it’s not “scientific” in the traditional sense of medical works either, and I can see why it was received so coolly by his peers at the time. Overall, what comes across here is Sacks’ total dedication to his patients; it is truly a remarkable thing to experience. BTW, Sacks mentions that he wished he’d been able to somehow include the TV documentary with the case studies. It’s  on Youtube now and is well worth watching.",12,2
14456,Awakenings,Lyn Elliott,669,172,4,"August 18, 2012","This was the first of Sacks's books I read, and I had never read anything like it. The discovery that a chemical could bring 'frozen' people to consciousness again after an apparent sleep of years, was mind blowing to read about - and literally mind blowing for some of those who emerged for a time from the effects of their meningitis and then sank out of consciousness again. Sacks recorded the process as a scientist, and a man who is deeply concerned about the human condition and for his patients as people.It's a long book, but this is necessary to tell the stories of the group who trialled l.Dopa with the insight and compassion Sacks gives them.For me, the film came nowhere near the real meaning of the book, because it only told the story of a very few patients and focused on one. This made for human drama, but lost the scale of the double tragedy.",11,N/A
14456,Awakenings,Jean,"1,699",737,4,"October 13, 2015","Oliver Sacks M.D. was an eminent neurologist. He died in his home in New York City at age 82 in August 2015. Dr. Sacks has written many books but is most famous for his book “Awakenings.” On hearing of his death, I decided to read his book again.In 1966 while working as a neurologist for Mount Carmel Hospital in the Bronx he noted many patients had spent decades in a strange frozen state with some symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. They were the survivors of the 1916-1917 encephalitis (Sleeping Sickness) epidemic that swept the world during World War I. I studied about this epidemic in school but remember seeing patient in this frozen state from the brief epidemic that hit the central states and prairie provinces of Canada in the early 1950s. Sacks treated these patients with an experimental drug called L-dopa, which enabled many of the patients to recover. The book is a collection of stories about the recovery of some of the patients. The book is written using medical terminology so non scientific reads may have a problem with frequent trips to the dictionary.A play by Harold Pinter was successful and a 1990 film starring Robert De Niro and Robin Williams was on the Oscar list. I read this as an audiobook downloaded from Audible. Jonathan Davis did a good job narrating the book.",10,N/A
14456,Awakenings,Laurel,398,170,5,"June 30, 2019","A couple quotes that deeply resonated with me:""Some of these patients had achieved a state of icy hopelessness akin to serenity: a realistic hopelessness, in those pre-dopa days: they knew they were doomed, and they accepted this with all the courage and equanimity they could muster. Other patients (and, perhaps, to some extent, all of these patients, whatever their surface serenity) had a fierce and impotent sense of outrage: they had been swindled out of the best years of life; they were consumed by the sense of time lost, time wasted; and they yearned incessantly for a twofold miracle – not only a cure for their sickness, but an indemnification for the loss of their lives. They wanted to be given back the time they had lost, to be magically replaced in their youth and their prime.""""The terrors of suffering, sickness and death, of losing ourselves and losing the world, are the most elemental and intense we know; and so too are our dreams of recovery and rebirth, of being wonderfully restored to ourselves and the world.”",8,2
14456,Awakenings,Rose,204,5,2,"May 22, 2017","I was excited when my book group selected this book, as I remembered loving the feature film it inspired. However, my enthusiasm was quickly dampened within the first several pages -- not because of the content, but because of the writing style I encountered. The text is so full of medical jargon and clinical explanations (including footnoted expansions of the text which often take up close to or more than half of the printed page) that reading it was WORK, not pleasure. After the introductory material and the first 8 of the patient case histories, I moved on to the supplemental material about how director Penny Marshall and actors Robin Williams and Robert De Niro prepared for the feature film. That part, at least, was readable -- and quite enjoyable, especially as I had just re-watched the movie the night before.It's evident to me that Dr. Sacks had a far different audience in mind as he was writing this book than the general reading public. If he intended this book to be read by a wider audience than those in the medical sciences, he either missed the mark or was grossly misled by his editor in thinking he had reached it. I found the subject matter fascinating, but obscured by the language he used to report his experiments with using L-Dopa as treatment for post-encephalitis lethargica patients. The book reads like a clinical journal, not a story. And while the book is titled ""Awakenings,"" neither the patients nor Dr. Sacks himself comes to life on the page. Although the movie is not an exactly accurate portrayal of this amazing event in the history of treating Parkinsonian-like symptoms and victims who had been catatonic for 30 years of more, it is a more human, enlightening treatment of Dr. Sacks's work with these people. I'd suggest seeing the movie first, then reaching for the book as additional reference material if you want to try to learn more about the experiment or the encephalitis-lethargica pandemic of the 1920s. I had such high hopes for this book. Sadly, they were dashed. Perhaps another writer somewhere can turn this report into a narrative which more of us can appreciate, because the story of what happened is certainly worth telling -- and reading about.",6,3
14456,Awakenings,Ian,691,65,4,"April 1, 2017","I am struggling to find words to describe my feelings of amazement at the case histories set out in this book, and my wonderment at what a strange place the mind can be. For anyone unaware of the background, in the sixties Dr. Sacks worked with survivors of an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica that began in Central Europe in 1916 and lasted for about 10 years, affecting an estimated 5 million people worldwide. In the severest cases, such as Dr. Sacks’ patients, survivors were left in a near catatonic state, behaving with near total apathy and indifference to the world around them. By the 1960s it had been established that the victims of post-encephalitic conditions were lacking the neurotransmitter dopamine, and the drug L-Dopa was developed in an attempt to compensate. Initially the results were startling, with patients who had been profoundly ill for decades suddenly “awakening”, sometimes within hours of receiving L-Dopa. Unfortunately, within a few weeks a large majority of the patients began to manifest new illnesses, the variety and complexity of which are too great for this review. Overall, L-Dopa’s effect on patients ranged from the beneficial to the catastrophic. The story is told through 20 individual case histories presented by the author, followed by a variety of reflections, postscripts and appendices, where Dr Sacks makes the case against a “mechanistic” approach to medicine, and the tendency to treat patients as replicas of each other (the book was written in 1972, so this argument was probably more radical then than it sounds now). Dr. Sacks is eloquent in drawing conclusions, but at times I found his detailed arguments quite dense, and his writing style a bit too florid for my taste. It’s for this reason that I haven’t given the book a 5-star rating. It deserves that in every other aspect.In 1990 the book was made into a film starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro. The last of the appendices provides a fascinating account of the making of the film. I haven’t seen it, but will look out for it now.",6,2
14456,Awakenings,PJ Who Once Was Peejay,198,24,5,"March 16, 2012","This is a true story about people who became prisoners of their own brains, their own brain chemistry. Just after World War I an epidemic of sleeping sickness froze these patients in a trance-like state. Long thought to be untreatable, they were suddenly brought back to life in 1969 when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the drug L-DOPA. They woke to a world that had changed utterly in the intervening years. Some of them were able to adjust, some could not deal with the changes in the world and in themselves and lapsed back into their frozen state.But this isn't just a sad story. There's also something numinous about this book. It's far more profound and amazing than the movie that it's based upon it. That was a good movie, but the Robert DeNiro character--as is a necessity when condensing a book for film--is really a composite of many people. What makes the book so much deeper and richer are the many stories of the patients Oliver Sacks deals with, how their spirits soared, or didn't, what it means to be a human being. Their struggles to come out of the horrific consequences of their disease into a new life are a testament to the human spirit, both positive and negative. Sacks' writing is as profound as the story he tells.",5,N/A

It is full of personal moments of extreem grief and happiness and wonder. It is a story of clinical experimentation and individual care and understanding.A very good film of it has also been made with Robin Williams as Oliver Sacks.
