2094,A Briefer History of Time,Cait Poytress,256,253,5,"April 19, 2010","There's nothing like the contemplation of the universe for making one feel simultaneously awe struck and incredibly insignificant.Kind of random, but I loved Hawking's frequent use of the exclamation mark. For example::""However, when an antiparticle and a particle meet, they annihilate each other. So if you meet your antiself, don't shake hands - you would both vanish in a great flash of light!""and""The supermassive black hole has a star orbiting it at about 2 percent the speed of light, faster than the average speed of an electron orbiting the nucleus in an atom!""His pure excitement regarding the subject matter and specific points being made is almost palpable. I wanted to yell ""Preach it, Mr. Hawking! Science is awesome!""I also learned, much to my surprise, that the world apparently doesn't revolve around me. ",81,10
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Chaplain Walle,380,18,5,"June 19, 2022","This is a very good book about moddern day physics. It answers a lot of the questions of the universe in a clear and concise fassion, so the laiman has no problem understanding. I highly recommend this book.",26,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Tharindu Dissanayake,275,457,5,"July 6, 2020","""WE LIVE IN A STRANGE AND wonderful universe.""In 'A Briefer History of Time,' the authors have been successful in making good on their promise to deliver a simplified version of original book, to provide the general reader with some understanding of the universe.In this well laid out book, reader is guided through the major scientific theories that are in existence today. Relativity, Curved Space, and Quantum Gravity are given much weight and the strengths and weaknesses of each are presented with very clear examples.Though a longtime student of physics might find the content to be simple, it is certainly the excellent for the non-scientist, who I believe are the intended audience of this book. ""A complete, consistent, unified theory is the only first step: out goal is a complete understanding of the events around us, and of our own existence.""",26,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Briynne,585,52,5,"July 11, 2008","Wow and wow. I am not by nature a science person. The largely-repressed memories I have of high school chemistry still make me feel a little ill. But this, friends, is more like reading poetry than it is like reading a textbook. I am officially in awe of Stephen Hawking - the man can actually make you feel about subatomic particles and forces of nature. It's nothing short of amazing, really. I don't pretend to understand 99% of what the book discusses beyond an extremely superficial level, but I was moved by the beauty and grandeur Hawking breathes into his subject. Don't be put off, fellow arts majors. This is a phenomenal book. ",16,2
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Nərmin,523,162,3,"January 2, 2017","""A briefer history of time"" is briefer and simpler version of ""A brief history of time"". However I wish explanations to some theories made sense to me. I still feel unfullfilled about string theory and multi dimensions.In addition, the language was a bit dry, or so I thought. After Carl Sagan's flowing poetry-like language, I am unimpreed by Stephen Hawking. Still humor wasn't absent.Apart from those, I liked this book. Got good deal of information and understanding of theories. After reading science themed books, especially ones dealing with cosmos, you can't help but feel smaller and meaningless. However it also fuels your curiosity about universe and science. I really like popular science books and how they are great ways to understand science and even got even deeper. 3.5☆",11,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Anto,30,54,5,"April 28, 2019","I began watching Neil Degrasse Tyson's Cosmos last year and it rekindled my interest in learning about physics and astronomy. It began when I watched Carl Sagan's Cosmos, which I loved. So Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time caught my eye. While I excelled in other subjects, my physics teacher in school didn't exactly make the topic interesting so I was never really good at it. No enthusiasm engendered there. When I learned that there was a Briefer History of Time, I opted for that one because of my relative ignorance in the subject.In the first chapters, I feared I should have chosen the Brief version instead, because it was kind of 4 Dummies and I didn't need that much explaining to understand it. I was still learning new concepts though, so it kept me going. Later on it gradually gained complexity with every passing chapter, but the preceding chapters prepare you well for them. There's a certain satisfaction in knowing you wouldn't have gotten all of what you're reading if you had skipped the preceding chapters. When you think of how you would share this with other people, you realize that it would take some time because you'd need to explain from beginning to end.It's not an over-complicated book you have to waddle through and put down every 30 minutes to digest. The concepts are engaging enough and the path to them is easy and smooth. In the end it is not at 4 dummies, you need to have read the preceding chapters to understand it if you're new to the subject. Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow wrote this in a really enthusiastic way so as a reader you will be excited too.Well, to summarize this, as someone who started out being pretty ignorant in physics, I'm glad I had a pleasant, fun experience out of becoming better informed on a fascinating subject, including topics like Special and General Relativity, Quantum Theory, and String Theory. I recommend it to pretty much anyone over the age of 12 who doesn't know much about these subjects. This is for beginners. If you're thinking of buying this for someone who has already been enthusiastic about this subject for a while, even if they're 13, chances are they won't get so much out of this and you should get a recommendation for the next step of depth.",10,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Jim,"2,736",55,3,"February 21, 2013","In an attempt to prove to some recent mega-brainiac friends (not that they asked me) that I was capable of some limited understanding of physics, I picked up this slim volume. The result: my brain hurts, I learned a few things, and I humbly submit that I will stay in the humanities. Although I think I got most of it, I nonetheless find it hard to accept certain things. I need some time-travel pills, as I am queasy. A lot of this material I learned in school or absorbed over time in media (and Star Trek), though the advance of years washed away much of it, but this book was easy enough for a proto-geek like myself (that is like a cro-magnon scientist compared to the smarts of people I know) to have some limited understanding and to enjoy, though there are still sections that are blank in my mind. Did I read them? I am not sure. I think Hawking is just playing with me, like a mega-brain cat swatting around an insignificant cricket. Luckily, I don't think he plans on crushing me. And it was somewhat comforting to understand that, like me, the universe is still expanding. I was disheartened to learn we cannot achieve light-speed. Now, I think I will return to previously scheduled fiction (maybe some fantasy). ",10,1 comment
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Chadi Raheb,304,338,4,"July 22, 2022",Or:What a semi-beginner physics lover can learn about time and space in a nutshell.P.S.This is an updated version of A Brief History of Time.,10,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,S.Baqer Al-Meshqab,323,100,4,"March 29, 2016","Imagine you are a tiny particle, one that lived throughout the universe since the beginning of time. You witnessed the dawn of creation, and within you lie the rules with which the end can be foreseen. You are fully aware of the characteristics of space-time. Relativity & Quantum Mechanics are nothing but infant struggles to identify you and your behavior. You could even be a string! But nobody can say for sure, for only you have that knowledge. You gaze at the human race along the path of time, laughing: They still don't know. But you praise their efforts in their quest to understand it all. Such is the magnificence of a bewildering world. Warning: For a beginner in the field of physics, going through this book may not be an easy task. (It was not, for me) In spite of being relatively short, it requires a great deal of concentration. Nevertheless, I can assure you, it is remarkably MIND BLOWING. A Briefer History of Time does not tell the story of creation, at least not entirely. It outlines, however, the scientific theories, observations, and discoveries by which one can try to understand how things are they way they are. Starting with the basic definition of the Scientific Theory, and ending with the dilemma of String Theories, the authors tackle some interesting topics regarding the nature of space and time, realized by a different set of theories initiated by different scientists; like Newton, Einstein, and Heisenberg, during a long course of human history. They will shed some light on the big bang, the black holes, the forces that govern the universe and its components, worm holes and even time travel! Despite all that is known up to date, some things still remain a mystery. Don't expect the book to give you a happy, clear ending, for nowadays theories are not able to explain everything, as they are still not completely compatible. The future, however, is a head of us, and we might, one day, find the one grand ultimate theory which can unveil the curtains to the unknown.Or can we not? ",9,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Rusty,191,16,3,"January 29, 2010","To begin, I am not….scientifically inclined. But I would like to get a better grasp on some scientific principles, so I thought I would give this book a whirl. I didn’t grasp everything, by any means, but the book is very informative. I found it very interesting to learn how little/much physicists know about the universe, its properties, and the struggle to find natural governing laws that consistently prove true. I feel that I’ve learned a great deal from this book, and will probably read it again, at some future date, to try to absorb a little more. And I’m grateful that Mr. Hawking took the time to dumb down “A Brief History of Time”, because I don’t know that I’d ever tackle that one. ",9,N/A
2094,A Briefer History of Time,Nicola Michelle,948,5,4,"July 13, 2020","As a lover of A Brief History of Time, I absolutely loved the idea of A Briefer History of Time! It was a nice, succinct sum up of all the brilliance and amazing-ness of the original book and is a great refresher of the longer version. I have nothing but respect for science books who can communicate quite difficult concepts to all varieties of readers and this book is great for doing that. It also has many brilliant pictures and illustrations to further reinforce points and overall it’s just a great book to read!",8,N/A
