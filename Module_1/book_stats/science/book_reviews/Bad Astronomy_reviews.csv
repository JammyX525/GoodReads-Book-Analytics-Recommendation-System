23518,Bad Astronomy,Leslie,108,3,3,"October 26, 2012","Funny, entertaining, informative. Most of the stuff I already knew (I used to teach high school science), but I learned a few things, too.My only complaint came on page 16: ""That makes sense; the yolk is really the embryo of the chicken and shouldn't get jostled too much."" This is not true. The embryo only grows if the egg is fertilized, and it starts as a small dot ON the yolk. The yolk provides food for the growing chick. I guess I need to write a book called ""Bad Biology""!",33,1 comment

  ""Do you see the pattern? First the Earth was the center of everything-hurrah! Then, well, ahem. Maybe the Sun still is-yay! But then, yikes, actually we’re way out in the suburbs of the [Milky Way] Galaxy. Well, this was getting downright insulting.""
A casual spin of the Google directory returns over 600,000 results for “moon landing hoax.” Naturally, some portion of these hits are by the debunkers, those war-torn heroes who continue to throw logic and sense at the convinced conspiracy cults. Yet even discounting the lights of reason embedded in these results, the fact remains that far too many still believe that America’s voyage to the moon was no voyage at all: 6% of Americans, to be precise.At first brush, and consumed without much in the way of science literacy, some of the doubts offered by hoaxers can sound marginally compelling. But first glances can be deceiving. And be warned: If you do wade into this cesspool of credulity, you may find yourself in contact with ideas that would make Roswell truthers blush. ‘The whole moon itself is faked and is projected onto the sky using the same technology used to project the Bat Signal’. Or something just as otherwordly. Conspiracy wonks are nothing if not creative, but you may find such departures from Reality unfit for public consumption. Don’t venture too long.To be sure, collapsing the arguments of moon landing deniers requires little more than a healthy dose of common sense infused with trace amounts of scientific acumen. They might try the following on for size:1. Experts spanning the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and photography all say we've been to the moon, and it’s usually a good idea to defer to experts on matters in which you are, in fact, not one.2. Global conspiracy theories on the scale necessary to fake a moon landing are probably infeasible given how many people would need to stay silent, from the hundreds of thousands of NASA engineers who worked on the Apollo project for nearly 10 years, the staging crews who fabricated and processed the footage for six different manned landings, the 12 men who claimed to have walked on the moon and the other astronauts who flew with them, and finally to the chain of command terminating with the Oval Office.3. If the Soviet Union had the slightest inkling of imposture, they would have trumpeted it from the rooftops to the stars. We were, after all, waging an international space race at the time.4. Photographic chicanery of the type required to spoof a moon landing did not exist.5. Along with much third-party evidence, in recent years orbiting spacecraft have captured photos of the landing sites, the tracks left by the Apollo astronauts, and various remnants of the lunar surface experiments they conducted.If exercising logic and countering similarly pseudoscientific moonshine is something you work into regular rotation, you'll find Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Astrology to the Moon Landing “Hoax” crowded with thrills and long on ammunition. In a way, this is the book Phil Plait, award-winning blogger and skeptic superstar, was always meant to write. The topics covered are the very ones he’s written vibrantly about for more than a decade on his blog of the same name (now appearing on Slate). Fans of his work will be accustomed to the serviceable combination of wit, humor, and academic rigor directed at popular misinformation. His easily digestible tome is in this sense perfectly continuous with his veteran crusade to debunk all manner of ‘bunk’.Astronomy is Plait’s specialty, and his breadth of the stars is staggering. Sure, much of the information on offer here is a Google search away, but the comedic, accessible format and the assortment of diverse but neatly divisioned topics prove to be the book’s redeeming qualities. And along with a pulverizing exposé on moon landing conspiracy theories, about a quarter of the way into the book you’re treated with one of the best, if not the best, layman explanations of how tides work. Given all of the half-explanations and untruths swirling around online on this topic (Plait notes that even many textbooks have it wrong), it’s refreshing to read a comprehensive breakdown of tidal physics that even an amateur can regurgitate. His deconstructions really are that good.“The essence of science is that it makes its own improvements: A theory is only as good as its next prediction.” (p. 20)While we cannot be faulted for it, most of us live out our day entirely ignorant of the celestial wonders that loom just beyond the horizon. The sun, and the planets that race around it, each with its loyal retinue of moon or moons, all dance to intricate patterns and are governed by a dense filigree of physical relationships. Plait does a great job of exposing the profundity of the stars to which we are so often oblivious while putting to bed a few of the most pervasive inaccuracies lodged in our modern consciousness.As it turns out, the seasons are not caused by the sun’s intensity or by its distance from the earth. The moon is not larger near the horizon than when it’s high overhead. Lunar phases are not the result of the earth’s shadow dynamics. The sky is not blue because it reflects the color of the oceans. And, far from proving that no man has stepped foot on the surface of the moon, the fact that there are no stars in the Apollo 11 photographs simply shows that NASA knew how to work a camera. Plait’s treatments are precise, no-nonsense and layered with enthusiasm.Some chapters are less memorable than others: why you can balance an egg on its end any day of the year; why you can’t glimpse stars in daylight; and why astrology carries as much science cred as Harry Potter struck me as less than revelatory. However, the sections on the the Hubble Space Telescope, the ""Velikovsky affair,"" the Big Bang—perhaps the most frequently misconceived of scientific theories—and his entertaining finale on bad astronomy in film all earn high marks.Closing ThoughtsIf you find science synonymous with entertainment, then Bad Astronomy is for you, especially if you’re already familiar with Phil Plait’s online persona. Not merely the arch-critic of pseudoscience, Plait is one of the few educators I know of who can graft humor onto science without falling victim to oversimplification or pulling from the standard bag of clichés. You won’t just learn that the sky is blue because the earth’s atmosphere scatters blue light more than other wavelengths, or that 2001: A Space Odyssey is the most scientifically authentic space movie ever. You’ll also obtain a wonderful introduction to the underlying principles of astronomy and appreciate the admixture of humor throughout. Plait’s book, his first, is an exercise in clear thinking fused with good science, necessities surely foreign to the moon landing deniers. Highly recommended.Note: This review is republished from my official website.",24,18
23518,Bad Astronomy,Paul,"2,306",20,4,"June 13, 2021","This is an excellent book, written in an informal, often very witty style, that makes for an easy, entertaining read. In the Mythbusters vein, the author presents a number of the most widely misunderstood aspects of astronomy in a way that clearly explains why these misunderstandings occur and explains the actual facts behind them.The reason I haven’t given this 5 stars is because I question who this book is for. You see, I don’t think the people who really need to read this book would ever actually pick it up and read it. Either that or, if they did, it would just result in a bunch of 1 star ‘burn the heretic’ type reviews because people simply don’t like to be told they’re wrong.Because of this, I think this book (and others of its type) end up being read, for the most part, by people like me, who know 90% of the material already, leading to an unattractive feeling of smugness and a false sense of superiority which isn’t, in my opinion, a good thing to cultivate.If I thought for a second this book would actually change people’s minds about some of the nonsense the author debunks, I’d give it 5 stars all the way. Perhaps I’m just too cynical.My next book: Marvel Masterworks: The Black Panther vol. 1",19,4
23518,Bad Astronomy,Becky,"1,308",1595,3,"March 22, 2015","Really interesting, and at times pretty funny. I really enjoyed this book, and think that Plait did a good job at laying explaining the misconceptions, poking a little fun at them, and then debunking them with good solid science. He doesn't claim that science knows everything, but he does show how easy it is to see that some of the things that are believed to be true because they are part of the cultural ""knowledge"" - like that an egg will only stand on its end on the vernal equinox. You could easily try it at ANY OTHER TIME and disprove that. He goes over quite a lot of topics in the book, from what the Hubble Space Telescope actually is to how sci-fi movies and books get things wrong to make them more exciting and familiar, to the intricacies of naming things that fall from the sky (meteor/meteorite) and how the phases of the moon work. He talks about why we have seasons, and why creationist 'science' isn't. And astrology. The astrology section was especially funny to me, because I'm a cynical skeptic who had to sit next to a 'star-child' for about two years at my last job. She'd tell me about her horoscope and how bad things were happening in the world because whatchamajig was in its 4th equilateral ascendancy or suchlike. I'd just nod and pretend like what she'd said sounded like English. I didn't know that there was a Bad Astronomy website until after I'd listened to the majority of the book. Close to the end, he lists the top 10 mistakes commonly used in sci-fi movies set in space or dealing with aliens, etc. He also mentioned that he does movie reviews there, which made me wonder whether he had reviewed Gravity, which I watched recently. He has not, as of yesterday. A shame, I'd like to see what he thought of how they did that one. And Leviathan Wakes. I'd like to hear his opinion on those. Finally, a word about the reader... I thought he was just OK. There were some times in the narration that his cadence was a little off, making partial sentence fragments sound like they were their own sentences. It was strange. And he did accents for some parts of it, like when quoting another astronomer who was English, etc. That was weird, too. Still, as a whole, it was good, but if I had known I could, I would likely have just read the site. ;) ",13,3
23518,Bad Astronomy,Claudia,942,502,4,"August 6, 2017","If you are familiar with documentaries about the universe, then you most certainly know Phil Plait. His enthusiasm and funny way to popularize science made him one of the most beloved astronomers known today. At least, he is one of my favorites.This book is no exception: like in his TV appearances, he does an excellent job explaining various misconceptions or myths related to our known universe. You can also take a look at his blog, http://www.badastronomy.com/index.html and see if it catches your interest. Or maybe below fragments will:”It's too easy to simply accept what you're told. This is extraordinarily dangerous. If you just assume without thinking critically that someone is right, you may be voting for the wrong politician, or accepting a doctrine that has a bad premise, or buying a used car that might kill you. Science is a way of distinguishing good data from bad. Practicing science is wonderful. It makes you think about things, and thinking is one of the best things you can do.”“Meteors are a major source of bad astronomy. When two eighteenth-century Yale scientists proposed that meteors were coming from outer space, one wag responded, ""I would more easily believe that two Yankee professors would lie than that stones would fall from heaven."" That wag was Thomas Jefferson. Thankfully, he stuck to other things like founding the University of Virginia (my alma mater) and running the country, and steered clear of astronomy.”“When you actually do the math, you find that the effect of Jupiter's gravity on the Earth is only about 1 percent of the Moon's! Despite the old saying, size doesn't matter; distance does.”Interesting, witty, amusing; great read!",12,2
23518,Bad Astronomy,Chris,341,950,4,"January 21, 2010","What do you think you know about astronomy? For example, what causes us to have seasons? If you said that it's our distance from the sun - sorry, you're wrong. Or how about why the sky is blue? If you think it's that the sky reflects the sea, nope. Wrong again. Or perhaps you think that the moon's tidal effect makes people crazy, or that an egg can only stand on end if it's the Vernal Equinox or that an alignment of the planets will cause a terrible buildup of gravity that will kill us all!All wrong. But you would not be alone. For a society as technologically advances as ours (and if you're reading this, then chances are good that you live in a technologically advanced society), the general public has a big problem with science. People see it as being too hard to understand, or too removed from their daily lives. Politicians bemoan the fact that American schoolchildren are falling behind in science, but science funding is almost always on the list of cuts that can be made to save money. We love technology, but hate science, and that is a path to certain doom.Of all the sciences, though, astronomy is perhaps the worst understood. A lot of people still confuse it with astrology, which is probably a huge part of the problem right there. For millennia, we have thought about the planets and stars as celestial things, unknown and unknowable by such base creatures as ourselves. It's only in the last hundred years or so that we've been able to rapidly improve our understanding of the universe, and popular knowledge hasn't caught up with that yet.And so bad misconceptions of astronomy persist in the public imagination.Fortunately, we have people like Phil Plait to set the record straight, and that is indeed what he does in this book.While there are many educators out there who believe that a wrong idea, once implanted, is impossible to eradicate, Plait sees it as a teachable opportunity. Take, for example, the commonly held belief that on the Vernal Equinox - and only on the Vernal Equinox - you can balance an egg on its end. Many people believe this, and it's an experiment that's carried out in classrooms around the country every March. Teachers tell their students, and the local news media tell their viewers, but no one stops to ask Why. Why would this day, of all the days in the year, be so special? More importantly, how can we test that assertion?Fortunately, that's within the powers of any thinking individual, and it should be the first thing teachers do once they've finished having fun balancing eggs: try and do it again the next day. If you can balance an egg on March 30th, or May 22nd or August 12th, or any other day of the year, then you have successfully proven the Equinox Egg Hypothesis wrong. Congratulations! You're doing science!!Or perhaps you've heard the story that you can see starts from the bottom of a well, or a tall smokestack. This is because, the idea goes, the restricted amount of light will not wash out the stars so much, giving you a chance to do some daytime astronomy. Well, there's an easy way to test this one too, if you have an old factory or something of that nature nearby. What you'll discover is that no matter how much you try to restrict your view of the sky, it'll still be washed out and you won't see any stars at all.One more good one that a lot of people believe - the moon is larger in the sky when it's near the horizon than when it's at its zenith. Again, this is something that's very easy to test. Go out as the full moon is rising, looming large in the sky, and hold up an object at arm's length - a pencil is usually recommended. Make a note of the moon's apparent size as compared to the eraser. Then go out again when the moon is high in the sky and repeat your observation. The moon appears to be the same size, no matter how it may look to you.Of course, there's a lot of science into why these things are the way they are. The chicken egg thing is because there's no singular force that is only acting on chicken eggs and only doing so on one day of the year (which is not even universally regarded as the first day of spring). As for the inability to see stars in the daytime, that's because our pesky atmosphere scatters a lot of the light coming from the sun, so light appears to come from everywhere in the sky. The only thing you're likely to see in a blue sky is the moon, and MAYBE Venus, if you're really sharp-eyed and lucky. The Moon Illusion is not well-understood, actually. It's probably not the brain comparing the moon with objects on the horizon - the effect works at sea, too. It's probably a combination of competing psychological effects that deal with distance, none of which can accurately deal with how far away the moon is. Regardless, all of these things are easily testable by anyone. The problem is that so few people take that extra time to actually test them., or even think that they should.There are some myths and misconceptions that take a little more expertise to explain, such as why tides and eclipses happen, how seasons occur and why the moon goes through phases. But these explanations aren't very difficult and are well within the understanding of any intelligent adult. Unfortunately, there are a lot of myths that are stubborn, entrenched into the heads of people everywhere and very hard to get out. Not the least of these are the belief that UFOs are alien spacecraft and that we never went to the Moon.Interestingly enough, both of these rest on the same basic problem: we can't rely on our own brains to accurately interpret the data that we see. Plait recounts a story where he was mesmerized by some strange lights in the night sky while watching a 3 AM shuttle launch. They seemed to hover in place, making strange noises, and it wasn't until they got much closer that he was able to see them for what they were: a group of ducks that were reflecting spotlights off their feathers.Our brains believe things, and interpret the observations to fit those beliefs. So when the dust on the moon doesn't behave the way we expect dust to behave, some people believe that to be evidence of fraud, rather than the natural behavior of dust on the moon. We are creatures of story, which is why we like conspiracy theories and astrology. We want the world to make a kind of narrative sense, so often the first explanation we come up with is a story that sounds good. Unfortunately, just because the story sounds good, that doesn't make it true.He also takes a swipe at bad movie science, but in a good-natured manner. Even he admits that movies are more likely to favor story over science, but there are some common errors that make it into so many science fiction films - sound in space, people dodging lasers, deadly asteroid fields - these things may be dramatically interesting, but they're all bad science. And while it would be annoying and pedantic to pick out every example of how the rules are bent for sci-fi (""Please. Why would the aliens come all the way to Earth to steal water when it exists in abundance out in the Kuiper Belt? I scoff at your attempt!""), they do offer an excellent opportunity to teach people about how science works.One of the things I've always liked about Plait is his obvious enthusiasm for not just astronomy but for science in general. Here we have this excellent system to cut through the lies our brains tell us and get closer to knowing what's actually going on. Science forces us to question our assumptions, look at things from many points of view, and arrive at a conclusion that best describes the phenomenon we're observing. When Plait talks about science, he is not condescending or dry or super-intellectual, the way so many people imagine scientists to be. He's excited that he gets to use this amazing tool for understanding the universe, and he wants other people to use it.If you're an astronomy buff, like myself, you probably won't learn much new information from this book. But hopefully you'll be re-invigorated to go out there and look at the world through a scientific, skeptical eye, and you'll be willing to confront these misconceptions when next you come across them. Even better, you might start thinking about what else you think you know, and how you can go about testing it.",5,N/A
23518,Bad Astronomy,Brian,647,77,3,"August 30, 2016","I don't have much to say about this book. It's competently done, but I wasn't particularly satisfied with it even though it did cover some misconceptions I didn't realize I held (that the Earth's shadow causes the moon's phases, for example).I think my biggest problem was with the book's tone. It's extremely conversational, and Plait frequently illustrates his points with metaphors. This isn't automatically a problem, but after a while they were so frequent that they started to interrupt the flow of the text. What I remember most isn't the various mistaken ideas about astronomy, but the description of regolith as being like flour, or that stars twinkle for the same reason that distant blacktops look reflective on hot days. The most valuable parts for me were not the dealings with astronomy, but the ruminations on skepticism and the scientific method, and how it's easy for even someone used to looking at things critically to accept something without thought if they aren't careful. It certainly reinvigorated my desire to read The Demon-Haunted World.",5,N/A

I didn't listen to this book to find out what science/astronomy misconceptions I've been harboring; I listened to it to find out what misconceptions are out there. Some I've heard before.

I'm a big fan of his ""Astronomy"" at Crash Course; he installed his art of teaching, simple explanation, jokes and especially enthusiasm into each of his videos, which can easily absorb viewers' interest amd attention. Back to the book, he pointed out and clarified a number of misconceptions related to astronomy, some of which proved that I had been mistaken all along. From the moon landing, to astrology and bad science in Hollywood science fiction movies push me to continue reading, in this case listening to audio book, with curiosity and awe.

23518,Bad Astronomy,Lis Carey,"2,134",92,4,"November 19, 2020","This is Phil Plait's first book, born out of his Bad Astronomy website, and it's an excellent and entertaining takedown of, as it says on the label, bad astronomy. He takes on many popular misunderstandings and misrepresentations of astronomical facts and realities.Why is the sky really blue? Are meteorites hot enough to cause fires when they hit the ground? Can you see stars during the day if you are at the bottom of a well?Plait takes on creationism, astrology, and UFOs, as well as bad science in movies and television. He talks about the Hubble telescope, and what it can and can't do, and why its data is not released publicly for a year after after collection.I especially enjoyed the chapter dealing with the moon landing ""hoax"" (spoiler: yes, we really did land on the moon). Also quite interesting is the discussion of Velikovsky's crazy theory about Venus being ejected from Jupiter towards the inner solar system, and causing many of the dramatic events recorded in the Bible, such as when Joshua is reported to have stopped the sun in the sky for a full day. There are many reasons this doesn't make sense, but, really, read or listen to Plait's explanation.Plait does a great job of making this entertaining, educational, and just really interesting. At times it's clear the nonsense that gets presented as plausible science makes him really cranky, but he's also very clear about how much he has enjoyed science fiction tv and movies with really bad science, and how it got him interested in real science and a career in astronomy.The book was originally published in 2002, and is naturally a little dated in some respects. That's mostly in ways such as talking about the space shuttle as still an active part of our space program, and other relatively minor details. And if you catch him out in something more significant that scientific research since 2002 has proven wrong, well, he'd say, ""Good!"" He'd be delighted you're paying attention to scientific progress, and science's natural self-correcting features.Recommended.I bought this audiobook.",1 like,1 comment

23518,Bad Astronomy,Mohamed al-Jamri,174,110,3,"December 30, 2016","My notes while reading the book:Likes all space movies, including the stupid ones. Wanted to visit space. Criticizes their inaccuracies. Media misleads about science too.Being ignorant about science is not ok; it is dangerous. pseudoscience is so widespread. Science hits back with Discovery channel, Bill Nye, NASA website etc.People want to read about science; they are curious.""The truth can be hard, and so sometimes it really is easier to believe in fiction. Othertimes the tale has just enough of the ring of truth that you may not question it.""Starting with known misconceptions is a good way to get people's attention and then correct them. Start with scenes from movies for instance and take it to real astronomy.Part 1: Bad Astronomy begins at homeChapter 1: Egg balancing and the equinox.Legend of eggs balancing on Spring Equinox (21 March). Explains scientifically how to balance an egg, says it can work on any day, explain away the pseudoscientific rubbish and traces the origins of the legend.Importance of experimentation and taking account of both positive and negative results. Don't just believe without critical thinking. This is the essence of science.Chapter 2: Flushed with embarrassment, the coriolis effect and your bathroom.Speed of rotation of Earth at different latitudes. Coriolis effect is weak over small distances. Its effects are seen in weather, long distances and long periods of time (e.g. typhoons).Exposes the fakes.Chapter 3: Idioms. Bad Astronomy in everyday language.Light year is a unit of distance not time or speed. ""light speed ahead"" ""light years fast"". Parsec is another astronomical unit.Shooting stars are not stars, but meteorite (when it hits the groud), meteores (when in sky).""Dark side of the moon"". The near side and far side of the moon. The moon is locked by the Earth and always give it the same face. Deep craters in the poles of the moon may be always dark.""Quantum leep ahead of"". History of QM. Quantum leep is a quantum jump, really small.Part 2: From the Earth to the MoonChapter 4: Why is the sky blue[I know this in some detail due to just reading QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter].Shows that flase explainations are wrong. Explains it slowly starting from sun light spectrum.[He explains it better than Feynman, but without going into details.]Why blue and not violet? Blue is more emitted from Sun and your eyes are more sensitive to blue too.Why the Sun looks yellow when it's really white?Why the sea look blue: because it absorbs all over colors and only let blue through.Acknowledging you don't known and asking questions is the way forward to progress.Chapter 5: A dash of seasonsMisconception due to knowing that Earth orbit is elliptical/oval and getting closer to a hear source makes you feel hotter. However this is not the reason of having seasons, just think about the difference between north and south hemispheres.Earth axis tilted 23.5° degrees. It moves cyclically a little every year in what is known as ""procession"". 13 thousand years in future the polar bear won't be the one in the north due to this. Taking this in calculations is very important for telescopes.Chapter 6: The moon changing faceNot due to being in Earth's shadow. Describes the phases and then explain them clearly and their twists too.Chapter 7: The moon and the tideTidal forces. Why there are 2 tidal waves. Solid ground and air are also affected by the moon. The moon is 2/3 of the story; Sun also plays a part in tides: 1/3 of that. Sometimes both are in line, sometimes opposite. This leads to complicating the tide force.Earth is 80 times as massive as Moon. Moon's gravity is 16.6% of Earth's. The Earth has a tidal force on the Moon, it slowed its rotation speed and made it equivalent to its rotation speed around Earth, i.e. it locked it, making it show one face to Earth only.Tidal evolution between Earth and Moon, each of them slowing the rotation of the other and eventually being locked to each other after billions of years.Jupiter exerts huge tidal forces (which lead to tidal friction) on its Moon Ayawa, causing volcanic activity (molten interior).Tidal forces are also felt between galaxies.Chapter 8: The Big Moon illusionThe Moon looks bigger when in the horizon than when it climbs up in the sky. Not due to Moon getting closer (it's 6,000 miles closer when in top), not due to lensing by atmosphere (it is the same size; the increase is just an illusion).The cause behind this is psychological. The illusion is similar to the 2 lines above each other; they are of same length, but we perceive one to be longer, because our brain thinks it's located further and thus adjusts our understanding and makes it us think that it is really longer (just located futher away).Ibn al-Haytham (referred to as Al Hazan) might have got the reason behind this. Earth is flat and we perceive the sky to be flat too, which leads to us thinking the horizon is much further than it really this and just like explained above.This is also known as the Ponzo illusion.Our perception doesn't alwaya match reality.Part 3: Skies at night are big and DMeteorites, Eclipes and the Big Bang.Chapter 9: Why stars twinkleAtmosphere plays part, refraction due to diferent temperatures of its layers. [what about the dimming due to distance? this would make photons come one by one, therefore stars would twinkle too].Planets can sometimes twinkle too in really bad seeing conditions.To get over the problems of seeing, we can send telescopes to space (e.g. Hubble), use short exposure images to construct the full one, or use the Adaptive Optics (e.g. the Very Large Telescope in Chile).Chapter 10: Stars of many colorsHow stars work. History of this discovery. Max Plank, Quanta, peak light depends on temperature.Colors can sometimes not be seen clearly by eye due to cons in eye not being activated. Telescopes help get over this.Chapter 11: The difficulty of day time star seeingMaybe just the two most brightest stars and 4 planets can be seen from a Chimney during day. The chance is really slim.Seeing stars in day light is a legend.Chapter 12: The brightest star polarisPolaris is not the bightest star in sky; Sirius is. Polaris is among the top 50 though. Venus can look like a bright star.Celestial poles, northern and southern. Polaris is actually 6 stars and is located 1 degree next to the northern celestial pole. This is an accident of time and place (time cuz the axis of Earth rotates). In ~14,000 years, Vega will be near the NCP.Chapter 13: Eclipses and Sun watchingColumbus story with the lunar eclipse which saved him. Chinese legend about astronomers who were killed for fetting drunk and not reporting the eclipse to the Emperor.Superstitious beliefs about eclipses, e.g. doom and blindness [reminds me of my childhood.]Using protection filters is adviced.Complete eclipses will disappear in future as the moon escapes 4 cm from orbit around Earth every year which means its disc size is becoming smaller. These not full eclipses which happen sometimes now when the moon is far in its elipse are known as annular eclipses.Galileo didn't go blind due to looking at Sun via telescope. He invented a way to observe it indirectly. He went blind in his 70s due to cataracts and glucoma.Chapter 14: The Disaster that wasn't - The great planetary alignment of 2000On May, 5th 2000, the Earth was not destoryed [lol]. Apocalypse prophecy.Astrology. The folly of human mature, blaming the sky for what happens to us.Was not a full alignment and many more proper alignments happened in the past.Frauds publish books such as The Jupiter Effect which became best sellers.Chapter 15: Meteores, Meteoroids and Meteorites.The name of the rock is Meteoroid wethen in space or in Earth atmosphere. The glow is know as Meteore when in atmosphere and when it hits the ground it is known as Meteorite.Comets are made of frozen material and melts when passing near Sun.The Meteores hear when entering atmosphere not due to friction, but due to air compression beneath them which heats it up. Friction is actually minimal.Large meteores (100+ meters) are dangerous. How to divrer a large meteore. Best way is to improve science. Then we might be able to make these meteores from a danger inti a treasure by putting then in a safe orbit and mining the pure ores there.Chapter 16: Misunderstanding the beginning of universeHumanity thought the Gods cared about them and that they were the center of creation.The desmise of the ideas which say Earth is in the center of universe, then the idea that thw Sun is the center. Then we relized there is no center point in the universe. Discovered millions of other galaxies. We are only one of many galaxies.Hubble and the expanding universe. Birth of the Big Bang. The story of the cosmological constant. General relativity: Gravity of warping of space. Possible shapesgeometry of space. Flat land analogy.Asked what is before the Big Bang is just like asking what is north of north pole [this assumes the Big Bang is the beginning of time which we don't know for sure, maybe the unive is cyclic and eternal].Big bang is the expansion of space itself, not an expansion into anything else.Part 4: Artificial intelligenceScience is built on evidence. Experiments that can be repeated and replicated. Pseudoscience is different from science. We must use rationality to expose and defeat itChapter 17: Appalled at ApolloThe Moon Landing Hoax. Reply to their main points.1. Jet black sky wth no stars due to camera short exposure time. Air doesn't absorb star light!2. Surviving the radiation of space. Particles from Sun solar wind trapped in Earth's magnetic field. The radiation zone is known as Van Allen belt. They are 2 belts, an inner small intense one and a larger outer one that is less intense. Beyond this there is not risky radiation except the occasional solar flares (unpredictable).Solar flares are dangerous. And this was a risk.3. Dusty Moon surface. mili meters to centi meters in depth only. Too low pressure by the landing vehicle to cause a crater. There is no air on Moon, that's why dust wasn't blown away (no air to carry it like what happens on Earth).4. Temperature of lunar surface. Landings were made during day. The heat only reaches high temperatures after a while (the moon day is a month long, 2 weeks sun and 2 weeks dark). When the Sun is low (i.e. morning) the temperature is not that bad. They timed their landings at this time. [Seems NASA planned the landings really well].Astronauts needed air conditioning in their suits in order to get rid of their internal body heat and not for protection against external heat.Moon dust is a very bad conductor; the rocks beneath it are really cold. In shadow everything becomes really cold very fast. The real problem with many parts was cold and not heat.5. Tricks of light and shadows.The shadows are not completely black due to several reasons, including light reflected from Moon (back scattering), the astronauts suits and the Halo effect.Why didn't USSR deny USA went to Moon if it were hoax? They were locked in Cold War.Chapter 18: Worlds in Collision, Velikovskyvs modern sciencePsychoanalyst Immanuel Velikovsky authored Worlds in Collision. A bestseller. Supposes that Venus was separated from Jupiter (ejected from it) and flew near Earth and caused many disasters. This is to fit the myths tales about the alleged disasters.Scientifically rubbish. Shows why this is unlikely, in fact impossible to have occurred. He could have just said God did it instead of justifying his beliefs peuso-scientifically.Carl Sagan could have done better in their debate and the subsequent book.The improper hypersensitive reaction by scientists made Velikovsky into a sort of martyr. His books are still sold today.Chapter 19: In beginning, creationism and astronomy[Claims young earth creationists (YECs) are a minority. Well, they are many!]Tells us about YECs beliefs. Refutes their rubbish. Author is careful to avoid being seen as against religion; he's only against distortion of science to serve religion.Arguments about the rotation of planets, angular momentum of the Sun and super novae. Explains much science while showing how wrong and perhaps disingenuous creationists are.Chaptet 20: UFOsPsychological analysis of humans nature tendency to see UFOs.Mistaking Venus (3rd most bright object in sky after Sun and Moon) for a UFO, especially that it can appear to be following you and changing colors.Chapter 21: Why astrology doesn't work55% of American teenagers believe it. No evidence to support it. It's like a religion, resisting counter evidence. Mumbo Jumbo.How to account for the new planets and exoplanets? Psychological factors. Fague wording.Part 5: beat me upChapter 22: Hubble space telescope misconceptionsMirrors not lenses.Applying for time on Hubble.Chapter 23: star naming for dummiesISR company selling star names, misleading customers into thinking this is an official naming process.Chapter 24: Bad Astronomy goes Holywood, The top 10[Finally lol]1. Sound doesn't propagate through space2. Asteroid belt is mostly a vacuum3. Banking(i.e. turning) wings to sides does nothing as there is no air4. Laser beams travel at speed of light so that cannot be avoided. In addition there is nothing to scatter the beam therefore you won't see it (until it hits you).5. Getting measurements wrong6. Water is plentiful in universe, no one will come all the way to Earth to steal it!7. Gravity is always around and never goes away. You can't escape the gravity of Earth.8. Stars are really far. Distances are huge. You can't just pass them one after the other like that [even when going at speed of light].9. Explosions in space are different because there is no air10. Moon phases misunderstood. For example, you can't see full moon with the Sun behind it.Good Astronomy movies: 2001 A space odyssey.Even bad astronomy can motivate people to read about real science and maybe study it.Author style is interesting and explains ideas with stories. Author has clearly read a lot of literature (e.g. he quotes Charles Dickens and Mark Twain books for their use of scientific ideas) and watched a lot of movies.Corrected some misconceptions I had and added quite a bit to my knowledge.I didn't like the parts about UFOs, astrology and creationism much. Why the sky blue was much better for example; it taught me something!",2,N/A
