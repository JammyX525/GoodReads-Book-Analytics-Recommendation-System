This website proved popular, which led to this first book by Plait, that carries on from the website and in a detailed and clear fashion criticises and disproves popular myths and misconceptions relating to astronomy, and promotes science as a means of explaining the skies. The work describes 24 common astronomical fallacies, including the beliefs that the Coriolis effect determines the direction that water drains in a bathtub, and that planetary alignments can cause disaster on Earth. The author sharply and convincingly dismisses astrology, creationism, and UFO sightings, and explains the principles behind basic general concepts (the Big Bang, why the sky is blue, etc.).","Philip Cary Plait, Ph.D. (aka ""The Bad Astronomer"") is a US astronomer, skeptic, writer and popular science blogger. He is a well known author and public figure in the fields of astronomy and science. Plait gained his Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Virginia in 1994. He began his career with the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. His first foray into public life was with his blog that described ""bad astronomy"" in movies and in public perception in general. This led to Plait's first book Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Astrology to the Moon Landing ""Hoax"" (2002). In 2008, he became President of the James Randi Educational Foundation, serving in that position until January 1, 2010.Dr Phil Plait remains a popular and well known figure popularising science and astronomy.",9,224,262,5662,"['2167 (38%)', '2039 (36%)', '1080 (19%)', '255 (4%)', '121 (2%)']"
