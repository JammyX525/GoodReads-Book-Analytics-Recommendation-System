420739,After the Night,Blacky *Romance Addict*,464,6201,5,"March 25, 2015","This book has the best asshole/jerk hero EVER!OMG I loved every damn scene when he was horrible to her <3 I wanted him to be worse!!! I couldn't wait for it!He is just that good! Or maybe I am that wrong bwahahhahahahhahahahhBut seriously, he is one of the best jerks I've read <3 I want to read more of those now <3The storyI don’t know why you’re here, and it doesn’t matter. This motel belongs to me. You aren’t welcome. You have half an hour to get packed and get out."" He gave her a wolfish smile that wasn’t really a smile. ""Or do I have to call the sheriff again to get rid of you?""It starts off in the past, showing Faith Devlin's life in childhood and teen years.You'll be happy to know it only lasts 5 chapters (YAY!!!)Her family is pretty much horrible, as everyone in town calls them, trash.She is the only sensible among them, taking care of her little brother and basically the whole family.One night changes everything, both for her and for Gray, a guy she's had a crush on for forever.Her mother runs away with his father.Yep, you can imagine how that turns out, and that is what causes the endless hate between the Rouillards and the Devlins.Twelve years after the incident, Faith returns to her hometown, only to find Gray trying to throw her out of it again.Bad for him, she won't back down :DDDThe romance
  
    ""You haven’t listened to my… suggestions yet.""""I don’t intend to, either. Go back to your table and leave me alone.""""I’d planned on doing the first."" He stood and trailed a long forefinger down her cheek. ""There’s no way in hell I’ll do the last.""
  
The sexual attraction is through the roof here! The romance isn't sweet, they fight constantly, but the dialogue, everything between them... Uber chemistry!For one, I loved how they were trying to outsmart each other throughout the book. He wanted her out of town, she wanted to stay.It was basically war :DAnd in the middle of it, they were fighting the huge attraction, well, poor them because it didn't really work :)What I loved best because even though Gray was pretty much a jerk to her all the time, he was also very protective. Yes, I know that sounds weird but if you read it you will understand. I loved him even more because of that :))))Overall
  
    Danger glittered in those dark eyes, and before she knew it, he was right in front of her again, almost playfully pinching her chin. ""You’re a ballsy little babe, aren’t you? Maybe too ballsy for your own good. Don’t take me on in a fight, sweet thing, because you’ll get hurt.""
  
My only objection here was the mystery.Really predictable and not done so well. BUT!Gray more than made up for it.I can't tell you how much I loved this, one of the best books I've ever read!!!!If you like jerkish heroes, people, READ THIS NOW!!!!!I can't recommend it enough!*buddy read with Glam <3*",237,87
420739,After the Night,EmBibliophile,461,1011,4,"January 14, 2022","I honestly don’t know what made me love this book that much. I guess just did.It started with the hero throwing the heroine’s family out of their house and him calling the heroine a “trash”“You’re trash,” he said in a deep, harsh voice as the girl drew even with him. She halted, frozen to the spot,Then her coming back to her hometown years later to unravel what truly happened years ago determined to prove that she’s not the trash everyone thinks she is. I just loved how determined she was and how she made something for herself despite how her family was.Then all the sexual tension, the angst, and the struggle the hero have between trying to make her leave the town to protect his family and wanting to have her. This is such an addicting haters to lovers story that was just so good! I loved the characters, the suspense even if it was all so obvious, the plot, the romance, and just everything. I can see myself binge reading more of the author’s books!",93,16
420739,After the Night,♥Sharon♥,949,143,5,"September 21, 2015","I thoroughly enjoyed this book and if you are a Linda Howard fan and have yet to read it you better make sure you do. This one was different than Cry No More (the only other LH book I’ve read) which was great because I am very curious about the different storylines she writes. In After the Night we get two very different main characters whose past and future are intertwined with hatred, lust, sadness and long awaited happiness. Faith Devlin’s didn’t have much in her life. She knew she had nothing of value whether it was the house she lived in or the clothes on her back. Her mother was nothing but a whore and her father was a drunk. But Faith knew she wasn’t trash like the rest of them. She dreamed of finding a way for her and her little brother Scottie to get out of the dirty world they lived in. Little did she know it would be at the hands of the man that she dreamed about. The one she had come to love.
  
Grayson Rouillard ~  What a bastard he was. I hated the fact that I liked him, that I found him sexy and alluring. He was tall, dark and handsome. Had hair that reached the nape of his neck. His words and actions towards Faith were hateful but I had a sense that his anger toward her was misplaced. It has been 12 years since he drove Faith away. But Gray has never able to forget her. He was never able to let go of that desire he felt for her. 
  
Faith Devlin ~No one expected her to amount to much. She had been a fragile little girl within a family that everyone considered trash. But Faith was strong and knew differently. Life had thrown that final blow 12 years earlier, a blow that only strengthened her resolve to prove everyone wrong. She wasn’t looking for redemption. She just wanted to go home. Returning home would mean searching for answers to questions from her past and it also meant facing the one man that she has loved for as long as she can remember. Would she be strong enough to stand up to him and the people who rejected her? 
  
When Faith returns home to try and get answers to what happened so many years ago she is met with expected resistance and hostility. As she inches towards getting answers to things that happened that summer she is lead back to the Rouillard’s lake house. A place that brought back heated memories from the past and a place where more heated memories would be made. But someone was going to do whatever was needed to make sure Faith never got her answers. There was too much as risk and Faith needed to be stopped.
  
When Gray and Faith could no longer resist each other, things get pretty intense between them. The sex scenes were written with such raw sensuality and were off the charts HOT. I have to say the sexual build up left you with no other choice but to FEEL everything within those scenes. Gray had to possess Faith in such a way that was dangerous yet necessary to his being. Faith had no choice but to surrender.
  
This was such an amazing story and I loved every minute of it. Though certain things were a little predictable it didn’t bother me one bit. There was enough swirling around in the plot that kept me engaged and intrigued. Both Gray and Faith were wonderful characters but I give a little more love to Faith. She was that flower that would grow no matter what. 
  
Another highly recommended read!!",88,73

420739,After the Night,Anna (Bobs Her Hair),907,193,1,"January 21, 2011","I love Linda Howard! So when I kept hearing about After the Night I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Well, I did. It was horrible!!! The hero is abusive and the heroine is a doormat who makes excuses for his ill treatment of her. It's not fair to blame someone, treat them poorly, and encourage the whole town to treat them poorly because of the sins of the parent. This is one very unhealthy ""romance."" An After the Night reviewer stated that if this was your best friend you would encourage her to leave the abusive jerk. I agree. After the Night now sits in some used bookstore waiting for the next person who will love it or hate it.",64,10

    FAITH DEVLIN: A poor, outcast child in Prescott, Louisiana, she'd always adored the town's golden boy from afar. But he called her white trash that sultry Southern night when his rich, respected father disappeared, along with her pretty Mom.
  

  It was a good day for dreaming. It was late in the afternoon, the sun throwing long shadows when it could manage to break through the thick woods, but for the most part the translucent golden light was tangled in the tops of the trees, leaving the forest floor mysteriously shadowed.
I mean if an opening sentence like that doesn’t draw you in …This was a re-read for me. I was stranded in the West of Ireland with no WiFi over the weekend and decided to do a couple of re-reads. Fantastic book. The first time I read it I really thought Gray was a complete and utter bastard. He did not come across as such this time around, for some reason. Still a bit of a prick but you gotta love him.
  Do you know why men name their cocks?""""No, why?"" she asked, trying to stifle her laughter.""So most of the major decisions in their lives won’t be made by a total stranger.”
There is mystery, suspense, sadness, happiness, hot sex. What more could one ask for?
  “It was amazing how flowers could grow in the damnedest places, but the Devlin weed patch had sprouted quite a wildflower in Faith.” 

  “It was just a kiss – ""
I loved how strong Faith was after the childhood she had. She dusted herself off and held her head high and faced the people from her past.
  He was fully aroused, his erection as hard as marble, straining against her ….

420739,After the Night,♥Rachel♥,"1,800",828,5,"January 3, 2016","After the Night was my first Linda Howard book, and I absolutely LOVED it! It’s a riveting read, with a stormy and sizzling romance! Faith Devlin has come back to Prescott, Louisiana after twelve years away. She was cruelly thrown out of her home at the young age of fourteen. Though it was no fault of hers, Faith suffered the disgrace her mother, Renee, had brought down on them. Being regarded as white trash and suffering the stain her mother’s reputation made Faith determined to never be like any of her family so she made something of herself, but has never truly been able to move past the jarring events of the past: At the age of fourteen she had literally been thrown out into the night like a piece of trash, and she had lived with that pain ever since. Where is her mother and her mother’s lover, and why did they leave never to be heard from again? Their actions left two families very nearly destroyed, and Faith is back to find out some answers and closure. However, bringing up the past doesn’t sit well and soon Faith is facing threats and danger that may silence her forever. Faith fell in love with Gray Rouillard, the admired son of the most powerful and wealthy family in Prescott, from afar when she was just a little girl. Unfortunately, the years have done little to diminish her attraction, but if Gray Rouillard thinks he can bully her out of town again, he’s got another thing coming! Faith is no longer a little helpless girl, and I loved her determination. Even in the face of her blinding attraction to Gray, she didn’t let him distract her from her goals. I adored Faith! She was a woman who came from nothing with zero advantages and still managed to have a strong, positive spirit without being overcome by bitterness over the past. The cruel way in which Faith was treated because of the action of others angered me so much! At first I hated Gray! His actions tore Faith’s life apart in such a humiliating way I wanted to kick him in the teeth! But after getting some of his perspective I eased up on my feelings. Be patient with Gray and you’ll fall for him every bit as much as I did! Gray can’t help the attraction he feels for Faith. At the age of fourteen she possessed unmatched beauty; as a grown woman she’s gorgeous, but she’s the image of her mother and reminds Gray of the pain heaped on his family. Still, he can’t help himself; can’t stop pursuing her to the point of obsession. Even though I wanted Gray and Faith together, I was happy she didn’t just fall for him or let her guard down even though she was wildly attracted to him. I love a smart heroine! Faith kept her goals in place, and her resolve meant that Gray had work to prove himself, to gain her trust. Their romance was hot, lusty, and tumultuous, and I loved every battle they fought! Linda Howard wrote an epic, captivating story, and soon after finishing After the Night, which by the way, was published over sixteen years ago (!!), I went through her backlog of titles and added several to my TBR. I highly recommend her addictive writing!As a side note, I bought the Kindle/e-Copy version and then added the audio version for an extra $3.49. It was totally worth it because Natalie Ross' narration is excellent!! If you're cramped for reading time like I am this is an excellent way to read a book by switching back and forth between e-copy to audio. I listen on my commute back and forth to work, when I'm getting ready and when I cook dinner.",45,13
420739,After the Night,Didi,865,290,5,"January 13, 2014","~~~~ 5++++++ FANTASTIC STARS ~~~~I've never read Linda Howard till now....and I'm rectifying that poor judgement on my part. Aside from the fact that I had never heard of her until recently, well, I've rectified that too. This book was GOLD.I loved this and every second spent reading it. This book has been around for a while and so many people have read it, so I'll skip any type of synopsis. The plot was great, the suspense built up beautifully. I did suspect the culprit early on, but the reasons for why stumped me. The characters were incredibly well developed. They were infused with the perfect blend of good and bad, right and wrong. They were fleshed out thoroughly, their actions making sense with who they were.I loved Faith from the start. Growing up poor and being called trash all based on the actions of your family and not you, is tragic. Being removed from your home and being made to feel like an animal is heartbreaking. What I loved about her so much was the degree of empathy and understanding regarding her circumstances and those responsible for them. She empathized with Gray and despite his severe assholish tendencies, she gave him the benefit of the doubt. It took some major backbone to walk back into Prescott resembling the woman that brought the town to its knees. It took even bigger character to face off with the man that haunted her dreams and resided in her fears. But Faith Devlin did it with style. Gray was such an interesting character. His hurt and contempt towards Faith was often ill directed, but he came to see that your family doesn't decide who you are, but your actions do. He wanted Faith from the start. He couldn't understand the dichotomy between his mind and need, but that didn't stop him from trying! He was incredible to read about, sounded sexy as sin.The sexual tension was off the charts. The best way to describe the sexy time in this book: RAW SENSUALITY. It came off the pages like dust. Magic, entrancing dust. I think LH writes smexy time brilliantly. The scenes are so thick with sensuality and power. I loved it and think we need to read more of that than the formulaic sex scenes of late. The ending was perfect and really brought everything full circle. I wish there was an epilogue though, not to say it didn't end well, it ended amazingly! But I wanted to see how people treated Faith after everything she did, I wanted to see her life with Gray, that sexy pirate-like beast of a man. He was truly bigger than the pages given to write about him. I am planning to read much more of LH now and hope her other work makes me feel as good as this book after reading it. LOVED IT.",42,50
420739,After the Night,Ingie,"1,323",169,5,"December 13, 2014","Written December 12, 20144.7 Stars - Stunning great - a heartwrencherAt last I started Linda Howard's good ""oldie"". I'd both the 12 hrs audiobook (narrated by Natalie Ross) in my ears and sometimes also the ebook in my other hand.     OMG, this will be IS so very good! I was in a kind of dreamy 'book-love' in this romance already after a feew chapter... or minutes really. Completely enchanted and my tears was flowing. A keeper, an unforgettable epic romance story to remember. Simply GRAND!! ***********************************************************Prescott, LouisianaAfter the Night is the heartbreaking and stunning love-story about Faith Devlin the former mocked ""white trash"" girl and the 'larger-than-life' hero, Gray Rouillard, once the towns very lucky happy rich-mans boy. After the Night is also the story about the truth about that (by then 12 years old) devastating scandal surrounding Faith's mother and Gray's father elopement and shameless sex-affair. “Your whole family is trash. Your mother is a whore and your father is a thieving drunk. Get out of this parish and don’t ever come back.”That awful night, when she was 14 and he 22. The night that so mercilessly changed both their lives. One horrible night no one can ever forget! The hate, anger, and roughness of the gritty degradation is impossible to wash off....Or is it possible. What was the truth, what was the rumor, what really happened?
  
    
  
***********************************************************It makes no sense and does no difference that I write a thousand positive adjectives about this amazing 20 years old Howard romance. Most of you have probably already read it anyway. But a few short words...My only tiny whining is perhaps that this narrator made our hero's voice slightly dorky and that the passage of time (since it was written 1995) sometimes is noticeable. Otherwise a fantastic good ""from childishly sweet swarming love to adult mature heat need"" Romance.Best, for me, was (of course..) the first half.. The stunning first part that told the story of their childhood and the tentative teenage years. The first love, the first connection.OMG (again..) it was so d@mn hertbreaking emotional. There, in the beginning had After the Night really true classic 'grand sob novel' status. ~ That little innocent baby brother!! Sob &Sigh!!! My heart broke... ‘For a little while, he had been happy. That first Christmas after **** left had made him delirious with joy. He had sat for hours, too tired to play but content to stare at the twinkling lights on the Christmas tree.’The terrible shame, the for them all so ugly humiliation, the social injustice for these kids and all those emotions. My tear channels opened completely... — I didn't know who I wanted to yell most at.
“.... Men are different from women; the more excited we are, the more like cavemen we sound. I could barely speak English with you, much less French. As I remember, my vocabulary deteriorated to a few short, explicit words, ‘fuck’ being the most prominent.”The second half was more of an ordinary steamy suspence romance. Still captivating interesting and a very good reading (listening). ~ Highly recommended!! Thank you dear Irina, who nudged me that this book is an absolute must-read CR. You are so right, sweetie.***********************************************************I LIKE - bull's-eye for a romantics who like to sob...",39,53
420739,After the Night,Crazy About Love ❤️,220,45,5,"August 21, 2022","⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ five stars -* new rating as of 8/2022New upgraded rating because I just can’t stop thinking about this book! I think I loved it enough to add this to my “all time faves” shelf. I just read it for the first time about a month ago, and I’ve already reread it about twice now lol. This book hits all my top scoring points:. Childhood connection ✔️. Enemies to lovers ✔️. A Hero that’s manly, yet still sensitive in private - *swoon ✔️. Storyline that spans over a long period of time - in this case, from our heroine’s childhood ✔️. Enough action to keep me vested in our h’s best interests ✔️. Intelligent fmc that has a successful career ✔️This is one of the better books I’ve read in quite some time. I enjoyed myself, I loved the romance, and I loved the fact that it’s romantic suspense without it being graphically descriptive of the murder that’s happened as part of the plot line.In short, this book has snuck up on me as a favorite. It’s quietly wormed its way into my little book-loving heart ♥️, and has taken up residence there in pride of place on my favorites shelf.Highly recommend to anyone looking for an adult romantic read that enjoys a touch of suspense. Five stars - the kind that shine brightly through the clouds ⛅️.* original review to follow……….Whew! I finally found a great read this month 😂 “finally!”, is all I can say 💁‍♀️.I thoroughly enjoyed this trip back in time, and nearly wholeheartedly enjoyed this book! The romance here was very sweet - childhood crush grows into love - I just eat that trope right up!What a wonderful time capsule this book is! I really enjoyed that part of the story, which is humorous as it’s not meant to be that, as it was published as a modern romance. Given the fact that this was originally published back in 1995, there were so many actions that made me reminisce about life before smartphones. I just adored these parts of the story and jumped in my favorite chair with glee each time our heroine utilized items that are nearly extinct. For example: microfiche! Yes, microfiche. What a fun word we don’t get to use in everyday conversation anymore 🥲 makes me sniffle for the good old days.I particularly enjoyed it when our heroine had to get directions to someone’s house and: went to a brick and mortar library, consulted a living, breathing human - aka the “librarian”, pulled out a map of the town - most likely a platt survey! Yes, an actual platt survey!, folded said map/platt survey back up to return, then had to drive by HER MEMORY to the destination! Yes, this is truly the actions that excited me. Millennials may fail to comprehend my glee with these actions taken by our heroine to suss out her destination, but I JUST LOVED IT!Given the fact that this story was not meant to be taken as a time period romance 😂 and was written as a modern contemporary “thriller” romance, these aspects of the story were told merely to showcase our heroine’s sleuthing capabilities. This story by Howard is meant to be an action romance, after all, and most of the actions do stand up to the test of time, and did make my heart pound. I did fear for our heroine’s safety in moments of written suspenseful action! I did feel angst due to a perilous situation our Hero and heroine find ourselves in! I booed the villain! Given the fact that Howard is an older, longtime writer who first began publishing in the 1980’s, I’m going to assume that I’ve most likely previously read novels by her at some point in my life, and am sure I’ll come across one at some point as I’ve decided that her writing style (romance suspenseful thrillers) are just what I need right now to get me out of my book slump.Howard has a new fan and a new follow. Highly recommend to anyone who’s of a certain age that would love to be able to pull the word, “microfiche”, out of their hat again lol.Four shining stars. I just loved this nostalgic, romantic stroll…",38,1 comment
420739,After the Night,Birjis,431,303,4,"August 26, 2020","*Re-read: 23th Aug, 2020*This is another mind-riveting read by Linda Howard I enjoyed. I came across this book when I was searching to read books with cruel heroes, the hero here was cruel at one point not throughout. I like heroes who are cruel at intervals and caring in their twisted way. It wasn't as much as I expected but I got involved with the story and the main characters were amazing. This book has mystery, tragedy and romance.Faith Devlin (26), was a sweet and caring girl born to a drunk father and a whore of a mother. Fourth among five children it seemed she was the only responsible person in the family. Always a wanderer person she wished to take away her little brother who is ill and retarded, and to be someone of success instead of the labelled ""trashy Devlins"". When one night thrown away like a trash by the man she loved changes her life drastically.Grayson Rouillard (34), was an alluring and mean a-hole. Rich, tall and handsome he was the man of every girls dreams. Gray's father was also a playboy but he loved his children. Gray's mother was a woman who prefers to stay alone and vehemently hates anyone touching her. It's a wonder she birthed two children. Gray was devastated and felt betrayed when his father left the town and the reason led to the Devlins.Now 12 years later Faith is back in town very different from the way she left. She is back for answers of the past. Unfortunately, the cruel treatment done to her by Gray didn't diminish the feelings she had for him. Even if he tries to chase her out of town again she is determined to finish what she came here to do. Faith and Gray's attraction is sizzling, Gray keeps pursuing her and is helpless to his lusty thoughts. I love their fights, how stubborn Faith is and the authors description of Gray. There is a little tragey, an unrequinted love and betrayal. Gray's mother is a top notch bitch, to me she is worse than Faith's mother. In a way Gray, Faith and Gray's father suffered because of her. The crimes are also done in her favour, when she didn't even participate in any human business. This book is a crime/thriller story with a nice plot.",38,10

Fighting with her was more exhilarating than making love to other women.""I'm in love with Gray and Faith.❤ I absolutely loved their banter and their enemies-to-lovers story. There is a mystery that connects them to their ugly past. It was easy to guess who the culprit was, but the romance is the most enjoyable aspect of this amazing book. 💕 my first book by this author and definitely won't be the last. ""You’re trash,"" he said in a deep, harsh voice as the girl drew even with him. She halted, frozen to the spot.""""I told you to be out by nightfall, and I meant it,"" Gray snapped. ""Gather up what you want to take with you, because in half an hour I’m setting fire to whatever is left.""Faith was such a strong and amazing heroine, my favorite type when dealing with a hero who hates her. She wasn't weak even when her own family and the whole town wanted to bring her down. And it was this strength that attracted the most powerful man to her.""There was only one man whom she could love completely, heart and soul and body, nothing held back, and that was Gray Rouillard...And he was the one man to whom she didn’t dare give herself, because he would destroy her.""She never forgot his words...""you're trash""Honestly, it was one of the best hate-turn-to love story I've read. The hero was a strong, powerful man, who hated her, yet was so confused by his emotions and attraction to her. Gray was caring and protective of those he loved. Even though he knew he should hate Faith, he always felt a magnetic attraction to her, which made him see her in a light that is far from all the hatred and anger he felt. ""What he’d just had with Faith was as powerful and unstoppable as an avalanche, a fire that left him scorched and already needing to feel the flame again.He himself wanted her with a fierce need that both alarmed and disgusted him""""He had always loved the way women smelled, but Faith’s scent was so enticing that every muscle in his body tightened with need, making it difficult for him to think of anything else.""I highly recommend it 💕",37,11
