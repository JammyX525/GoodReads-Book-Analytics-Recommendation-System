32527,Alone,MarilynW,"1,032",2562,4,"March 11, 2021","Alone  (Detective D.D. Warren #1) by Lisa Gardner (Author), Anna Fields (Narrator)My friend DeAnn suggested that we buddy read the eleven book Detective D.D. Warren series together and I'm glad that she did. But I can't promise that I'm not going to laugh at D.D. Warren every single time she shows up for work in her stilettos. If I were her partner, I think I'd have reservations about working with someone who could break an ankle on the job, due to footwear choices. Despite this being labeled as a D.D. Warren book, she doesn't show up until about the halfway point and even then she's in the background, for the most part. This book belongs to Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge, who kills his first man ever when he has to use his sniper skills to kill a man who is threatening his wife and son with a gun. That one shot is going to be the ruin of Bobby's life as the man's father, a judge, is going to destroy Bobby for killing his son, unless Bobby lies and blames the wife, Catherine, for setting up her husband. The wife was the twelve year old victim of a kidnapper/pedophile decades ago and now that horrible man is out of prison and has some deadly jobs to do in return for this early release. This story is fast and it's impossible to know if Catherine is just a victim or deeply involved in manipulating circumstances to meet her needs. The judge and his wife are highly suspect and all we can know is that a four year old boy is suffering greatly because of the failings of the adults in his life. I look forward to the second book in this series. Published January 11th 2005",185,37
32527,Alone,Suz,"1,045",533,5,"May 5, 2015","Tremendous! This is the series to read if you want to breeze through a book and be thoroughly engrossed. Did not want to put this down for one moment, and am very glad I discovered Lisa Gardner, much like my discovery of Harlan Coben. I started reading this series at number 3, and thought this was why I didn't feel a close affinity to Detective D.D Warren, but I think on reading this book, I have realised she must not be the focus of the series. The character of Police sniper Bobby is very likable, I really felt I knew where he was coming from, and his plight had me from the first page. I look forward to reading about Bobby again straight away, and will be doing so momentarily as I just picked up my copy of number two. I was on the hunt for the next book even before finishing this one, and it's not a common feel for this reader to go out and get the next installment immediately.. He's smart, straight forward, and oh so flawed. He's someone I want to get to the bottom of, his complexities are very appealing. There are many layers here where the author expertly peels away for us in an unobtrusive and expert way. This particular story line had many many bends in the road, and I was on a constant ride of emotion, and enjoyed a few back flips along the way. I'm sure most of you out there are aware of this author, but I'm just so happy I didn't miss her completely.",81,15
32527,Alone,jv poore,606,196,3,"July 1, 2021","Not that my expectations were set, but I had the second Detective D.D. Warren book on hand to start as soon as I finished this one. So far, so very good. ",62,3
32527,Alone,Jonetta,"2,164",879,4,"November 25, 2019","Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge is called to a tense domestic disturbance standoff. He’s the trained sniper on the team and has the husband, James Gagnon, in his sights. Gagnon has a gun to his wife Catherine’s head and their young son is in the room. When Gagnon makes a threatening move, Bobby takes the shot that ends the standoff and Gagnon’s life. What was an on-the-job action becomes a nightmare for him when Gagnon’s powerful father, a judge, files criminal charges against Bobby. This turned out to be an incredibly thoughtful story as it goes beyond solving a crime. While Catherine Gagnon comes under scrutiny as a potential instigator in her husband’s death, Bobby’s struggle to come to terms with his ending a man’s life based on a judgment call was fascinating. I’ve often wondered how sanctioned snipers dealt with the job and this story provides deep insights. There are many other angles to the situation, including Catherine’s tragic history as the man responsible for it is suddenly paroled and she becomes a target. The clues are all there but the resolutions still surprised me in the end. Also, D. D. Warren appears about midway through the story so be advised that her focus in the series really begins beyond this book. Bobby is the primary narrator and I really liked and admired him, flaws and all. I listened to the story and while Anna Fields is a skilled narrator, it would have been a stronger performance with a male narrator. She’s a wonderful storyteller but her voice for Bobby wasn’t the best. However, I really enjoyed this opener and am excited about continuing the series. ",56,9
32527,Alone,Patcee ,296,108,4,"July 31, 2022","Although Alone is the first in Detective DD Warren’s series, her character debut is given minimal exposure, making this, for the most part, Catherine’s lifelong survival story. A messed up childhood sets the tone and sniper Bobby Dodge are two factors that could be enough to get you interested. Catherine is intriguing, with tragedy written all over her. As a youngster, an evil paedophile grabbed her and kept her confined underground during a month-long nightmare of abuse. Unbelievably, she was found at random and rescued. Twenty-five years later, Catherine is a beautiful wife and mother scarred by the abduction and afflicted with a persistent fear of the dark. Her son has gone through a series of unexplained illnesses which have put the boy in hospital. Sensing something very wrong, that her husband has a gun and is intending to kill the family, Catherine calls Bobby, a trained sniper. In a split second, to save woman and child, he shoots the husband. She is also now widowed. How much can a woman take? To make matters worse, her powerful father-in-law, Judge Gagnon, holds Catherine responsible for his son’s death and the boy’s bad health. Are these random incidents? Could there be a mastermind? If so, who?Lisa Gardner is a gutsy author, having writing skills that hide behind her natural prose and realistic, everyday dialogue. The clever overall story arc unfolds as a brisk page-turner, on a steady pace even as many sly, lesser characters interrupted to plot their own dodgy actions. She bring on twists and turns and pulls out a grand finale.The particular emphasis in this novel may be a disturbing domestic thriller, but it is also a story of survival, parent/child interaction and a rare take on Munchausen by proxy and Fanconi-Bickel syndromes. It is a fascinating look into ‘the sniper’ and the law, killing when not an act of war, approval of man as weapon in the policing toolbox. What of a sniper’s psyche, mental health or PTSD, on call to kill 24/7? There’s something to think about.",43,11
32527,Alone,Mo,"1,348",2,3,"October 6, 2015","3.5 stars.While I enjoyed this one and it kept me on my toes, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. I wasn't really connected to any of the characters. Even the main male character, Bobby, had his shortcomings. It's an introduction of D.D. Warren and future books and even she didn't enthral me.It is set in Boston, a city I love. Sex scenes? Forget it. I think that might have been part of my problem. I love a bit of romance in my RS books. It doesn't even have to be explicit sex scenes, just a little romance. Sorry I cannot be more flattering about the book. Will I read some more of the series? I probably will. Writing was excellent. Plot was good and some twists and turns I didn't see coming. ",36,24
32527,Alone,"Erin (from Long Island, NY)",433,144,5,"January 15, 2021","Holy crap, that was a ride! I’m so excited that this is the beginning of a series.. Although I am a little concerned that it’s the D.D. Warren series (& not the Bobby Dodge series!♥️) But honestly this was so good- I have faith! It’s been a while since a book caught me like this 1 did. The different aspects of the story, the clues & “reveals,” the crazy intense characters.. I couldn’t put it down!",31,2
32527,Alone,Jane Stewart,"2,462",831,2,"March 19, 2012","I did not enjoy the characters, the plot, or the narrator. I wanted it to be over.Gunshots are heard. Neighbors call the police who surround the house. Inside Jimmy is pointing a gun at his wife Catherine. Bobby is a sniper and member of the police SWAT team. He sees Jimmy’s face change, and he believes Jimmy will shoot, so Bobby shoots and kills Jimmy. Now Jimmy’s father James is suing Bobby. If James wins Bobby goes to jail. If James loses, he will repeatedly appeal because he is wealthy. He can afford to. The problem is that the city and union will not pay Bobby’s legal fees because James is filing suit through a clerk magistrate which is not the normal process. Bobby did what he was trained to do. If he didn’t shoot Jimmy, then he believed Jimmy would have killed Catherine. Now Bobby has to pay $5000 to a defense attorney. I was furious. Policemen should not be forced to pay their own legal feels for following orders and doing their job. I don’t know if this exists in real life, but if it does, then something is very wrong. This part of the plot made me so angry that I had a hard time enjoying the rest. This legal-issue-stress hangs over Bobby until the last few pages of the book.Was the rest of the story good? Parts of it maybe. Catherine was kidnaped and raped by Richard when she was twelve. When her only child Nathan was born, Catherine had some mental problems and did not appear to be a good mother. The child has been raised by nannies. Nathan is frequently sick and the doctors don’t know why. Some fear it is Münchausen syndrome by proxy, which means the mother is purposely doing things to make the child sick to get attention for herself. For most of the book, the reader wonders if Catherine is good or bad for her son. James is also suing Catherine for custody of Nathan.Richard has been in jail for twenty-five years. James uses his influence to get Richard released on parole. Someone is now paying Richard to murder people connected to Catherine or the case.I did not enjoy the characters. I felt anxiety and depression rather than sympathy. I didn’t feel fun anticipation rooting for someone. We don’t know if Catherine is good or bad, but she’s not likeable. James and Richard are too one-dimensional, powerful, and evil. Bobby spends too much time suffering and second guessing himself, wondering if he did the right thing. He was having problems with the concept of killing someone. He talks to a psychiatrist several times about this as well as troubles from his early life. Some of this was ok, but it seemed a bit much. He also did some illogical and stupid things which made him less sympathetic. Regarding the plot, I had questions unanswered at the end. But maybe part of those were necessary. I understand Catherine has some kind of role in the sequel “Hide” which I have not read.NARRATOR:I did not like the narrator Anna Fields. The voice she used for Bobby and some of the men was so deep that it sounded like a mentally slow person who is groggy and slurring his words. Some of her general third party narration was too sharp and hurried, almost like she was reading a report and not thinking about what she was reading. When talking about a sniper she said “he breathed in, he breathed out.” That phrase should have been read slowly and calmly, yet the narrator’s voice was sharp, staccato, and fast.DATA:Unabridged audiobook reading time: 10 hrs and 12 mins. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words. Sexual content: some references to sexual activity but no details shown. References include the rape of Catherine when she was 12. Setting: current day Boston, Massachusetts. Copyright: 2005. Genre: mystery suspense thriller. Ending: Good guys win.OTHER BOOKS:This is the first book in the D.D. Warren series. D.D. is a female cop. She has a small part in this book. In the sequels I believe she and Bobby work together as a team.",26,22
32527,Alone,Jean,703,20,4,"April 2, 2015","Lisa Gardner has crafted a fine psychological thriller in Alone. While I found myself immediately immersed in the drama, I got about 160 pages in, and I still wasn’t sure where she was taking me. It was that complex.Bobby Dodge is a Massachusetts State Trooper who is a sniper called in as part of a crisis team to handle a hostage situation in a wealthy Boston neighborhood. From a window across the street, he sets up his rifle. He sees a woman, a young boy, and a man with a gun. As the man’s finger tightens on the trigger and his face contorts into an evil smile, Bobby has to make an instantaneous decision. He does. Lives change forever.Catherine Gagnon, the widow of the man Bobby shot, is incredibly beautiful. She is also manipulative and dangerous. As a young girl, she was kidnapped and sexually molested. She was rescued, and her abuser was put in prison. But she carries some deep scars. The story has multiple layers, as we learn that Jimmy Gagnon, the dead man, was the son of a powerful judge, who wants to gain custody of Catherine’s young son Nathan. Judge Gagnon is having murder charges brought against Bobby unless he lies about what happened the night of the shooting. And then people begin to die.Who is behind the killings, and why? Bobby knows he should stay away from Catherine, but he also sees her as a woman who needs help. Can he really help? And can he heal the wounds of his own painful past? Did he do the right thing, or will doubts plague him the rest of his life?This novel is billed as a Detective D.D. Warren book, but we don’t meet her until midway through the book, and we actually see very little of her in this first of the series, so I didn’t feel that I got to know her. Bobby and Catherine were both well-developed characters. Messed up, but well written. Actually, there are lots of messed up people in this book. Although I was able to predict some of what happened, I did not know what motivated the characters, at least not all of them, and I liked that. There were a few minor things, editing errors, which stuck out. Also, the puppy is said to lick the child with a rough tongue. I know cats have rough tongues; dogs do not. That would have been a wet, sloppy kiss. Some of the events seemed rather unbelievable, especially the final scene in the hotel. That seemed to me like a made-for-TV scene. But for the most part, I did not want to turn off the lights and be alone while reading Alone, so I think the author did her job in writing a great thriller.I’m giving it 4 ½ stars.",26,7

  BookPage Magazine - January 2005 - Alone
This book is excellent & the flow took me by surprise when I compare it to many “police” movies & TV shows that I have seen...In movie/TV shows, when Policemen come to a crime scene, with a abusive & threatening husband cornered, holding a gun to his wife/child’s head. If not “talked“down, the police “To Serve & Protect” may have to fight and/or shoot the husband....
  
  
  
In this story, Bobby Dodge is a Massachusetts State “Sniper” Trooper, only used in drastic situations using his rifle to “scope” out situations in crimes & not shooting.In this assignment, a threatening husband has a gun to his wife/son head, cornered by policemen & not being “talked” down. When Bobby’s called in for backup, he uses his rifle to “scope” out details, but when the husband appears ready to shoot, Bobby cannot stop himself & unexpectedly shoots at the last moment to save the wife/child & 
  kills the husband
!!Bobby Dodge has “Tremendous” psychological pains with his first victim, but he really fell into a more complex crime with many questions, was the father killed really a set-up, was it for separation, child custody, kidnapping and/or money plans?Det. D.D. Warrens plays a minor role - the first book in this series.It's always nice reading a book with your home setting. Being from Boston you know how well the author knows the streets & suburbs as you do. (less)

32527,Alone,Mary,495,12,4,"March 23, 2021","I would give this book 4&1/2 stars if I could. This is a very good read that has many layers to the story. LG is good at giving the reader a few clues and a little info at a time. Just when you think the story is done she gives you one last thing. I have read many of Ms. Gardner's earlier books and enjoyed all of them. I like her flawed characters, especially the recurring ones. This book introduces D.D. Warren. I look forward to getting to know her better in future books. Bobby Dodge is a great character in this book too. I would highly recommend this book or any of LG's books!",15,N/A

32527,Alone,☮Karen,"1,449",9,3,"September 10, 2019","One of the GR groups I am in voted to read this series together starting in November. I got a headstart on this one, having never read this author before. For being first in the D. D. Warren series, her part here was very small. I really enjoyed the main character, Bobby Dodge, a state police sniper who gets called to a domestic dispute and ends up killing the husband. D. D. in my opinion was not likeable, I guess I thought she was mean to poor Bobby as he was suffering the aftershocks of his first kill. I hope that in the future books D. D. grows some compassion or a sense of humor. I will be continuing the series since the books are on audio and this one was done well.",13,1 comment
