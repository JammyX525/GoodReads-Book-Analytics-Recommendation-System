16299,And Then There Were None,chai ♡,321,15000,4,"August 14, 2022","There is scarcely any comfort to be found in this book; only an indelible, arcane horror. And Then There Were None was uncomfortable as it lodged itself in the darkest corner of my mind. The questions it asks, the implications it conceals, are soul-curdling and unforgettable. In short, I liked this book, but it's not exactly an experience I’m keen on revisiting.**In Agatha Christie’s nightmarish tableau of a novel, ten people are summoned as house guests to a remote island by a Mr and Mrs U.N. Owen. The guests assembled trade stiff dialogue over dinner and cocktails while musing about the celebrity of the island and puzzling about their hosts’ tardiness. The whimsy of the moment, however, abruptly disappears when a disembodied message blaring from a gramophone tallies, in vivid and mordant detail, the guests' unpunished crimes. What begins as astonishment quickly turns into horror when, shortly after, the house's occupants embark on the ghastly business of being murdered, one by one, per the instructions of a horrid nursery rhyme. Death runs rampant with its bloody scythe on Soldier Island: this is their sentence coming to retrieve them at last.
  “Be sure thy sin will find thee out.”
Agatha Christie, an extraordinarily good writer, digs with bright horrible relish into this exhilarating, unsettling, and brilliantly constructed story. She plays the reader with the delicacy of an expert angler, scarcely allowing us a moment to dig in our heels and stop where we are, just for a while, just long enough to get a better idea of what’s ahead. The experience of reading this novel is, as a result, sometimes akin to walking through a nightmare, unable to orient one's self, understanding very little beyond the deep-seated sense of being utterly afraid. This is intensified by the hermetic and creepy atmosphere of Soldier Island, and the slow unraveling of each of the characters' haunting pasts. What appears at first, however, to be a thriller is something far more dangerous in Christie's hands. The surface is arresting, but the harder you think the further you go, and the story keeps on getting more productive. And Then There Were None is infused with psychological depth that holds its own fascination. What are we capable of doing, asks the novel, when fear, fractured and wild, takes hold of us and scours out all else? What lengths are we willing to go to escape accountability, and purge memories of our most torturous evils? Each of the character becomes a mirror from which there’s no escape, reflecting their monstrosity back at each other on and on and on. In that sense, this novel is an invitation to take a long, hard look at one’s own self in the mirror that dares us not to flinch. And Then There Were None is, furthermore, a compelling portrait of a psychopath who suffers an unconquerable confederation of self-righteousness and depravity. But what is most frightening is not the depth of their evil, but how cold it runs. Are humans really capable of being this infatuated with the theatrics of murder? None of these characters are, of course, the kind of people you would want to roll the red carpet for, but does anyone really deserve this? 
  “Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.”
If there's a flaw running through And Then There Were None, it's that Christie maintains a respectful distance from her characters, and at times, that distance runs toward dryness. I think a bit more poison in the pen would have helped in drawing out the characters, some of whom don’t entirely step into the page before... they start dropping like flies.Overall, however, And Then There Were None is a highly engaging murder mystery and a provocative, pitch-black psychological thriller that will be hard to forget for many.","1,146",77
16299,And Then There Were None,Emily May,"1,921",29000,5,"October 28, 2012","I'm a big lover of Agatha Christie, she has written some fantastic murder mysteries and her stories never get tiring. But this is the one that just comes out on top every time.It partly, and quite amusingly, reminds me of that old American murder mystery in Sunset Beach. Basically, they're the only ones on this island and someone is killing them off one by one in accordance with the Ten Little Indians rhyme . And I swear I never saw it coming, and I'm usually very good at it. It's just a very clever novel, full of mystery and suspense and easily quite frightening at times.I like how Agatha Christie doesn't have to write a 500 page novel with a massive back story, her mysteries are very simply put together but always clever and hard to decipher. I would recommend this book to everyone.",862,50
16299,And Then There Were None,Nataliya,710,11300,4,"October 17, 2022","This lovely mystery book is first and foremost about the administration of the long-overdue justice, right? At least that's what the mastermind behind it all believes.But the question is - who has the right to decide what justice is? And who is to decide what punishment serves the crime? And is perceived justice at all costs the ultimate goal, or is it the frequently pointless work of a maniac? As a matter of fact, what is justice after all?
  
I think the story of this book (the one that may win the contest for the most offensive original title, after all) is familiar to most readers. It is a lovely and fascinating idea. Ten people are lured onto a remote island under false pretenses just to realize that they are all about to be punished by death for the 'crimes' that they have committed in the past and have gotten away with. Killed in a manner predicted by a silly yet ominous children's poem with the conclusion of ""... and then there were none"". What's more, they come to realize that the mastermind - or maniac? - has to be among them. And the (very polite, in the traditional British way) game of survival begins, complete with all the necessary societal rituals¹ and classism² that are not disposed of even under the threat of imminent demise.¹The politeness and overt show of respect to one another even in the face of imminent murder by someone in their midst - because, of course, you would not want to offend anyone. Continuing to socialize and take meals together. Insisting on chivalry when a woman could be the murderer just as well as a man - these are just some of the examples.² Just think of everyone expecting the impeccable service by the butler even though HIS WIFE JUST DIED! Everyone deciding to stick together and be careful - but never including the servants in it. The belief by some that people of 'proper class' would be incapable of murder. The list can go on and on. And all of these assumptions prove to be wrong.
And as, despite the precautions, the number of people trapped on the island continues to decline, the uneasy tension sets in, and the impeccable facades begin to crack.""The oth­ers went up­stairs, a slow unwilling pro­ces­sion. If this had been an old house, with creak­ing wood, and dark shad­ows, and heav­ily pan­elled walls, there might have been an eerie feel­ing. But this house was the essence of moder­ni­ty. There were no dark corners - ​no possi­ble slid­ing pan­els - it was flood­ed with elec­tric light - everything was new and bright and shining. There was nothing hid­den in this house, noth­ing con­cealed. It had no at­mo­sphere about it. Some­how, that was the most fright­en­ing thing of all. They ex­changed good-​nights on the up­per land­ing. Each of them went in­to his or her own room, and each of them automatical­ly, al­most with­out con­scious thought, locked the door.""The story is captivating and very smart, and the ending had me baffled for a bit the first time I read it. It has a neat resolution despite an obvious plot hole (but hey, it doesn’t bother me that much). It's an enjoyable read to say the least. But what made me unsettled both of the times I read it was the nagging question of justice, as I mentioned above. Yes, on one hand, it's almost poetic justice to punish the criminals who thought they got away with it. On the other hand, is eye-for-an-eye the best way to get even? And who's to judge, anyway? Who is either conceited enough or deranged enough to assume that he has the right and the moral authority to determine guilt and the extent of punishment just like that?Don't get me wrong - the people accused on the island are undeniably guilty (even though it's not necessarily murder as we think of for some of them - Vera Claythorne is really guilty of neglect, albeit with a desire to kill, and Emily Brent is pretty much guilty of being a judgmental über-righteous heartless prude). But the degree of their guilt varies quite significantly in my perception, and it does not always coincide with what their 'unknown' judge/executioner thinks (running two children over with a car and feeling no remorse is to me worse than firing a pregnant servant who then goes on to kill herself, for instance). And is arbitrarily and single-handedly determining their guilt and doling out punishments not just as much (or even much worse) or a crime than they have committed? Conceited, self-righteous crime? Decide for yourself. 
  
Speaking of guilt - this novel has quite a bit to say on this subject. You see, many of the characters have already been judged and condemned by their own selves. Vera Claythorne and General Macarthur both are tormented by their guilt, and at least one of them become a direct victim of it. Interestingly, others, no less guilty, are not tormented by their conscience at all. But ultimately this does not matter at all for their survival; only the fact that they were deemed guilty. So should being tormented by guilt versus a cold-blooded killer factor at all in the administration of justice?These are the thoughts that kept running through my head as I was reading this excellent non-traditional critically-acclaimed specimen of mystery literature. And therefore bravo to Miss Christie for making me think and care - and not just mindlessly flipping pages to get to the bottom of the whodunit. Because 'WHO' was much less important to me than 'HOW' and 'WHY' - especially 'WHY'. For all of this, I give it the unflinching guilt-free 4 stars.——————Also posted on my blog.",539,46
16299,And Then There Were None,jessica,"2,476",29600,3,"June 5, 2020","i want to start off by saying if i had been alive in 1939 and read this when it was first published, i would have given this 5 stars. without a doubt. theres a reason this story is one of the best-selling books of all time - the concept paved the way for the 'whodunnit' mysteries of today. i would have been riveted by this story.that being said, because the influence of this book is so far-reaching, it didnt feel like it was new. ive read this format in many other novels and seen it in many films. this isnt the books fault - its just an unfortunate consequence of exposure. i also am not a fan of ACs writing style. it feels so sterile to me. yes, the characters and facts are presented in a very straight-forward way and its very easy to follow along, but the lack of descriptive narration just isnt my style. i also feel like all of the characters are carbon copies of each other - i was constantly confusing them because there is no personalisation to their characterisation. i do like the concept and can appreciate the phenomenal influence this story has had on modern writing, but the execution prevented me from loving this entirely. ↠ 3 stars",478,12

It's really a big house on an island. Still, it's famous for being a party place, and nobody in the group turns it down.BIG MISTAKE.Almost as soon as everyone is gathered together, a recorded voice booms out through the walls and accuses each of them of being a murderer.

Of course, everyone immediately starts proclaiming their innocence!Wha..? Noooo! That person died accidentally! I was never even a suspect! Who dares...?!

16299,And Then There Were None,Mary ~Ravager of Tomes~,347,912,3,"May 10, 2018","And Then There Were None is one of Agatha Christie's most celebrated mystery novels, and purportedly one of the most difficult for her to write. I don't dislike this book. It seems to be a favorite among many, but it's very middle of the road for me as far as Mystery/Thriller books go. 
  The Good:
I enjoy the setup & how this mystery is structured. It's fun & easy to engage with in a ""Gee, I sure am glad I'm not in their shoes"" kind of way. It's written well with an accurate insight on human desperation & how psychosomatic effects can drastically warp one's sense of control. The length (only 264 pages) & pacing of this novel is very appropriate. It gives adequate page space to the mystery & the characters, acquainting the reader quickly with the situation so that we can dive straight into the action.
  The Bad:
I did not care about even one of these characters past seeing the creative ways the author would kill them off. They're developed & believable as people, but I never felt any type of connection or sympathy which I think can be quite important in a story like this.Sometimes the characters don't matter or can get away with being stereotypical cardboard cutouts, but that tends to shift the over into the torture porn arena & I don't believe for a second that is where Christie's book belongs.Probably the most disappointing part of my experience, I was not impressed with the conclusion of this mystery. Right off the bat, I didn't feel engaged with the actual solving of the problem because it felt as though I was kept at an arm's length from any of the potential clues. Call me an idiot, maybe this was obvious for other people? But I genuinely don't feel as though readers are given a chance to make even an a semi-educated guess about who the perpetrator is.It relies wholly on the very, very last section of the book to lay out the details for what they are & explain the unknown bits. It's very: ""Oh, by the way here's what happened.""Anti-climactic to say the least.When I'm reading a Mystery/Thriller, I want to feel as though I'm being challenged to figure out what's happening before the characters do. I'll be the first to admit I almost never guess the truth in its entirety, but that's beside the point. I was to the point where I was almost ready to believe something supernatural was happening. Not a great sign.When the truth is finally exposed, I had a hard time feeling as startled as I'm meant to feel because I've seen this story before in popular media. Now, this came out in the 1930's and so this isn't by any means the fault of the book itself. It probably came first in every instance I'm thinking of. But as a modern reader this didn't pack the same punch it might have if I were a reader of the 1930's. Anyhow, that's another classic under the belt!",345,70

If you somehow exist in the in-between, here you go: This is a good and satisfying story and it's fun.

16299,And Then There Were None,PirateSteve,90,328,5,"February 12, 2019","One of the worlds best selling books of all time, Agatha Christie's ""and Then There Were None"" sets the standard for crime fiction. The book was first published under a different title in jolly old England, but even back in 1939 American publishers were far too politically correct to use a title they found so offensive. Still again, in 1964 and again in 1986 a third title was published but political correctness struck again. I read the book under the authors original title because I wanted to read it as she intended it. The book has inspired radio broadcast, stage adaptations, television mini series, several movies, board and video games.  As the 1939 story begins, 8 unacquainted guest have been invited to a very large home on an isolated island off the coast of England for a type of holiday. When the water ferry drops them off they find their host has not yet arrived but there are two staff members there to meet their needs. Soon it is brought to their attention that all 8 guest along with the 2 staff members are accused of various murders from their past. Then the first of the guest drops dead. By the next morning another of the remaining 9 is found dead. There is surely a murderer on the island and as the story continues to unfold the reader is never given any information other than that which the guest may encounter. I didn't figure out who done it. I do know that I didn't do it. But you fellow reader ... the way you so innocently stopped to read this review. Perchance to see if any incriminating evidence has been uncovered..  Very suspicious, I say. ",312,46
16299,And Then There Were None,Charlotte May,670,1025,4,"March 23, 2018"," “Watch and pray. The day of judgement is at hand.”  Now I understand why Agatha is the Queen of crime! This was addictive. A group of people are all individually invited to an island for a summer holiday in Devon. None of them 100% sure who their mysterious host is. Things become even more peculiar when their host isn’t there when they arrive, and doesn’t show themselves at all. One by one the guests are killed, picked off, leaving the others terrified and paranoid. It was a fantastic mystery throughout. As tension becomes hysteria, the guests wonder who will be next, who is responsible for these murders and why?A fantastic read that leaves you guessing until the very end.  “We shall none of us leave this island.”  ******************************So creepy!

16299,And Then There Were None,MarilynW,"1,032",2562,4,"February 3, 2021","And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie and narrated by Dan Stevens.A couple of my friends have been reading Agatha Christie books and seeing their reviews stirred an interest in them because I've never read Agatha Christie before. I feel like this book was an excellent introduction to Christie and I had a grand time trying to figure out just what was going on and who was doing what. Once the characters were introduced, I printed a page of their names and descriptions so I could keep them straight more easily. I enjoyed the entire book but was appalled by how many times the term ""tinned tongue"" was mentioned. As much as I enjoyed the story while the ten victims were alive, I enjoyed the epilogue even more. Usually, I don't enjoy so much ""telling"" but in this case, we'd seen so much earlier in the book, without full understanding, that I was thrilled we were able to get the answers to everything.

16299,And Then There Were None,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,"1,878",22600,5,"July 29, 2020","$1.99 Kindle sale, July 29, 2020! If you've never read one of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries, this one is my favorite!Every once in a while on Goodreads I find myself feeling compelled to make a True Confession, and here's another one: I'm not all that much of a Hercule Poirot fan. For someone who's read probably 30 or 40 Agatha Christie books over her lifetime, that's probably an odd thing. I like him okay, I don't DISlike him, but yeah, he kind of irks me sometimes. So when I'm picking up an Agatha Christie mystery, I'm always a little bit tickled when it doesn't involve Poirot. This is one of those books, so it already had a leg up on the competition when I started it.And here's the other thing: with all the Christie books I've read in my lifetime, there are only a handful that I've found really memorable. This, again, is one of those books. In fact, plotwise I would say it's my favorite Christie book of all time. Many Christie fans consider it her masterpiece.Eight very different people are invited to an isolated island off the coast of England. Fairly soon it becomes apparent that they all have one thing in common: they've all been accused of murder but were never convicted or brought to justice. Each person has gotten a written invitation to the island, tailored to their needs or situation, like a job offer or a holiday invitation, most of the invitations coming from someone they don't know who signs the invites as U.N. Owen. Together with the butler and cook who are already on the island, there are ten people. They gather for drinks and to meet their U.N.Known host. While they are waiting, a few things happen:1. They notice a framed copy of the nursery rhyme ""Ten Little Indians"" hanging on the wall, in which the Indians* leave, die or disappear one by one, until there are none. There are also ten Indian figurines on the dining room table. 2. Mysteriously, a recorded voice begins to speak, describing each of the characters in turn and accusing them each of committing murder but evading justice . . . until now. 3. One of the guests laughs off the shock and quickly downs a drink. And immediately chokes and dies. One of the ten figurines is soon discovered to be broken, and the nursery rhyme reflects his manner of death (""One choked his little self and then there were nine"").So begins an intense tale, as the guests frantically try to protect themselves and figure out which of them is the killer (or is it someone else hiding on the island?) before they are all dead. And at the same time, they're all dealing with their own feelings of guilt to varying degrees. And the figurines keep disappearing--DUN! DUN! DUN! The psychological exploration in this book is great, beyond anything I recall reading in any other Christie mystery, and the reveal at the end completely surprised me.*Content note: For the record, some readers may have qualms with this nearly 80-year-old novel's dicey history of racial slurs and insensitivity. It was originally actually titled Ten Little Niggers, based on the British version of this poem, which apparently wasn't considered offensive enough not to use in England when the book was first published in 1939. For the American edition of the book, it was changed to ""Ten Little Indians"" and, later, ""And Then There Were None"" (which is the version I have, but still with the Indian poem and figurines) - better but still not great. I understand that many recent editions now use ten little soldiers for the poem.",225,37
16299,And Then There Were None,Brina,873,4,4,"January 5, 2017","This year I have decided to take part in a women's century challenge in the group catching up on classics where the participants read a book written in ten consecutive decades. I chose to focus on the 20th century and my 1930s selection is And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie. Although I had previously read some of her Hercule Poirot cases, this is my first stand alone mystery of Christie's that I have read. A suspenseful premise for a case, And Then There Were None left me on edge for the duration of the book. Ten individuals who committed murder at one point in their lives have been invited to Soldier Island for a supposed holiday. Upon arrival, the participants note the quaintness of the island and the home which they are staying in. Yet, on top of the mantel in each bedroom is the poem ""ten little Indians"". In the communal dining room are ten salt shakers each representing a person and the same poem. As the group gathers for cocktail hour, a gramophone recording announces the crime each individual is guilty of committing. Shocked at first, each person comes to terms with the accusation and reveals what really happened to the group. Christie's participants represent a cross section of society including a judge, doctor, Scotland Yard police officer, retired general, mercenary, governess, and spinster. None of these primary participants believes themselves guilty of the crime because after all they were acquitted. Yet one of their party believes them all to be guilty, or they would not have been invited to Soldier Island. One by one the group is murdered, the island is searched, and the dwindling group realizes that there is a murderer in their midst. The death mirrors the poem on the wall, and as each person is killed, another salt shaker breaks. It is up to the remaining people to identify the murder. Unlike Hercule Poirot cases where Christie allows the reader to crack the case early on only to have Poirot peal back layers and layers to the case, in And Then There Were None, Dame Christie does not clue us as to who the murderer is. Even someone as myself who reads a fair number of mysteries was left captivated as to whodunit, allowing me to read quickly until the end of the book. The participants were also held in suspense, accusing each other of being the murderer. This lead to a revealing denouement, one that had me guessing until the last page. I have read many mysteries written by women, including many cases starring female private eyes and police detectives. Many of these mystery writers have Dame Agatha Christie to thank for paving their way as early as the 1920s. And Then There Were None first appeared in serial form, leaving its readers in suspense until the next installment appeared. A captivating mystery, I am open to reading more of Christie's stand alone cases, and rate this mystery 4 stars. ",211,22

16299,And Then There Were None,Alejandro,"1,106",3542,5,"July 23, 2014","Extraordinary and gripping novel!I knew that the best way to start reading the literary work by Agatha Christie was choosing her most known book. And There were none is the best-selling mystery novel of all time with 100 million of copies, and the fifth book in the list comprehending all genres. That is something to give to Agatha Christie the respect that she deserves.Initially this novel on UK was titled Ten Little Niggers, only because the original nursery rhyme was called that but it was obviously seen as racist, then in USA was decided to change the title to Ten Little Indians, but again obviously as seen as racist again, so at the end the title was changed to And There were none, and the nursery rhyme inside the book was changed to ""Ten Little Soldiers"", curiously enough none member of any army so far as pointed out as racist that final change. I mean, the title was just because a widely known nursery rhyme and none character on the book was afro-american or native-american. To this, I want to comment that it's lucky that not many children would had more nightmares since a lot of nursery rhymes have truly scary lyrics. No wonder in stuff like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Saphire and Steel were used nursery rhymes with truly scary effects.Returning to the novel, it was a remarkable reading. Great atmosphere where you feel as trapped as those people on that island.I want to comment that at some point I figured it out who was the murderer, don't worry, I won't tell it, and I have no doubt that some would say: ""Oh, sure! I believe you Sherlock!"". However I do indeed discovered it. This is not my first mystery story. I have read several books in the genre and I have watched a lot of TV shows like Murder, She Wrote, Columbo, Criminal Minds, CSI: Miami, etc... And while that doesn't turn me into a detective, in my defense, I knew who was only because I focused on the ""why"" and not the ""how"" that certainly I didn't know that. You can say that I did an amateur criminal profile and that helped me to have a suspect of my own that it resulted true. Also, I had some advantage for being Spanish speaking since there is a clue that only can be detected due that not matter that I read the novel on English, but taking in account the very detail that it's indeed a printed novel, I catched something and putting together some clues. Well, I figured it out. Believe or not. It doesn't matter.Anyway, I think that many of the fun of reading this kind of mystery novels is trying to figure out the culprit during the process of reading the book. Not matter if you guess right or not, always it's rewarding when the mystery is explained. A delicious way to make your neurons to exercise.Again, knowing who was, or at least thinking that I knew who was, since obviously I couldn't confirm it until reading the whole book, it didn't help me to know how everything was made until it was explained on the novel. Definitely, Agatha Christie is the queen of mystery!Certainly, this novel isn't only a marvellous detective mystery book but also a truly scary horror story. Priceless setting for a scenario and fantastic twisted character developing.
  Appendix: (July 23rd, 2014)
The clue that I found thanks that I am a born Spanish-language speaker:WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!Read ONLY if you already read the novel, since this is a mega-spoiler telling who the culprit is!I seldom put spoilers in my reviews, but I wrote this appendix basically since I was contacted by several readers asking me about the ""big clue"" and well, while I don't mind to share it, well, also I don't want to find out later that it was written down in some other review as theirs, taking in account that it seems that only me were the one who noticed that.Ok, the big fuzz about the clue that I found is that the first character that you find in the novel is Mr. Justice Wargrave on the chapter one, you may say: ""So what?"", well, the mysterious couple who invited to all guests, the initials of both names of them are U.N.O., in the imaginary woman is ""Una Nancy Owen"" and the supposed husband is ""U.N. Owen. U.N.O. that in Spanish can be spelled just like ""uno"" which means ""one"" on English. Maybe that a coincidence, but with Agatha Christie nothing can be left to chance, so I think that may be a clue targeted to the readers with knowledge about Spanish language. ",190,65
