38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Chelsea *Slowly Catching Up* Humphrey,"1,388",77200,4,"October 3, 2022","An Unwanted Guest gave me all the Agatha Christie feels! It's been so long since I've read a locked room (err... hotel) mystery, and while I had my doubts going in, I found this book clever and witty. The character development was pretty darn good for a book that rolled in at less than 300 pages; in fact, this is mostly a character driven thriller, using the tension between the cast to ratchet up the suspense for those brief moments of action. I'll definitely need to check out Lapena's backlist of books; if you're new to them as I was, I found this to be a great place to start!Book #2 for my #25infive read-a-thon. Buddy reading with Dennis @scaredstraightreads!",430,58
38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Yun,505,1800,3,"May 22, 2022","There's something about mysteries that take place in secluded locations, I just can't resist.Guests are checking into a small lodge in the middle of nowhere, looking forward to a romantic and relaxing time. Alas, a winter storm blows through, knocking out power and contact with the outside world. One person dies by what seems to be accidental means, but when a second person dies, it's clear something sinister is afoot. Is it one of the guests, or is there an unknown, mysterious interloper on the loose?This was a bit of a mixed bag for me. On the one hand, I found the premise and initial setup thoroughly intriguing. Just like the best Golden Age mysteries, there is a limited set of suspects, and everyone is acting questionable and hiding something. In fact, the cover of the book compares this to Agatha Christie, which is high aspiration indeed.But unfortunately, after the great start, the mystery didn't really come together the way I was expecting. What's amazing about Agatha Christie is that all the clues are there, and when it's explained in the end, you feel like you could have figured it all out if only you'd been a little bit more clever. But with this story, there were no clues for me to put together and solve, and the reasons became known only when the book chose to reveal it. That takes a lot of the fun out of the mystery, at least for me.Another letdown is that the characters act all panicked and wacky, which leads to more drama than is necessary. I've noticed that this is a trend of modern mysteries, where instead of offering great clues and red herrings, a lot of them just have characters acting crazy as the element that propels the story along. In fact, there were a few weirdly emotional characters who I was hoping would get murdered to be rid of their annoying presence.Still, if you don't go in expecting a mystery with actual clues, then this is an adequate one. The setting is atmospheric, the premise is interesting, and the unfolding of the plot is engrossing enough. I'm glad I picked it up, even if the mystery didn't quite live up to its potential.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Not a Happy FamilySomeone We KnowThe Couple Next DoorThe End of Her~~~~~~~~~~~~",342,77
38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Miriam Smith (A Mother’s Musings),"1,478",148,5,"July 24, 2018","I loved Shari Lapena's previous books ""The Couple Next Door"" and ""A Stranger In The House"" and couldn't wait to start reading this, her latest thriller ""An Unwanted Guest"". It didn't disappoint and I have to admit that this one is actually my favourite of the three and in my opinion her best yet.The intriguing plot echoes an Agatha Christie style murder mystery and is set during a freezing cold and violent ice storm that leaves the guests at an isolated hotel stranded without power. As the guests (each with their own story or deep buried secret) start to die in mysterious circumstances, the terrifying suspense is instantly ratcheted up, therefore making the book impossible to put down. I really did find it gripping and since we are currently experiencing an uncomfortable heatwave this book certainly cools you down. The descriptions of the ice and snow and freezing conditions in the hotel made me feel as if I was there with the guests and since the author brings her brilliant characters to life each one felt exceedingly real. I like plots where you can try to guess the murderer in a realistic scenario and I have to admit I did get the killer wrong. The ending was very well plotted and thought out and from start to finish I thoroughly enjoyed reading this compelling and suspenseful book. I very much look forward to more by Lapena in the future, I like her writing style, plot lines and her ability to engage the reader and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this page turner of a book to thriller readers young and old and especially those that love a good old fashioned whodunnit murder mystery! 5 stars",320,65
38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Debra ,"2,125",34900,5,"June 5, 2018","A quiet weekend in the country, far away from the stress of the outside world sounds like a dream getaway! Mitchell Inn is a warm and inviting Inn which is nestled deep in the forest. Snow is covering the ground adding to the Inn's beauty and charm. It's a place for lovers to enjoy time together, a place where an Author can work on her book, a man can enjoy some alone time, friends can re-connect, and for a couple in an unhappy marriage can take a look at their marriage in a beautiful setting. But the storm is unrelenting - the snow has not stopped falling and soon the roads are not drive-able. The guests and the owner and his son are trapped at the Inn for the weekend! Everyone remains in good spirits. They will make the most of it! They enjoy some drinks and make small talk in the lobby. Everyone goes to bed with hopes of still enjoying their weekend until the next morning when a body is found! It appears their relaxing weekend will not be so relaxing after all.This was a really fun book! Not fun in the funny-I-laughed-out-loud-way but it was a fun and devilishly clever whodunit. This book is an example of a whodunit done right! Shari Lapena has created the perfect setting for this book- a beautiful inn in the middle of the woods. Such atmosphere! This book consists of interesting characters with even more interesting back stories. This is a book I want to tell everyone about but at the same time I also want to tell people to go in knowing as little as possible. I loved watching the characters try and figure out what was happening. They are trapped (by the storm), frightened and tensions are rising. There is obviously a killer in their midst, but who????I thought every single page in this book was wonderful. I have read this Author before and enjoyed her work, but this book knocks it out of the ball park! This is a very clever and well thought out mystery. Women's fiction my foot - this is a mystery book at its best! There is nothing graphic or gory in this book. It won’t scare or titillate but it will keep the reader guessing. Those that follow my reviews, know I like to put on my super sleuth hat and try to figure out whodunit. I did not figure it out, in case you were wondering. If there were clues, I did not see any! I couldn't help but think of Agatha Christie while reading this book. I almost feel as if this book were an homage to Christie - that's my thought- the Author does not say. Nevertheless, I was glued to my seat, turning the pages, and wondering what would happen next.The sheer genius of this book is that not a lot of action takes place, the characters are trapped in the Inn, no one can get to them and they cannot get out. So, the strength of this book lies not only in the carefully thought out plot but in the characters themselves, in their dialogue, their inner thoughts and interactions with others. Each time I had to put this book down, I was disappointed. If I could have sat and read this book in one sitting, I would have. The pacing in this book was spot on! Nothing in this book is rushed, nor is it slow. I was captivated from page one and highly recommend this book!

38240386,An Unwanted Guest,megs_bookrack,"1,423",8962,4,"November 12, 2022","**3.5-stars rounded up**An Unwanted Guest has redeemed Shari Lapena in my eyes. I feel so relieved I don't have to write her off completely!Sort of joking, but not really. To say I hated was less than enthusiastic about, The Couple Next Door, would be putting it mildly. ((cough)) Very mildly.I have some really great Book Buds who love her work, so I said I would give her another shot. You know, in the spirit of friendship.After reading An Unwanted Guest, I am glad that I did. I knew going in that this novel would be more in my comfort zone; being a 'locked room' mystery, one of my all-time favorite tropes. A cast of characters shut in a confined space, cut off from the rest of the world, when the bodies start dropping. Whodunnit? Y'all know, I am trash for this.This had the formula of a classic Christie tale. The cast is introduced quickly, with none of them being particularly likable. They all check-in to a fabulous, secluded old hotel, the interactions begin and before you know it, someone is killed.The setting for this is a family-run hotel where our guests go to escape from the world, reconnect within their relationships and unwind. However, when a powerful ice storm hits, the electricity is knocked out and the MURDERS begin. These weekend warriors get much more from their holidays than they bargained for.As I mentioned previously, none of the characters were particularly likable, in the traditional sense, but they were definitely interesting. Everyone seemed to be hiding something and I had absolutely no idea who the killer was. After hidden information was finally revealed, all fell into place. I liked it. I really liked it. There was a special little twist at the end that I felt was really fun and satisfying. Overall, I am super glad I gave Lapena another shot and I will definitely pick up more books from her in future!",236,36
38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Michelle ,846,1181,2,"August 8, 2018",Well that was underwhelming. An odd ball cast of characters decide to spend the weekend at Mitchell's Inn. This decision they will all soon regret when the guests start dropping like flies. Reminiscent of Agatha Christie but not nearly as impressive we've got a whodunnit where every one becomes a suspect. Something about Lapena's writing style just didn't work for me here. It's safe to say that it is ME and not the BOOK this time around. This should have been so up my ally but I just felt it lacking. I will say that it's a quick read and I didn't guess who the killer was. Though as I reflect back I do see the clues I missed along the way so kudo's for that. I just wished I cared when the reveal came and I didn't. I am happy to see that so many others appreciate and love this novel. I'm sure I'll still be all grabby hands for her next one whenever it comes out.

  Mitchell's Inn is a quiet resort, tucked away in the Catskill Mountains. Guests are checking in, but will they all check out?
The hotel is three stories with a grand staircase, reminiscent of Gone with the Wind.  A forest surrounds the hotel and it has a grand lawn which is all covered in pure white snow. This should be the perfect setting for a quiet, relaxing weekend, but it 
  will not be
.The hotel isn't full. Six rooms will be occupied out of the twelve available. Some folks seem to have cancelled due to the snow storm approaching. We begin to meet some of the guests as they are checking in and learn why they wanted to book the weekend.  There are quite a few characters and I had to ""get to know"" before I was able to keep everyone straight.  Once I sorted them out, I had no problem following the story line and I sure had some strong opinions about a few of them. One I would liked to have smacked.The storm is getting worse, everything is icing over, there is no wi-fi , no electricity and 
  the wind is howling like someone is trying to get in
 (I was starting to wonder if someone was). After a body is discovered the next morning, people are quick to start pointing fingers.  Everyone's secrets start coming out, and suspicions are spreading like fire.A couple of ""gaspy"" moments and much guessing made this one a quick read.  Some parts became a bit repetitive with the mystery circling around a few times, but the ending put 
  a smile on my face. :).
Recommend to readers who enjoy who-dunnits with atmospheric settings.  Thanks to the publisher and EW for my copy to review and give my honest opinion.",174,70
38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Norma,551,11800,5,"August 5, 2018","4.5 Stars! A weekend getaway at a cozy mountain lodge I would say is my ideal getaway but if I’m snowed in with no power and a murderer amongst the midst with no way out…...I’d be totally scared right out of my wits! AN UNWANTED GUEST by SHARI LAPENA is a fast-paced, tension-filled, compelling, suspenseful, and a chilling read that immediately grabbed my attention and kept me pretty much guessing right to the very end. Although, there are a few clues that I did pick up on, it did not spoil the actual reveal for me at all. Oh, and that final twist in the end…..total shocker and I absolutely loved it!SHARI LAPENA delivers an atmospheric, appealing and cleverly written read here that has an old-fashioned whodunit storyline, a huge cast of characters and an extremely eerie and haunting setting. Even though this book has several characters in it I was never confused in who was who or had any trouble in keeping them all straight. The setting, characters, and vintage feel to this story is what I found the most entertaining and enjoyable.

38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Paromjit,"2,501",24500,4,"July 6, 2018","Shari Lapena writes a crime fiction mystery in the style of the classic golden age of crime. In the beautiful snowy Catskill mountains and forests, beside the Hudson River, is the location of Mitchell's Inn. The snow has brought its problems as many of the staff at the Inn have been unable to get to work, leaving owner and chef, James Harwood, with only his son, Bradley, to help look after the guests who have managed to arrive. However, the weather deteriorates even further as the place is gripped by an all encompassing ice storm, leaving the Inn with no power or telephone line. Wi-fi is not available, so guests are offered a secluded relaxing break, away from the frenetic pace of their everyday lives. Matthew Hutchinson, a wealthy New Yorker, has arrived with his breathtakingly beautiful bride to be, Dana, looking to escape the chaotic planning of their wedding. Ian Beeton and Lauren Day are a couple who have come away for a naughty weekend. Beverly Sullivan hopes to reignite some passion into her marriage with husband, Henry, getting away from their boisterous teenage children. Beverly and Henry's relationship had dwindled to the point that they were purely functioning as parents with no sexual content in their marriage for a considerable length of time. Candice White is a writer who has plans to write her latest book away from the drudge and energy sapping role of being a carer for her mother. David Paley, a criminal defense attorney, is taking a break from his highly stressful and pressurising job. Gwen Delaney has persuaded her best friend, Riley Shuter, that her shattered nerves and anxiety will benefit from staying in a rural and peaceful haven and give them the time for Gwen to help her. Riley is a journalist suffering from PTSD after the horrors she has witnessed and experienced in Afghanistan, she is prone to panic attacks and plagued by flashbacks.At first, the strangers mix well on arrival, but fear and menace creep in when one of the guests is discovered dead at the bottom of the staircase, and evidence suggests that it might not be an accident. As unease increases, there is no doubt that a killer is amongst them when another guest is strangled. More murder follows, and no help is at hand, with the police completely uncontactable. Tempers fray, as no-one is above suspicion and the guests harbour thoughts as to who is the murderer. Secrets emerge and feeling desperately unsafe, unable to sleep or trust anyone, will they survive until the police arrive? Lapena writes a great story that made me nervous and unsettled as I tried to work out the real killer. If you like Agatha Christie and writers of that ilk, I think you will like this too.

38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Kaceey,"1,004",3515,4,"October 11, 2018","Welcome to your weekend getaway... A group of unsuspecting guests arrive to a snowy, mountain inn for a weekend away from everyone and everything. Each has their own personal reasons for being there. Re-kindle a faltering romance, repair a once close friendship. Maybe even a working weekend. Whatever the reason, it was going to be a pleasant getaway.But by early the next morning, things take a drastic turn. A body has been found at the bottom of the staircase at the Inn. And that's only the beginning... Everyone is in danger... everyone is a suspect! Told from the POV of every guest there! I was concerned I might struggle keeping the large cast of characters and their POV’s straight. Happy to report, that was never an issue! “I love a good murder mystery, don’t you?” This was a light, thrilling joy-ride of a read! Kind of a refreshing palate-cleanser between the darker thrillers I usually read! Kept me in the dark and guessing right to the end! And no... I didn’t guess correctly!

38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Sumit RK,332,443,4,"April 27, 2020","For a murder mystery, An Unwanted Guest gets the setting perfectly right: A cozy lodge nestled deep in the wood, during peak weather and in the midst of a snowstorm, with many interesting characters. When the weather takes a turn for the worse, and a blizzard cuts off the electricity--and all contact with the outside world--the guests settle in for the long haul. Soon, the weekend getaway turns deadly, as some unknown killer starts killing the guests one by one.  The plot may remind you of And There were None and this is the closest anyone has come to writing an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery. Though their writing styles are unique, this is a perfect example of a murder mystery done right. From the setting to the creepy atmosphere to the interesting characters (with even more interesting backstories), everything falls in place nicely to create an amazing reading experience. Apart from the plot, the characters are very well crafted. Each character looks like a suspect and you are no closer to solving the mystery, till the very end. The pacing in this book was perfect. I felt the ending was well explained though it offers very little clues beforehand. Lapena does a great job of building suspense and leaving enough unanswered questions about each character. The book does feel bit short on the action at times and given the atmosphere, I was expecting a lot more scares and false alarms. Also, there were no clues for the reader to put together and solve till the very end. Yet, it manages to throw a lot of suspects throughout the course of the story. The author did an excellent job with the atmosphere building which makes you feel like a part of the story. Overall, An Unwanted Guest is a fast-paced and entertaining read. This novel has some clever twists and turns which will keep you hooked till the end. Recommended for Mystery and Thriller Fans.

38240386,An Unwanted Guest,ELLIAS (elliasreads),478,37200,2,"January 5, 2019","My first read of the year. And it was not good. Shari Lapena is not for me. After I read, The Couple Next Door, which I immensely disliked, I didn't think I would ever read another book from this author. I was wrong. I gave An Unwanted Guest, another chance because the premise sounded promising, and believable.... too good to be true....boooooyyyyyy....The writing was what threw me off. It was.....really bland. And made the whole experience really slow and plodding...uninteresting. The characters were another poor aspect. None of them were likable or relatable and almost everyone made really, really stupid decisions regarding how to stay alive. And for a book that only had 290 pages....there was only so much happening. For a book about nine plus people.....only two characters were killed within 200 pages. That took waaay too long for anything to happen. And the ending literally wrapped everything up in like five pages. what.It was exasperating to say in the least. January 2019 was off to a great start. But not with this.2 meager starsTwitter | Bookstagram | Youtube |",140,22
38240386,An Unwanted Guest,Melisa,324,513,4,"July 27, 2018","A very entertaining whodunnit!This murder mystery gave me all the CLUE vibes and I loved it so much! A large cast of characters trapped in a remote hotel during a snowstorm with no electricity or cell service? Yeah, sign me up. This one has a large cast of characters - it definitely also reminded me of an Agatha Christie novel, some reviewers have compared it to And Then There Were None which I can totally se as well. I generally get lost when a bunch of characters are introduced all at once, but the characters were so distinct that I was able to easily keep track. Super proud to say that I’ve gotten my detective shoes back - I actually figured this one out after a drought. Look for the hidden clues and you might figure it out too!🕵🏻‍♀️After reading two books by this author, I can say the writing style isn’t really my jam, just a personal preference.

This was a gripping, addictive and highly atmospheric thriller that had me flying through the pages! The setting is a remote, old fashioned luxury hotel where guests arrive to spend a relaxing weekend in vintage lavishness. They arrive just as a brutal winter storm hits, cutting off electricity to the hotel along with any possible contact with the outside world. The plot unfolds as a whodunit murder mystery – is the killer among the guests or is there someone lurking in the shadows of the hotel?The characters were great! Though there are several characters and relationships to keep track of, Shari Lapena does such a wonderful job developing them that I could follow the storyline effortlessly. I loved what each character brought to the mystery. My mind was spinning trying to piece together this intricate and twisty tale. This was a Traveling Sister read.
