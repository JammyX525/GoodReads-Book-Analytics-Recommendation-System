40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,Nilufer Ozmekik,"2,065",38100,5,"January 27, 2023","APPLAUSE! APPLAUSE! APPLAUSE! One of the quickest, one of the best crazy roller coaster experiences I had as soon as I took this book into my hands. Still shaky, blubbering (I already requested a translator to communicate properly), nail-less, confused, dizzy but also smiling and happy! GAVE MY FIVE FULL MYSTERIOUS SHINING STARS! GREAT STORY TELLING, ATTENTION TAKER PLOT, FANTASTIC CHARACTERIZATION, FAST AND HEART THROBBING PACING AND GREAT-SATISFYING ENDING! What are you waiting for guys? The book is NOT going to fall from the sky and drop on your lap! Go and buy it and send me thank you letters for my encouraging words!We have an amazing heroine, Pippa (don’t confuse her with longstocking) Fitz-Amobi loves to search, pry, dig into, talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave, stands between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, older version of Harriet Walsh, with her technical skills, tattoo-less and leather-less, chain-less version of Lisbeth Salander and a younger version Molder-less and alien nation-less version of Dana Scully!  Blurb is tempting, amazing, intriguing makes you dive in, clasp the book into your fingers and never let it go as I did. My dogs are jealous of the book by barking to the moon to protest me. But I resumed my reading because it was gripping, hooking you from the first page kind of book.  Five years ago, Andie Bell got missing and presumed dead by Sal Singh who committed suicide and sent a text message confessing his crime before he’d killed himself. But Andie’s body had never been found. The case is close! But Pippa is determined to open it by starting her own investigation process to write her school project and she firstly knocked Sal’s family door to ask an interview with his 20 years old brother Ravi who naturally becomes partners in crime with her and their project which turns out the mission for proving Sal’s innocence and finding who might have killed Andie!  As they start to dig more, the person of interest list of Pippa becomes longer, includes Pippa’s best friend’s sister.  There are too many questions screaming inside your head:  Who really killed Andie? Or Andie is really dead? Did she deserve her ending? Because as soon as we learn more about her, we discover she is a bully, drama queen, drug dealer, blackmailer! Her amazing attributes gave me itchy fists to punch her. (It’s strange because I never wanted to kick presumed dead person or I’m not sure she is dead person! Well, that’s a first because this character is living, breathing -or not- scumbag!) Who put the blame on Sal? Or Sal really did it? Well, he’s portrait of nice, humble, angelic guy made me call him Castiel as like Supernatural’s angel character. But we can sense he has been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies about his where beings and his leaving time from their place and rejected to be his alibis. So where was he at the murder time? Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa to stop her digging? Well, I made one of my fastest reads and my spider sense didn’t work properly to find the killer or killers till the last pages. The author was always ten steps ahead of me! I’m so blessed to be beaten by her smart writing. I had great time to visualize this as a great YA mystery movie or limited Netflix series! (Anything could be better to replace the third season of 13 reasons why which could be named as 13 reasons of list why the hell did you shoot the third season!!!) It was moving, enjoyable, nail biter, mind bending, surprisingly exciting, satisfying read. I enjoyed every page, every clue, every thrilling moments of this book. I highly recommend it! It was even better than One of Us is lying! And the best news is there are 3 more sequels to come out! I already started my excitement dance which is between Beyonce- All the single ladies moves and Staying Alive-Travolta moves. Yay!bloginstagramfacebooktwitter","2,980",45
40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,megs_bookrack,"1,423",8962,5,"January 25, 2023","You heard it here first, folks. I have found a new favorite YA Thriller. I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!","1,341",91

  ""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""
Move aside, Nancy Drew! There's a new teen detective in town. And she won't rest until she's unearthed all your secrets and gotten to the bottom of a mystery that has long held her town captive.Pip never truly believed what all of Fairview has accepted: that Sal Singh murdered his beautiful and popular girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself. Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she's going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I'm always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I'm in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it's best if I'm so taken with the story that I'm only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I've outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I've been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers. And the fact that this is a series means I won't have to say goodbye to her just yet.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#2. Good Girl, Bad Blood#3. As Good As Dead~~~~~~~~~~~~",769,151
40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,Sofia,294,5913,2,"February 9, 2021","I refuse to believe that the first half and the second half of A Good Girl's Guide to Murder are, in fact, part of the same book.Half One: 1 starA few years prior to the start of this book, a girl named Andie Bell vanished into thin air. Sal Singh murdered her and then committed suicide.Allegedly. But Pippa is determined to solve the mystery and prove Sal innocent. With the help of Sal's brother, Ravi, she interviews suspects, tracks down clues, and proves her mettle as things get dangerous. This was just utterly ridiculous and nonsensical.To start with, Pippa Pig decides to solve a murder mystery as her senior capstone project. And she expects to succeed. She wants to prove Sal innocent just because he was nice to her once a few years ago.She goes around interviewing people related to the Andie Bell case, who conveniently confess their secrets and inner thoughts to her. Apparently, the police never even bothered to talk to them, because ~logic.~ She goes as far as to actually break into people's houses and look through their stuff. She breaks a dozen laws, blackmails people, hacks some Facebook accounts. And she does this to prove someone innocent. What, may I ask, is the point in proving Sal innocent if you're committing crimes while doing it? She somehow thinks it's excusable to invade people's privacy to clear the name of one person. Sal was proven guilty, so all she's doing is getting herself in trouble. On top of that, Pip has no personality. Her entire character is based off of this mystery. This is a common theme in thrillers/mysteries--a boring main character. But in a book with a very uncompelling mystery, it needed something more. I think she's supposed to be a ""good girl"" because she likes doing homework and she's very focused on school. That's her sole personality trait.And the information she discovers relies entirely on coincidence. Oops, Pip found a weird photo. Oops, it connects neatly to the next clue. How convenient. Live footage of Pip and Ravi: Live footage of me:Half Two: 3 starsAnd then this book skyrocketed.I'm honestly still impressed with the way it ended. Even though I knew the ending was purely based on the very coincidental evidence uncovered in the first half, I was still shocked. Suddenly, the pace picked up. I actually wanted to continue reading. Ravi became a great character, instead of just a random guy there to be token diverse. Everything pulled together a little too neatly. The murderer confessed everything in a very cliche monologue. But I do think it was a great wrap-up. All the clues were tied together intelligently, and I genuinely enjoyed the second half.However, A Good Girl's Guide to Murder isn't remotely believable. It relies heavily on coincidence and the audience's indulgence, so I have to give it a low rating. 2 stars, since when was Pippa Pig a detective?",572,88
40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,Chelsea *Slowly Catching Up* Humphrey,"1,388",77200,5,"September 7, 2022","Surprise! I was asked to write the recommendation for this story on the Book of the Month website, and I'm thrilled to finally be able to share it with you as it's live on the site. If you'd like to go directly to the page, you can click HERE, just keep scrolling below if you are outside of the US and not a subscriber. As a reader who developed her book obsession by devouring every Nancy Drew installment in elementary school, I've been an avid enthusiast of YA crime fiction for most of my life. I cannot resist a good mystery, and am always on the hunt for the next ""it"" book in the genre. I'm a busy mom of two, so it is rare for me to find a book so special that I can finish it in two sittings, but that's exactly what I found with A Good Girl's Guide to Murder.Pippa Fitz-Amobi is a true crime loving teen who aspires to become a top-notch journalist one day. So naturally, she decides to focus her senior capstone project on her small town's most buzz-worthy, unsolved crime: the murder of Andie Bell. What begins as a simple proposal quickly turns into an in-depth investigation full of unexpected twists and turns. After teaming up with the alleged murderer's brother, the pair spiral into a web of danger and obsession, and quickly wonder if they've gotten themselves in too deep.This debut reads as if you are investigating alongside the main characters, and fans of true crime podcasts will rejoice in the multimedia formatting that so wittily engages the reader from beginning to end. If you enjoy a grounded, engaging mystery that features a diverse cast, discussions surrounding racial injustice, and the importance of found family, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Whether you are aged 13 or 102, this book is for you!*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.",530,50

40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,2,"May 15, 2020","Well, it appears, I've been reading YA mysteries all wrong these past years. Evidently, I should not expect plausibility, believability, character development or strong motivations in these books, like I do when reading adult mysteries. No wonder there is only ONE teen mystery that I think is good, and actual teens don't even like reading it, from what I hear. (It's Sadie in case you were wondering). A Good Girl's Guide to Murder starts off as a Serial rip-off, with upstanding Pippa swooping in Sarah Koenig-like to clear the name of a poor brown guy accused of the murder of a popular girl whose body remains missing. You see, it's only Pippa who believes in Sal's innocence, and she will save the day, because she is a GOOD GIRL and Sal was once nice to her years ago! I was already annoyed at that point.However, from there this story devolves into a sleuthing adventure where Pippa manages to have every Tom, Dick and Harry confess all their misdoings to her, because PIPPA IS WRITING A SCHOOL PAPER ABOUT THE MURDER. She catphishes people, breaks into houses, blackmails drug dealers, discovers 5-year old evidence in plain view, because she is just so much better than the police at everything. I can understand why police wouldn't care to pursue a case of a Who Drew The D!cks or The Turd Bulrglar  variety, but a suicide and a presumed murder? And the victim is still missing and nobody but Pippa cares? Have you heard of Natalie Halloway? She disappeared 15 years ago, and she is still on TV. The whole investigation was one giant eyeroll for me.Anyway, to put it short, this book has nothing that I look for in a mystery. I am not reading any more YA mysteries if suspending disbelief entirely is the main requirement to get through them. I am just going to stick with Courtney Summers from now on. Thankfully she has another one coming out next year, and it's about cults!

40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,jessica,"2,476",29600,4,"December 14, 2020","this story is giving off such strong ‘serial’ vibes that i can only imagine how amazing listening to the audiobook version would have been. a re-investigation of a cold case, including detailed diagrams and evidence files, with a really interesting mystery and suspects - what more could you want? this is every true crime enthusiasts dream story. the one thing preventing me from giving this five stars is the same thing i tend to find obnoxious about most YA mystery/thrillers - the need to include every crime imaginable. this murder revolves around drugs, rape, pedophilia, underaged drinking, cyberbullying, child abuse, vehicular assault, and a lot more. by the end of the story, its just too farfetched to be realistically believable. such a shame.but overall, this story is solidly entertaining, one that i would have absolutely no problem recommending to people. now excuse me while i go redownload the entire first season of ‘serial’ to listen to again. ↠ 4 stars",311,23

40916679,A Good Girls Guide to Murder,Meredith (Slowly Catching Up),770,12100,4,"February 19, 2020","SMART GIRLS RULE!A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder is a smart YA mystery/thriller about a 17-year-old girl who investigates a murder that rocked her small town 5 years ago. Pippa “Pip” Fitz- Amobbi to conduct her Senior Capstone project on the disappearance of Andie Bell, a high school senior who was presumed to be murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh. Shortly after Andie went missing, Sal killed himself and confessed to her murder. But Andie’s body was never found. Convicted by the town and the press, Sal’s name is permanently marred and his family is viewed as the town pariahs. To determine if Sal really was guilty, Pip uses her intelligence and quick wit, to examine multiple angles and threads that were overlooked by the police. This is not a conventional class project, and while it seems a little over the top in the beginning, Pip’s character approaches it in a way that makes sense.
  “If a villain can be made, then he can be unmade.”
Pip makes for a great heroine. She is intelligent and strong and has the knack for seeing things that others ignore. A self-identified nerd, you can’t help but root for her. She also is very much 17 years old and a little naive to the ways of the world. I would compare her to a softer version of Veronica Mars.  I was a little apprehensive from the start because I am not a huge fan of Young Adult novels, but this one worked for me. In the beginning, I was constantly thinking “what’s a 17 year old going to find that the police did not.” However, once it became clear that there were gaps in the police investigation that Pip was able to see, I was sold. Also, Pip’s approach to solving the case and getting people to talk about Andie and Sal, etc. helped solidify that this book was the real deal and not just about a kid who happens to luck into solving a crime. Jackson takes a multimodal approach to share Pip’s investigation; the narrative switches from the third person to interview recordings to pages in a diary to email exchanges, which kept it interesting and added an element of realism. While I was a little hesitant to read this, I was so glad I did. I quickly became immersed in the narrative, wound up loving Pip’s character, and enjoyed the plot--I figured out the murderer very early on, but there were a few twists that threw me for a loop. I look forward to seeing where Pip’s crime-solving skills lead her in the next book in the series!",253,68
