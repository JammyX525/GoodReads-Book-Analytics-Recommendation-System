13145,Along Came a Spider,Ryan Gillespie,1,75,5,"September 18, 2014","James Patterson. The man writes a book and you read it. It's plain and simple. He knows how to write a mother-fucking story. This wasn't the first book I read but damn. The dude keeps makin' a brother come back for more. It gets even better when you're reading a book about the REAL OG: Alex Cross.Short attention span? James Patterson's books come automatically equipped with small chapters.Enjoy reading before bed? Forget about it. You're laying down in bed, right? HAIL NO. This shit has you on the edge of your seat. Your brain may be tricked into thinking that you are laying down but the reality of it is that you are actually sitting up in a tricked out leather chair by the fireplace smoking a pipe.Don't smoke a pipe? Doesn't matter. You will be. This book is off the chain. You'll be speaking nothing but eloquence when you're done reading a James Patterson book. What comes after eloquence? Smoking a pipe. You're doomed.Like to see someone get bu-bu-busted big time? Alright Pauly-D. These bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks. You know what that means? That means someone's getting jacked the fuck up.If you like reading, getting smacked in the face with plot twists and actually relating to characters in a book, check out my dog James Patterson. This book is a great intro to his writing.",574,63
13145,Along Came a Spider,James Tivendale,306,1305,4,"March 1, 2017","I am honestly speechless after reading that. Everything that a thriller should be. I am embarrassed to say that this is the first James Patterson book I have read (excluding his book shot series).Although I was unfamiliar with his work- I think everyone who likes fiction has heard of Alex Cross.He was one of many standout characters in this novel. Alex Cross, detective, doctor of psychology, hypnotiser, friends of the poor people when he helps out at a food shelter, respected by the black people for never leaving the 'hood following his glittering career, great family man and a bit of genius who cannot give up a case. Although hard and rough when he needs to be, practical as they come - the crimes he sees sometimes upset him - such as deaths of young children. Enter our villain:Gary Murphy/ Soneji. Actor. Manipulator. Tortured past. Horrid present. Other important characters include Alex's best friend and partner, sunglasses wielding 6'6+ copper Sampson & FBI agent Jezzie Flannagan who is part of Alex's team of experts to hopefully solve the world's most infamous case.The story commences with a kidnapping of two children from a $10,000 a term school by a Maths Teacher! One was the son of the Secretary of State. One was the daughter of this fictional world's equivalent of Angelina Jolie. There are also a few brutal murders that have been lurking around the suburbs that are a bit too grim to describe here. The book talks a lot about cruelty to children - and we have seen both sides... people who have received this agony and viewpoints of it being given. Macabre! How does this all fit together? When I thought I knew where this book was going... Patterson would kick sand into my eyes and it would take a crazy direction. I thought I had been metaphorically blindfolded by the author, kidnapped, dropped off in the woods 70 miles away with Patterson laughing at me grotesquely; saying - here are a few clues - figure this out! Hahaha!Friends and colleagues might not be that transparent. Is the villain a psychopath or a sufferer from multiple-personality disorder? Will the families pay the ransom? Do the children survive? Are the kidnappings related to the murders? Is there an accomplice? Is it even deeper than that? How many deaths can one person cause? Who can we trust? I won't mention the specific twists or plot too much as that is what makes this book special. It was brilliantly written. Mixing up pacing here and there. Slow scenes with Alex and Family. The middle-paced romance scenes with Alex and a special someone and also blood-racing turn-the-page 700 miles an hour sections.This was brilliant. I wish I had more of his Alex Cross novels. I might watch the film but I have heard it isn't very good.That was a thrill. Detective Inspector James x",118,8
13145,Along Came a Spider,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"May 17, 2022","Along Came a Spider (Alex Cross, #1), James PattersonJames Brendan Patterson is an American author. Along Came a Spider is a crime thriller novel, and the first novel in series about forensic psychologist Alex Cross. First published in 1993. Alex Cross is a homicide detective with a Ph.D. in psychology. He works and lives in the ghettos of D. C. and looks like Muhammad Ali in his prime. He's a tough guy from a tough part of town who wears Harris Tweed jackets and likes to relax by banging out Gershwin tunes on his baby grand piano. But he also has two adorable kids of his own, and they are his own special vulnerabilities. Jezzie Flanagan is the first woman ever to hold the highly sensitive job as supervisor of the Secret Service in Washington. Blond, mysterious, seductive, she's got an outer shell that's as tough as it is beautiful. She rides her black BMW motorcycle at speeds of no less than 100 mph. Alex Cross and Jezzie Flanagan are about to have a forbidden love affair-at the worst possible time for both of them. Because Gary Soneji, who wants to commit the ""crime of the century,"" is playing at the top of his game. Soneji has outsmarted the FBI, the Secret Service, and the police.تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز شانزدهم ماه می سال2018میلادیعنوان: همراه با یک عنکبوت آمد؛ نویسنده: جیمز پترسون؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده21منامدارترین کتابهای «جیمز پترسون» درباره ی شخصیت «الکس کراس» میچرخد؛ «کراس» روانشناسی در «واشنگتن دی سی» است؛ از این سری «الکس کراس»، رمان‌های «همراه یک عنکبوت آمد» و «دختران را ببوس» با بازی «مورگان فریمن کراس» فیلم نیز ساخته شده است؛ تا کنون بیست و نه کتاب، و چند داستان کوتاه از این سری «الکس کراس» منتشر شده اند؛ در کتاب «همراه یک عنکبوت آمد» آنگاه که به «الکس کراس» یکی از کارآگاهان شهر «واشنگتن» گفته می‌شود، که یکی از اعضای خانواده‌ اش به قتل رسیده، او سوگند می‌خورد، تا قاتل را پیدا کند؛ و به زودی کارآگاه درمی‌یابد، فرد مقتول تنها قربانی ماجرا، و جریان آنگونه که او میاندیشید نبوده است...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 26/02/1401هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",76,N/A
13145,Along Came a Spider,Sharon,946,182,4,"February 7, 2017","This is the first book I've read in the Alex Cross series and it won't certainly be the last. James Patterson is a fabulous author as I'm sure many would agree and when it comes to writing a page turner he sure knows how to keep the reader turning the pages at a fast pace. Along Came A Spider is a book with the lot, mystery, crime, suspense, oh and did I mention it's a cracking thriller. I can't wait to get my hands on the next book in this series. If you haven't read this book then do yourself a favor and please go and read it. I'm very sure you won't be disappointed. ",60,15
13145,Along Came a Spider,David - proud Gleeman in Branwen's adventuring party,211,471,4,"April 2, 2016","I have been recommending this book for years. Yes, the movie adaptation was terrible…yes, some of the later Alex Cross entries were somewhat weak (I’m looking at you, “Violets Are Blue”). But the first book of the Alex Cross series is still an amazing read. What really made this book work for me was the antagonist, Gary Soneji. He’s chilling and creepy, yet he’s still utterly fascinating. The game of cat-and-mouse between Alex Cross and Gary Soneji is gripping and exciting.However, the book is not perfect…I did have to deduct a star, as I really didn’t enjoy the portrayal of Secret Service agent Jezzie Flanagan…I found her to be a grating character, and wished the time Patterson spent on her could have been used for any of the other more-interesting characters. Still, it may not be perfect, but “Along Came a Spider” is still a great suspense novel. ",51,3
13145,Along Came a Spider,Sue,"1,315",5,5,"December 15, 2016","ALONG CAME a SPIDER (Alex Cross, #1) is the classic thriller that launched the Alex Cross series, the #1 detective series of the past twenty-five years! Excellent book. full of action and a ending I never saw coming! This novel is a game of cat-and-mouse between Detective Alex Cross and psychopathic villain,Gary Soneji, and will have you flipping the pages to see what will happen next. ",48,60
13145,Along Came a Spider,Macy_Novels at Night,23,50,4,"February 16, 2019","Along came a spider popped my James Patterson cherry. I struggle to sway from my usual favorite authors, and I am working on venturing out and getting some new favs. As a writer, I also feel this is the only way to check out other styles and grow by other author's genius. I have never seen the movie to this book, but I felt like I was watching an action movie the whole time. There were parts that bothered me a bit that I feel could have been left out, but I also understand the authors need to move the book forward and give the reader the information they need to understand the story. There were times that I felt the writing was a little wordy, but I am also used to authors that have a cleaner cut style. I liked his style, and all in all I will read some more of his books and learn from his writing as well. I will now watch the movie! The ONE thing that this book could have done without and the reason it has 4 stars is all of the puns and corny cliché lines. I could see giving just one character this personality, but many of his characters had a cliché lines over and over again in the book, including the children. His children characters were the age of 13, but it took me a while into the book to realize it as he made them sound at first like they were 5. Each time I heard one of the lines I could not help but roll my eyes, because the book would have been much better without the corny lines. But well done otherwise! ",45,3
13145,Along Came a Spider,Sanjay Gautam,222,434,2,"July 21, 2015","It was a few years back that I read Along Came The Spider. I found the plot is predictable just like those typical Hollywood thriller movies. I could not find the book much engrossing, and was rather disappointed by the climax which was a cliched twist, and ruins whatever was, if any, good in the plot before. It was only the psychopathic villain, Gary Soneji, that appealed to me. Whereas Alex Cross, the detective, was very boring. All in all, it was a below average read which I would not recommend.",45,7
13145,Along Came a Spider,Juli,"1,844",470,4,"June 20, 2018","James Patterson started his best-selling Alex Cross series in 1993 with Along Came a Spider. There are now 25 books in the series. PBS included the Alex Cross mysteries on its list of 100 books and series for The Great American Read. This prompted me to check out an audiobook of the first Alex Cross book and take a listen. Wow....I'm sorry it took me 25 years to try this series. I loved the character and the book! Alex Cross is a metro detective in Washington, D.C. He's raising his two kids with the help of his grandmother who he affectionately calls Nana Mama. She raised him after he lost both his parents as a child. Things are dicey in D.C. A poor black family is murdered in their home. Two children from an expensive day school are kidnapped. A teacher from the school is murdered. The crazed murderer and kidnapper keeps adding more crimes to his list, including shooting up a McDonalds restaurant. Cross wants to find the kids and capture the suspect. As he investigates he finds that this case involves a lot of politics and a plot that goes much further than a psycho math teacher. Alex Cross is such a strong main character. He has his flaws, but he is dedicated to his job. He loves his Nana Mama and his kids. I enjoyed seeing the character develop throughout this thriller. He deals with prejudice, Washington politics and bureaucracy. I like the fact that he is a psychiatrist on top of being a detective. He's able to get into the heads of his suspects, and his background aided in the investigation of the kidnapping. I'm definitely going to read more of this series! Once I started listening to this book, I couldn't stop. We are in the middle of painting our house, and Alex Cross kept me company while I worked a lot of hours outdoors. It made the time pass so quickly! Totally mesmerizing story! I did not see several twists coming. I love it when a thriller novel surprises me!Along Came a Spider is the 10th book I have read from the 100 books listed for The Great American Read. I'm glad this series was included. I can see why it's been a best-selling series for decades. Very gritty and suspenseful!This is the first book by James Patterson that I've read. I'm a bit late on the scene....but I'm definitely going to read more of this series, and other books by Patterson. Along Came a Spider was exciting, realisitic and quite enjoyable. ",40,8
13145,Along Came a Spider,Rachel Reads Ravenously,"1,787",2130,3,"July 27, 2019"," 3 stars I went through a whole James Patterson phase when I was in high school. His original work, where it’s just him writing without another author, is great. There’s a reason he became such a success over the years. Along Came a Spider was never my favorite by him, Kiss the Girls and 1st to Die are his best works in my opinion. But when doing a reread, one wants to start at the beginning.This book follows the kidnapping of two children, both with very influential parents. Alex Cross of the Washington DC police is among the team working to find them. You don’t need to know much more plot than that. For being written in the early 90’s, I am impressed that Patterson chose a strong, intelligent and educated black man to be the hero of his series. He addressed the prejudice Cross faced, along with his challenges that Cross has worked to overcome. I remembered 3 key plot points, but had forgotten much else so it was almost like reading a new book again. I also became extremely nostalgic when reading this book because my grandmother loved James Patterson, and when I was a teen and a college student we would talk about his books. Reading this book made me miss her very much.Newer mystery lovers might not love this style, it is definitely very different from modern mystery storytelling.",34,2
13145,Along Came a Spider,Janie Johnson,865,130,5,"February 26, 2019","This is a re-read for me from 2 years ago. I had forgotten that I already read it, but either way I am so glad that I am finally to get to the Alex Cross series. I enjoyed this one probably even more than the first time I read it. This is the first book to the series. I have had several of the books for awhile now. I have read plenty by James Patterson and have enjoyed just about all of it, so I expected this book to be just as good, and it really was.The plot to this one was very fast paced, it really kept the story flowing well and kept me engaged from page one. I found nothing that was draggy or slow with the story. There were also some pretty unexpected events that took shape in this one. I loved the action and excitement that came along with this first book and I look forward to much more of that in upcoming books of the series.I really enjoyed Alex Cross as a character right from the start. He has a good head on his shoulder, but he does have some issues which makes him flawed, and I love a good flawed character. I look forward to his development throughout the series. I also enjoyed a few of the other characters as well, such as Nana Mama, who is Cross's grandmother, and I also enjoy Sampson who is Cross's partner in crime. Both of them together really make this an enjoyable series.I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Patterson and has not yet read this series. I also recommend this to those who just love mystery in general. There is plenty to keep anyone interested and turning the pages.",25,10
13145,Along Came a Spider,Nicole,707,1732,2,"March 15, 2022","This book was very boring, I couldn't care less about what's going on. The way we continuously changed perspectives made me just want to finish. I don't think I'll be trying Patterson's other books in this genre.",22,2
13145,Along Came a Spider,QuinnReads,"2,699",101,5,"May 15, 2022","Serial ManiacI've read this two, maybe three, times over the years. It's a gripping tale and a fantastic start to the series.
  UPDATED 5/2022:
It's time to try audio for this book. I own the book but wanted to try something different as I catch up with the series from the beginning. I forgot how unsettling the beginning is. Being a parent now probably has something to do with that. Ok, it has a lot to do with it. My perceptions and what I observe over time have shifted.Honestly, there is a lot that I've forgotten about this book as a LONG time has passed since I last read it. As it came back to me, I really was impressed by the story as it unraveled. The lies, the truths, and everything in between. The story touches on so many things that are true still. Southeast DC and crimes that occur there are still looked down upon and given a lesser priority. Wealth matters when resources are assigned. Skin color frequently plays a role in perceptions. Women still have to constantly prove themselves when they reach for a ""man's"" job. I borrowed a copy of the audio book from my local library. The narrator is Charles Turner. Charles does a good job but he just doesn't sound like the Alex Cross in my head. Admittedly, the one in my head 
  might
 sound a bit like Morgan Freeman. Hmm... I wonder why. 🎞 📽 🎬Story: 4.5 starsNarration: 4 stars",21,2
13145,Along Came a Spider,Suzzie,906,164,4,"January 21, 2018",So interesting! I haven't seen the movie so this whole plot and the characters were new to me. I found it very entertaining with some great twists! Now that I am done the Women's Murder Club I am trying to decide between Patterson's other series to read now. Really thinking this is the one I will read first! My quick and simple overall: psychology and criminal justice is so it for me! My two majors in undergrad and graduate school!,21,1 comment
13145,Along Came a Spider,Jack Heath,"5,259",84,5,"January 22, 2022","5 Stars. I couldn't stop reading. It's that good. What a debut. Dr. Alex Cross, a black psychologist and police detective, and his life-long friend, John Sampson, also a detective, are investigating another brutal homicide in the projects in Washington DC, when word comes that two young students have been kidnapped from an up-scale private school. Why should they leave their pressing case and join forces with the FBI and the Secret Service? It's not fair, but one of the fathers is US Secretary of the Treasury and Alex reluctantly gets drawn in. And later, just as unfairly pushed aside. This is the first time we meet Cross, one of the great fictional personalities introduced in the mystery - thriller field in recent years. It's a page turner, perhaps because author James Patterson also brings us one of the most vile criminals ever encountered, Gary Soneji. Then there's Secret Service Supervising Agent Jezzie Flanagan. She's not just eye candy, but in that department, her relationship with Cross steams. There's even a reference to the Lindbergh baby kidnapping in 1932, which remains controversial to this day. Can you read 500 pages in one sitting? I needed a long-weekend. (November 2017)",19,1 comment
