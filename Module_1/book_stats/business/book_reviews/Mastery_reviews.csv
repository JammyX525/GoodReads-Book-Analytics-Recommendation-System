13589182,Mastery,Tom,363,85,5,"January 19, 2013","Robert Greene’s The 48 Laws of Power is his most notorious work, so blatantly amoral that many of its adherents are rumored to hide in the closet. But since its publication, his work has gradually taken a moral turn. In his follow-up, The Art of Seduction, Greene mentions having compassion for one’s “victim”—he or she being seduced. The 33 Strategies of War instructs readers that there is no moral value in ignoring certain tenets. In Mastery, which concerns the pursuit of virtuosity in one’s field (and, according to Greene, ends the journey that began with 48 Laws), Greene finally mentions the value of a “great contribution to society.” Elevating this brand of altruism over self-aggrandizement, the book becomes his most essential work.Greene’s format hasn’t changed much. He details six steps to Mastery, typically beginning chapters with an anecdote from history about a Master—the first here being Leonardo Da Vinci (who, with his diverse career, was a wise choice). Then he moves through gorgeous passages on figures such as the Wright Brothers or Albert Einstein, concluding with Goethe’s life story. What separates Mastery from the rest of his oeuvre is that Greene’s emphasis on his subject’s importance in the 21st century forces readers to play close attention.Consider The Art of Seduction. After finishing, a reader will watch a flirtatious couple and think to herself, “They’re doing it all wrong.” Thus her worldview has been changed forever. Still, the book is targeted at those who can tolerate seeing life as a stage, and most people would prefer their own version of reality. In Mastery’s case, Greene clearly believes it crucial that we all become Masters of our skills for our planet’s future. Thus after we read the stories, we are locked in to his deconstructions. Here Greene actually makes the same case for the seductive lifestyle, but this time it is gravely serious instead of guiltily pleasing.Few will find the book inaccessible—Greene covers virtually every possible field and often includes the connections between them, such as Yoky Mastuoka’s work on robotics and tennis. Some might raise eyebrows when told that in childhood their career field was clear to them, but Greene compensates with a “reversal” addressed to those who lacked such direction, or, later, to those without the capacity for social intelligence. Rarely is Greene blunt about the specific issues facing our age, but parsing his implications can be its own adventure—is he speaking of hipsters in describing the ironic attitude? Does he believe, like Goethe foretold, that our information overload is leading to cultural decay? The flaws in Greene’s prose haven’t changed. He overuses “Understand” and “Think of it this way:.” The problem with such repetitive phrasing is that just having read it in the last chapter, our brains are inclined to think we’ve read what follows this before, and so we skim. Furthermore, the length can be trying, and one wonders about the necessity of eight or nine stories for one of Greene’s steps—the constant shifting of setting and characters can render some sections hard to focus on, and even harder to recall.Yet, as with his previous work, there is a method here, and it works in the book’s favor. Greene is not David Foster Wallace, nor does he wish to be—he includes just enough SAT words to read as authoritative but layman-friendly. And the aim of the over-length is to upload his ideas into the reader’s mind so that we ruminate sufficiently. In our attention-deficit culture, concision can be frivolous. Hence Greene’s loquacity might be precisely what will have Masters mentioning his book as an influence 10 to 20 years from now, and this time out of the closet.Rating: A-",298,9
13589182,Mastery,Filip,75,15,5,"December 31, 2012","I spent almost as much time getting myself to write a review for this book as I have reading it. Is it a five star book? Is the repetition of featured stories (you know what I'm talking about if you've read it) such a big deal? Am I just getting fooled by Greene and riding an emotional high of ""anything is possible to master if you set your mind to it""?I've slept on it for long enough to conclude that this book indeed IS brilliant.  It completely shatters the myth of iconic people being destined for success by birth or some wild genius feat. Many of the great masters had an unremarkable upbringing. Some, like Marcel Proust, turned their waste of time itself into mastery (hence the ""In Search Of The Lost Time"", his centerpiece). The primary difference between masters and ordinary people is that the masters never gave up on their craft and took as long as it was necessary to perfect it. Mozart may have been a child prodigy, but it took him almost a decade to write a composition of value. After 10 years of pondering, Einstein's theory of relativity came to him in a flash minutes after he completely disregarded any solution.This is such a great opportunity to have a closer look at what made the likes of Mozart, da Vinci and others into forces of nature that they were in their time and beyond. As a reader, you leave empowered to set on your path and create your own masterpiece, realizing you do have what it takes - but it's a marathon of patience and hard work, not a 100 meter race piled with gold.",188,15
13589182,Mastery,Courtney Rene,80,8,5,"November 14, 2012","We all are searching for power of some type. We may not say it out loud, but deep inside we all know that this is a true statement. Whether it’s power through success or power through knowledge or whatever, we are all searching. On this quest for power we usually find that we have personal obstacles that get in our way, that we struggle to overcome, and block us at every turn. This book, Mastery by Robert Green wants to teach you how to overcome one of the biggest obstacles we face. The obstacle that holds us back the most. The obstacle of ourselves. It could be in the form of fear of failure, or in the form of disability, or the lack of knowledge we seek but the obstacle in the end is ourselves. Even so saying, one of the greatest things about being human is the ability to continue to evolve, to learn all throughout our lives. This book sets out the 6 keys or steps to overcoming and obtain that power we are desperate to achieve. Helps us reach the goal that we all are striving for, that power over ourselves to become extraordinary. Power to be the masters of our own lives. This book is a great addition to anyone’s library. With its antidotal stories or the peak into the lives of people that used the Mastery method, this book is an enjoyable read as well as an easy learn of the keys. For anyone out there searching to become something more, something exemplary, this is the book for them.",93,3

13589182,Mastery,Dave Bolton,192,78,2,"May 11, 2013","Unfortunately a mess of ideas and misconceptions (did you know that Albert Einstein discovered relativity due to spending a badly estimated 10,000 hours thinking about it over 10 years?) that did little to illuminate mastery. Lord, even the table of contents is confusing.Some of the profiles are interesting, but they are also repetitive. Each time a profile is incrementally built on, one has to read all the parts that were earlier presented, which is a ridiculous way to treat a studious reader.If you want to learn about the mechanics of mastery, I like George Lenard's simple book Mastery.

If you want to master the skill all by yourself not taking any help then you would lose decades of time, so, learn from the masters. Mastering a skill is frighteningly difficult task, but you could attain by learning from the masters who have patiently yet fiercely spent decades of time for their discoveries and inventions.1) The apprenticeship phase: Follow your inclinations. In this phase you dedicate 10000 hours of your time in learning your desired skill, need to put in your effort by overcoming obstacles and boredom. You need a teacher from whom you can learn, be respectful, obey at all costs by letting go of your ego.2) Creative active phase: After learning the skill inside-out, you start experimenting on the skill by being creative, you need to let go of the fixed mindset, complacency and need to accept criticism.3) Mastery: You've been a humble student and has attained the knowledge about the internal semantics of your skill, it's time for you to invent something new and substantial with your knowledge.This cannot be read as if it were a novel, there's a lot to absorb, patiently devour the content and take notes.",50,N/A
13589182,Mastery,Rrrrrron,231,15,1,"August 20, 2013","For a book that received mostly 4-5 stars on amazon and audible, this was particularly bad. So many other books on what drives success are so much better. For instance, Talent is Over-rated. Or Outliers. Or Drive. And the message is work hard and find something you are passionate about so that you work hard. Two main reasons why the book is so terrible. First, it was meandering and long-winded trying to tie stories about evolution and human history to 'mastery'. And that was mostly nonsense and bad ugly speculation or fiction by the author. And totally unnecessary to whatever 'mastery' he is trying to sell. He does the same thing for historical figures who are known to be successful. For instance, somehow Marie Curie found her calling after spending time in a lab. Charles Darwin thought about the prospects of going on the Beagle and found his calling. Many people were filled with great sense of calling and came to nothing. What does any of this have to do with 'mastery'. Not much it turns out. Second, he goes on and on about examples of success and getting into that 'zone' where you are in the mastery zone and describing it over and over without any new insight. Sorry that is just inspirational jibberish. ",41,6

13589182,Mastery,Olly,12,22,1,"December 17, 2020","We are all geniuses in the making, short of hard work and the right luck, so believes the populist Robert Greene.For a book treating 'masters' as a scarcity in our population, now made all the rarer by ironic attitudes towards skill in a technological age, Greene introduces his book with the guarantee that every reader can find their inside talents and master them.Stories of past 'Masters' are woven into threads of highly speculative narrative fallacies. What did Da Vinci think on his death bed? Did the once-underachieving Darwin narrowly escape the priesthood by joining the Beagle due to his childhood obsession with collecting?It's hard to follow Mr. Greene's selective reasoning in all these stories of survivorship bias, and apply it to our own lives.The conviction he so confidently writes with is to be expected in a self-help book, but the omissions of modern sociological findings against his own theories shouldn't be. It's clear that outside of these stories there is no easy single thread to be found connecting the mastery of Mozart to that of Einstein or Keats, except perhaps that they didn't have to read an instruction manual on finding their own inner greatness.Greene doubles the already-specious 10,000 hours that Gladwell claimed to lay behind genius. He also claims to have spent his own 20,000 hours in researching and writing this book, and in doing so has possibly given us the greatest proof against his own ideas.",33,2
13589182,Mastery,Mark Bao,29,222,5,"January 18, 2015","4.5/5, rounding up. Best book I've read in a while, mainly because it's one of the few books I've found on long-term skill and personal development for excellence. The main thing I got from this book is: Mastery is the process of gaining knowledge in the right ways, in a field that you feel closely connected to, while in the process arranging support structures that increases your propensity of gaining that knowledge (especially mentors), then applying what you've learned to certain projects, with the ultimate goal of attaining a deep, intuitive understanding of your field from which you make progress. The intuition part is essential: his theory is that we gain deep knowledge about a field, so when we face new problems, we are able to activate the disparate parts of our deep memory that turn things up. That's why, say, Jane Goodall is so good with animals: given a lot of situations, she's faced similar ones before, and can apply her knowledge and experience.What I got from that is that the process of mastery is a long one, and most take a long time to gain the raw knowledge and intuition necessary for mastery. But there is a path that we can take to do so, to gain that key knowledge and intuition, and for each of the steps along that path there are ways to do it right. From the biographies of the Masters that are profiled in the book, you get to see the amount of bullshit and the trials and tribulations that they went through to gain mastery—and you also wonder about the ones who, in the same position, understandably gave up.I've always been one that has wanted to identify the inefficiencies and get to mastery faster without those inefficiencies, but this book made me think that there are key things that we just have to do to attain the level of knowledge and excellence necessary. It's really not easy to gain mastery or be excellent, but it can be attained.Key ideas from each section:1. Find your calling. Society (Society! —Alexander Supertramp) leads us away from this calling. And a lot of the time, our origins give us the right answer for what this might be—that is, what we are naturally drawn to.2. Apprenticeship is necessary. When you've figured out this calling, you have to learn as much as possible. What you are gaining from this stage is not only knowledge but also character. (Knowing how to work, in a way.) The necessary tasks during this are: deep observation (understanding the environment), skill acquisition (getting the tacit knowledge), and experimentation (trying out what you've learned). The goal of this is to gain the raw knowledge; this can be a long process, and to want to skip it is folly. To want to gain recognition and whatnot at this stage is also a distraction (which is something I disagree with: gain as much recognition as you can, that is legitimate, and make sure it isn't overblown. Don't be quiet.) Understandably, he calls part of this stage ""Submit to Reality"", and that's what you're doing: submitting to the idea that you are unexperienced, naive, and don't know jack shit, and you're here to learn so you aren't as clueless later on. That's a hard and humbling pill to swallow, but essential, I think. There are no shortcuts.3. Mentorship helps a lot. The right mentors will allow you to gain the knowledge of other Masters. Developing these skills in a vacuum is difficult, and mentors are like catalysts. Key aspect: it should be an *active mentor–protégé dynamic*. It's not a one-way: take their ideas, challenge them. Mentorship education is a fast-track, and it gives you *direction* from someone who knows the lay of the land. Key passage:The reason you require a mentor is simple: Life is short; you have only so much time and so much energy to expend. Your most creative years are generally in your late twenties and on into your forties. You can learn what you need through books, your own practice, and occasional advice from others, but the process is hit-and-miss. The information in books is not tailored to your circumstances and individuality; it tends to be somewhat abstract. When you are young and have less experience of the world, this abstract knowledge is hard to put into practice. You can learn from your experiences, but it can often take years to fully understand the meaning of what has happened. It is always possible to practice on your own, but you will not receive enough focused feedback. You can often gain a self-directed apprenticeship in many fields, but this could take ten years, maybe more. (p. 103)4. Social intelligence is essential. To win mastery, you have to play the game, which sometimes involves dealing with politics and other bullshit. Know how to read people, and avoid the seven deadly realities that he talks about (""envy"", ""self-obsessiveness"", ""conformism""), etc. Deal with the politics—don't be idealistic and try to avoid them. Be like Benjamin Franklin in his famous book-borrowing thing. Let your work show your excellence.5. Creative phase. Apply your learnings. But the problem with this is that when we internalize a way of thinking, it becomes a lot harder to think in different ways (the curse of knowledge, also the subject of a blog post I'm working on). His solutions are: 1) cultivate negative capability, and don't fight the feeling of the unknown or uncertain—see it as beneficial, so you don't try to erase the unknown with some justification quickly; 2) allow for serendipity, by being open to serendipitous things (and perhaps engineering the space for serendipity), 3) use what he calls ""the current"", an alternating idea–application cycle where you come up with a new idea, then try it out, then refine it, and etc.—an iterative process; 4) alter your perspective, by getting out of paradigms, seeing negative cues, seeing details, seeing the ""how"" behind things; 5) using primal forms of intelligence.6. Mastery. Intuition is absolutely necessary for mastery. A great example of this is Bobby Fischer, who ""spoke of being able to think beyond the various moves of his pieces on the chessboard; after a while he could see ""fields of forces"" that allowed him to anticipate the direction of the entire match"" (p.271). Understanding your environment is key, as is building the core skills (such as focus) that go beyond natural ability, since those core skills are more sustainable.It's hard to portray the gestalt of this book, but it's worth reading. A caveat: like with all nonfiction books, and particularly with Robert Greene, you have to take the ideas with a grain of salt. Many ideas are presented without serious evidence or scientific backing, and rely on a lot of anecdata (especially with the author biographies he bases his ideas on). He relies too much on the unsubstantiated 'science' of mirror neurons. As such, we should look at the ideas in this book as just that, and not as hard-set rules, and really consider whether they are legit yourself.On the whole, this was an excellent book that presented some good ideas and also gave me a feeling of how the lives of other masters went, which both makes me feel a bit more comfortable about where I am, as well as makes me feel motivated to become more excellent like they were. It's inspiring but it also gives you a path forward. And despite the deficiencies in the strength and defensibility of its arguments, the ideas in this book and the long, longitudinal view of the importance of gaining skills, knowledge, intuition, and character to build mastery is what makes this a great book.",31,5
13589182,Mastery,Brian,55,8,2,"June 16, 2013","I won this book as part of Goodreads' First Reads program in exchange for my honest review.This book is really 2 distinct parts. The first is a series of biographies on modern and classic 'masters' in their respective fields. The second part is examining what lessons can be learned from these masters and how they can be applied in our everyday lives to become masters in our own rights.I really enjoyed the biographies, they were a series of short, concise examinations of great people that was enjoyable to read. However, I feel the application sections really didn't do justice to their subjects. The tone was so superior that it almost came off as condescending in my view. The author's book is based on 2 premises, that mastery is some lost art and that everyone should strive for mastery. The author takes a very simplistic view on the everyday world and essentially tells the reader to sacrifice everything else at the expense of becoming a master. He fails to realize that people have families that need to be supported, that not everyone will have the opportunities that those in the biographies had, that many fields are ultra competitive in this job market, and that being happy doesn't always mean being a master in your field.Because of the authors view of mastery over everything else, I found a lot of the advice to very off-putting and ineffective. There are numerous instances where the pursuit of money is belittled, almost to the point that the author almost seems to say that earning money outside of your field to be mastered is ill-advised. There is a section on getting the most out of one's mentors, then ditching them, even with advice on how to get away from them. Even parents are ever so subtly denigrated at point. I literally laughed out loud when the author tells us that people who are friendly when you first meet them at work are secretly plotting to take you down.The road to the author's mastery is to be a colossal jerk it seems. I would much rather take the path to accomplished and be nice.I gave this book 2 stars; the wonderful biographies are outweighed by the higher-than-thou advice that really became a chore to read by the end.",31,9
13589182,Mastery,Mrs C ,"1,183",34,5,"November 25, 2012","I read this with lots of reservation. After all, I've read so many self-help and enlightenment sort of books before, so what could be new in this one right?Well, there were plenty. It offers plenty of examples so it's more like a show than tell sort of approach, which I appreciated. There are a lot of nuggets in it that will allow the reader to reflect on the unifying theme of what Mastery is about. In my case, it was relevant because I have mastered (no pun intended) the jack-of-all trades concept where I flit to one hobby/skill to another, getting bored if I stay on to something for too long. This book showed me why focus and dedication is important to achieve true greatness. I liked this book a lot. ",24,1 comment
13589182,Mastery,ScienceOfSuccess,106,190,2,"July 4, 2019","Probably the best of Robert's books.The main problem I had with this ""masterpiece"" is that his writing style is repetitive.He starts a story, doesn't end it, then starts again and add something, and he does it with few stories over and over again.Honestly, if he would take his pills, he probably could sum up the whole book in 20 pages.This time I won't argue with research, assuming it was better, but he also took some ancient or unknown people and made them god's kind of. Cool read if u want to brag about reading ""non-fiction"" but honestly you won't learn much, and what you read is 50% authors personal fantasy mixed with 50% of historical facts.",21,1 comment
13589182,Mastery,Andy,"1,319",456,5,"May 13, 2019","""Mastery"" is unlike Greene's previous books, which were ""The Prince"" for modern times. This one seems almost to have been written by a different person. Instead of instructing the reader on how to achieve fleeting victory over other evil jackasses, now the author is trying to help you to do something meaningful for the world in the long-term. The quirky perspective yields content that is not in any of the standard books on management, leadership, psychology or wisdom. The audience here is the creative eccentric. Apart from the usual advice about focusing on your passion and all that, what Greene adds is brutally direct advice about what creative types need to do to cope with all the ""fools"" and ""sharks"" in the world. Among other things, it involves treating fools like furniture. I'm not sure that the advice is useful, but it does seem to be unique. Update--May, 2017: The perspectives from this book have turned out to be very useful on numerous occasions. For people striving for Mastery, it's like a Lonely Planet guide to an alien culture that makes no sense, except that the alien culture is the regular world all around us every day.",17,N/A
