11878168,Anything You Want,Hamad,970,1283,4,"November 16, 2020","This Review ‚úçÔ∏è Blog üìñ Twitter üê¶ Instagram üì∑This is a very short review because the book was short. The book has 40 lessons on entrepreneurship and these were unusual, out of the box lessons which I really enjoyed. Personally, I do enjoy reading non-fiction but I usually find the advice given in these books to be very logical. The beautiful thing about this book is that it was really unconventional. The lessons and the way the author speaks just captured my attention.The author tells his story with the CD baby company and the challenges and obstacles he had to face. I really thought that the author was lucky at many points but also smart so it was a perfect mix of both. I don‚Äôt think it gave me the answers to start a business but rather it provided some knowledge to maintain one. It was a short read anyway and I do recommend it for anyone interested in business and entrepreneur books!!",34,N/A
11878168,Anything You Want,D,407,8,4,"July 27, 2011","A couple of Derek Sivers stories:My first CD Baby order was #17697, for 8 discs, in 2000. When I got the now-famous colorful shipment notice I thought I‚Äôd actually been the first brand new customer to order as many as 8 albums. I thought the email had been crafted for me, in particular. I felt special.A little later, I placed an even bigger order, and it happened to be while CD Baby was moving across the country. It was delayed long enough that I eventually contacted support, and I promptly got a very nice and apologetic email from Derek Sivers himself (along with the discs, in short order). Again, I felt special.Later on I learned that everyone got the crazy shipment notice, even for ordering a single disc, and that at the time Derek emailed me, he was one of just two people in the CD Baby ‚Äúorganization.‚ÄùAnd for a little while I felt less special. But eventually I realized that a key part of CD Baby‚Äôs value proposition for customers ‚Äî artists and purchasers alike ‚Äî was making everyone feel special.Which, when you think about it, is no small trick.Reading Sivers‚Äô story of how and why he started, grew, and sold CD Baby, I was strongly reminded of interviews with Dischord‚Äôs Ian MacKaye. Partly because they say some of the same things, particularly about not having business growth as a goal. Both describe awkward conversations with ‚Äúsuits‚Äù who really can‚Äôt grasp this.But both also display an element of self-contradiction. Sivers says the money didn‚Äôt matter ‚Äî an easy thing to say when your life is not severely constrained by the lack of it ‚Äî but he did, after all, build a music store, not a music give-away service. Perhaps more tellingly, some of his biggest regrets are about decisions with significant cost impacts. And although Sivers repeatedly says that growth wasn‚Äôt a goal, but not only did he consistently make decisions that furthered growth, one of his most provocative epigrammatic guidelines is explicitly about facilitating growth. (It‚Äôs to try to make your business practices support double your current volume, which sounds very smart. If you, you know, want to grow the business.)These cavils aside, this is a pretty great book. Sivers is unusually candid about his mistakes as well as what he did right, and he‚Äôs lucid and entertaining. (He says he learned to prize clarity and brevity when crafting emails to CD Baby‚Äôs subscriber list, and demonstrates mastery of both here.) You‚Äôll probably be thinking about the contents of this brief book for much longer than the time it takes to read it.",30,N/A

I love to read his stuff.However, reading this book made me realize that he is more of a product of survivorship bias.This book was filled with two types of lessons: good business advice and then advice that happened to work for Derek Sivers.I couldn‚Äôt tell the two apart.",24,N/A
11878168,Anything You Want,Keshav Bhatt,92,78,5,"December 10, 2018","Awesome little book, I will keep re-reading. I love the opening pages - ""10 years of experience in 1 hour"". This book is written by Derek Sivers, who started a business called CDbaby that he later sold for $22 million. One of my favourite parts of the book was the graph at the beginning showing the monthly sales over 10 years of his business. In analysing it one thing I really appreciated was the steady but slow growth in the first 5 years of his business in particular. Reiterating once again the importance of steady applied effort & patience, whilst persistently improving. The key things I learned from this book (I read it twice over the course of 2 years) were: * Keep things simple. Implement a model and then persistently improve over and over again. * A reminder about the principle of being a hell yes or no to things - when you say no to things, you create room for the things you are a hell yes to. I've learned this to be true in many spaces of my life. To create a client who is a 10, you also need to be effective at repelling anyone who isn't. To do things you are a HELL YES to, you need to get really clear about your HELL NO. * ""No business plan survives first contact with customers"" Steve Blank. * Necessity is a great teacher* Everything in your business should be about your customers. Every choice you make, every decision as owner, every task you agenda, every meeting. Focus on that and things will grow. Just thrill them, and they will tell everyone. * I loved the story he told about quitting a job, feeling bad he was leaving so he trained & hired a replacement before he did, not knowing that that wasn't standard practice. ""Deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do"".* Never forget that someone else loves doing what you hate, you can make your role anything you want, you just need to remember why you do it - you do it to make you happy! (Derek talks a lot about the programming, and random tasks he did, just because he liked doing them. Yeah he could hire someone, or do it better, but he loved learning different things - and thats OK!!)* Execution is worth more than any idea. * Have lots of little clients instead of one big one. Definitely something I'm implementing right now in my social enterprise. * What you are doing is just ONE way of doing things. You want to test & try different ways, and not be stuck to one method. In business, there are different ways:- make a plan without any funding- make your whole business offline- make a franchise modelIn life, there are different ways:- You could be living in NY obsessed with making lots of money- You could be a free spirit backpacking around SE Asia- You could be a monk meditating in isolation in the mountains- You could be married living your family in a quiet neighbourhoodThere is no one way. Things change. Things work for different people at different times. Be open to change. Embrace and roll with it. * There's not always a need for a huge vision. You can focus on helping people today. Instead of thinking about ""if I had X.. I could do Y"". A trap I notice many people fall into* Add lots of fun human touches to your company. Everywhere. From the email auto-responder to the copy on your site, to your office layout. It's OK to be casual & human. Focus on what makes you happy and doing things in a way that makes you happy. * When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you control all the laws. This is your utopia. * There's lots of nudges towards keeping things simple, here's another - a business plan shouldn't take more than a few hours of work. Hopefully no more than a few minutes, the best plans are simple. A quick glance, and common sense should tell you if the numbers will work. Everything else is details. (edit: After 6 years in business, and going from a beginner, to trying to turn pro and master lots of details, I really understand this more on a different level now. You don't need to be too fancy or complicated.)* Never make promises you can't deliver on. Under promise & over deliver instead of the other way around.* Delegate or die. Trust but verify. Delegate but not abdicate* Once something works, it will feel freeing, not strenuous. Sivers mentions how he spent 12 years doing different things, it felt like it was uphill all the time (I can relate!) then suddenly it was like he struck a hit. Instead of trying to create demand, you're trying to manage the demand. Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not persistently doing what is not working. So you should always be trying, tweaking, testing new ideas instead of stubbornly pushing the same one again and again.",13,N/A

Even though it's short, Derek is totally right. The journey is often more important than the destination. For example, it's cool that I've read 100+ books a year. But it's the memories from reading & learning new things that I'll treasure most. Not the label of being a prolific reader.""Anything You Want"" is also a great insight into CDBaby, and how Derek grew it to one of the most recognizable businesses in the music industry.Five stars.",11,N/A
11878168,Anything You Want,Klinta,332,159,3,"July 22, 2018","Ok, so I read this because apparently everyone in web development has been raving about it and I am not really that blown away. I don't know why I had such a different experience from others, but most of the things said in this book just seemed common sense to me. I didn't feel like it is a very special wisdom he is sharing, he is just stating the obvious (at least for me). It might be to with the fact that I am currently listening to the Simon Sinek's book and a lot of ideas are really the same. Or it might do with the fact that I have never heard of his company and didn't have the emotional connection to it. Anyway, it was a nice and quick read and I think I might give it a re-read at some point, but I don't really feel like my ground has been shaken and I should change the way I live, work, care and believe.

Are you profitable? Isn‚Äôt that enough?‚ÄùA concise yet useful take on entrepreneurship from the founder of the original CD baby company. In other words, the birth of the company can be considered the stepping stone for the idea of iTunes as we mostly are aware of today. Whether it is the author‚Äôs main intention or not, the book offers quite a genuine and practical approach, instead of deliberately trying to sell business ideas to the readers.Overall, this is quite an interesting and approachable read.Actual rating: 3.7/5‚òÜ",6,N/A

11878168,Anything You Want,Rob Warner,223,3,5,"August 26, 2011","Quick read but insightful. The basic premise, as I understood it, is to spend your life doing things that bring you happiness, which is not as straightforward as it seems. Too often, we spend our time doing what we think will make us happy, or what we think others expect from us, or what society dictates that we do. This book isn't a formula for building a multi-million dollar company, although that's what CDBaby turned out to be. Instead, it helps you see what criteria to consider when making decisions about your life, your work, and your company. Inspirational.",5,N/A

11878168,Anything You Want,Adam Zerner,59,100,4,"May 19, 2017","Summary:- The goal is happiness, not money.- Be persistent in iterating, not in doing what doesn't work.- Just focus on making customers happy. Go above and beyond for them. If they're not begging you to let them pay you for the service, keep iterating until they are.- Don't worry about the business-y stuff - it's not that important.- Be real. Be genuine. Be a person.- Optimizing for lots of trivial metrics has bad unintended consequences. There's value in simplicity and genuineness.- You do have to delegate.- Don't be the small shop that is overwhelmed and can't handle lots of business. It signals that you're incompetent.- Be careful - don't make promises about things that are beyond your control (or else Steve Jobs is going to screw you!).- Don't sign away 90% of your company to your dad for $20,000! Or give your employees authority to set up profit sharing for themselves! These points may seem obvious. However, I think Derek does a really great job of telling stories that make them stick. And he does so without taking up twenty hours of your life.Some awesome stories:- A silly confirmation e-mail lead to tons of recommendations and free advertising.- A taxi driver in Vegas missed the days when the Mafia ran things. The Mafia just cared about the bottom line. Now the MBAs run things. They have all of these stupid metrics and charge an extra 25¬¢ for ketchup on a hot dog. That just takes the fun out of Vegas.- Why no advertising? ""That would be like putting a coke machine in a monastery."" (best analogy ever)- When he is unclear in an email to 20,000 customers, it costs him $5,000 in customer support. For other people, when they're unclear, the consequences are similar, but they aren't as visible. That's too bad, because it doesn't motivate them to correct mistakes.- If people want a favor, like updating an album cover (which takes 45 minutes), CD Baby asks the customer to buy them a pizza. This humanizing thing made customers love them.- Apple told Derek that they want to have every song in their iTunes store. Then they got pissed, went back on their word, ignored Derek, and cost him $400,000.Other notes:- The tone of the writing is pretty absolute. There isn't an explicit disclaimer of: ""This isn't always true. It doesn't apply to every situation. Actually, I'm not even sure if it's true at all, but it seems to work for me."" However, the disclaimer does apply, and it is stated in the first post: https://sivers.org/ayw1, so keep it in mind.- The core ideas and philosophies are very similar to DHH and Jason Fried at Basecamp.",4,N/A
