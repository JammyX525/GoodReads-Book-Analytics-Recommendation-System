99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,KVG,69,1289,2,"June 16, 2019","If you have read anything about the rise if design in business, ignore this book. I was assigned it for school and basically was able to skip the entire thing. I was disappointed my program assigned this.14 years ago, at publish time, this was ground breaking. Now: table stakes. TL;DR: creativity is an essential skill as it will be the last thing automated, and it is what drives breakthroughs.If you find this ^ intriguing or surprising, read the book. If not, skip to the “portfolio” chunks of section 2. There, Pink outlines different exercises broken down by concept: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, meaning. The ideas are worth trying.

99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Joanne,96,5,5,"January 23, 2011","I’m a “right-brainer”. In the language of Myers-Brigg’s typology, I am an extreme INFP, an introverted feeling type (heart vs. head), with strong leanings towards intuition (vs. sensing), and perceiving (vs. judgment). As an “intuitive”, I make all sorts of connections, linking ideas, and often jumping from one thought to another. Trying to keep up with me in conversation, people sometimes say that I am “all over the place.” This typology has not always served me well in my career, particularly since I spent most of it in the midst of “left-brain” engineers who are logical, analytical, and decisive. It often seemed we spoke different languages; and though I could understand theirs, they couldn’t understand mine. Consequently, in that environment, my contributions were often derided and dismissed as “warm and fuzzy” or “airy-fairy.” Well, finally there is a respectful name for the all-over-the-place way I think. I am a ""Cultural Creative"". Thank you, Daniel H. Pink! And, not only is there a place in today’s advanced world for the way my mind works; according to Pink, there is a need for more of it! In his book, A Whole New Mind, Pink tells of a shift from the “left-brain” thinking of the “Information Age”, to a future that belongs to those of us with a very different kind of mind: creators and empathizers, pattern recognizers, and meaning makers, artists, inventors, designers, storytellers, caregivers, consolers, and big picture thinkers. Of course that does not mean there is no further use for the skills or capabilities of the “left brain”. Rather, Pink says, “…the defining skills of the previous era – the “left brain” capabilities that powered the Information age – are necessary but no longer sufficient. And the capabilities we once disdained or thought frivolous – the “right-brain” qualities of inventiveness, empathy, joyfulness, and meaning – increasingly will determine who flourishes and who flounders. For individuals, families, and organizations, professional success and personal fulfillment no require a whole new mind.” (p. 3)The rules have changed, says Pink. A master of fine arts, an MFA, is the new MBA. As evidence, he cites Robert Lutz, the man hired by General Motors to help turn around the ailing automaker. Asked by the New York Times how his approach would differ from what had been done before, Lutz replied, “It’s more right brain…I see us being in the art business. Art, entertainment and mobile sculpture, which, coincidentally, also happens to provide transportation.” Pink outlines what he asserts are the six essential aptitudes – “the six senses” – which will guide our lives, shape our world, and on which professional success and personal satisfaction will increasingly depend: 1. Not just function but also DESIGN. “Today It’s economically crucial and personally rewarding to create something that is also beautiful, whimsical, or emotionally engaging.”2. Not just argument but also STORY. “The essence of persuasion, communication, and self-understanding has become the ability also to fashion a compelling narrative.”3. Not just focus but also SYMPHONY. “What’s in greatest demand today isn’t analysis but synthesis – seeing the big picture, crossing boundaries, and being able to combine disparate pieces into an arresting new whole.”4. Not just logic but also EMPATHY. “What will distinguish those who thrive will be their ability to understand what makes their fellow woman or man tick, to forge relationships, and to care for others.”5. Not just seriousness but also PLAY. “(T)oo much sobriety can be bad for your career and worse for your general well-being. In the Conceptual Age, in work and in life, we all need to play.”6. Not just accumulation but also MEANING. Living in a world of “breathtaking material plenty…has freed hundreds of millions of people from day-to-day struggles and liberated us to pursue more significant desires: purpose, transcendence, and spiritual fulfillment.”Pink provides plenty of evidence of this shift – persuasive even to those who are L-Directed - as it is manifesting throughout our economy and our society. He then spends much of the remainder of the book exploring how to develop these six essential aptitudes, with a Portfolio for each, rich with tools and resources. In fact, this is a book written to appeal to both L-Directed and R-Directed readers. It is well researched, but very readable, incorporating all six of these essential aptitudes. It is chock full of examples, anecdotes, and humour. And it is well edited (designed), and illustrated, with lots of experiential tidbits and options for further action.Well, I abandoned the world of engineers some years ago and, since then, have been very much following my own natural inclinations, which also happen to be my bliss! So you can imagine my delight in reading Pink’s book, to discover that where I am right now is exactly where I should be. At last, my time has come! To see what I mean, explore my website at http://www.c-change.info So, can we help you to develop your six senses?",48,7
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Kelly,251,29,3,"July 9, 2008","Daniel Pink’s A Whole New Mind makes many excellent points. Unfortunately, it suffers from an awkward and unconvincing metaphorical framework.Chapter 1: Right Brain RisingPink starts out explaining about the brain’s left and right hemispheres, and how each side is responsible for different cognitive activities - the left hemisphere tends to be responsible for sequential logic, analysis, and language; the right hemisphere for holistic reasoning, pattern recognition, emotions and body language. So far, so good. Pink is careful to point out, over and over again, that the terms “left-brained” and “right-brained” are misnomers; that you need both hemispheres to be completely functional, and that they certainly don’t work independently of each other. He emphasizes (again and again) that “left-brained” and “right-brained” are “powerful metaphor[s] for how individuals and organizations navigate their lives.” That’s all well and good, but in the rest of the book the “left-brained” functions or “L-Directed thinking” end up left in the dust. It says right on the cover “Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future” — a claim made nowhere in the book. That just screams “GIMMICK!” to me. Will people with “whole minds” rule the future, or people who are right-brained? If the title can’t get it’s story straight, I don’t have much faith in the entire book.Chapter 2: Abundance, Asia, and AutomationI suppose alliteration is an R-Directed thing. This chapter talks about the many choices and options that American consumers are faced with, overseas outsourcing, and technology, and how these three things have either eliminated a lot of jobs and significantly raised the bar on others. The “abundance” and “automation” sections are quite good, but he drops the ball on Asia. He doesn’t discuss global economics at all, and one almost gets the sense that India is some sort of economic enemy to battle against. I don’t think he meant it that way, but it was irritating. Pink doesn’t address why what he thinks of as R-Directed jobs are going to be safe against India while L-Directed jobs are threatened. I heard a story on NPR not long ago about how localized, creative advertising campaigns are starting to be outsourced — complete with local culture training. Unless global inequities are addressed, jobs are going to continue to trickle downward to the cheapest labor.Chapter 3: High Concept, High Touch This chapter talks about the demand for “knowledge workers” diminishing and the demand for “creators and empathizers” growing, and about how MFA programs are harder to get into than MBA programs. I think this is more reflective of a glut of MBA programs and applicants than anything else – something called supply and demand, perhaps, or is that too L-Directed?Part Two Part Two discusses what Pink calls “The Six Senses” which … whatever. They’re more “sensibilities” than “senses,” but I’ll go along with the clumsy neuroscience metaphor. Getting past that, Pink actually makes a great case for “design,” “story,” “symphony,” “empathy,” and “play” that I wish Slightly Evil, LLP would be receptive to. (It won’t.) Each chapter comes with a “Portfolio” section that includes lots of resources and exercises for improving your skills in each area. None of these “senses” seem to be things that people in India can’t handle, though.Chapter Nine, the final “sense,” is meaning. As an atheist and an empiricist, I consider “meaning” exceptionally important to my life since I believe we must create it for ourselves, and not rely on some One else to bestow it upon us. Pink’s “meaning” seems to be a vague, feel-good mix between “happiness” and “spirituality” and dizziness. It was a bad way to end a book that had just started to pick up a little.Overall…First of all, this book is aimed exclusively at middle-class white collar workers. It is certainly not a comprehensive look at the “new” American economy.Secondly, I didn’t learn anything new from this book. Pink relies heavily on anecdotes and less on L-Directed… facts. The book doesn’t say anything that my father didn’t tell me when he sat down with me and gave me the “what you should be when you grow up” speech. He told me that “The people who make the most money are not the people who know how to do stuff. They are the ones who know how to tell those people what to do.” (I was ten, he had to dumb it down a little.) I think that’s how I ended up in this L/R crossover career called information design.In summation, what Pink calls having “a whole mind” is what I learned was called “being intelligent.” And I really wish that Steven Johnson had written this book instead.",33,3
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Trevor,"1,279",21300,2,"August 11, 2010","After enjoying Drive this book was surprisingly disappointing. The basic line is that if you are doing something that can be done by computers or more cheaply by Asian workers then your job probably doesn’t have a future. You are probably doing something much too ‘left-brained’ and you need to start doing something more ‘right-brained’. This guy really does like to categorise ideas – he has six main categories in this one that you need to be good at if you are going to make it in the new world order: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning. Symphony is the only non-obvious one, and he actually means synthesis (bringing all the bits together). Along the way he discusses various books (some, like Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain I can highly recommend). He also recommends some very iffy practices – the laughing yoga movement (honestly) and Emotional Intelligence (spare me) – that really do make you cringe with embarrassment for the author at times.But, that said, he does recommend a couple of books in this that I have now ordered. One is called How to Read Superhero Comics and Why – which sounds fascinating – and the other is called Story – which I’m hoping to start soon.Overall, though, this was disappointing. Far too much ‘pop’ in the ‘pop psychology’ for my tastes.",22,23
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Ashok Rao,66,33,5,"April 22, 2019","This is a very important book and I strongly recommend it. If you are a teacher you can recommend it your students and as a parent you can gift it to your children. Daniel H. Pink not just talks about ""why"" but he gives equal importance to ""how"" too. In short why right-brainers will rule the future and how to engage the right hemisphere. This book is full of exercises and resources and you would immediately want to start exercising your right hand side of the brain.",11,2
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Elliott,1,1 follower,5,"June 18, 2011","This book was better than what reviewers and critics were saying about it.Daniel makes it completely clear that to survive in the conceptual age, we need to harness the power of our right brained cognitive abilities. In concordance, left brained cognitive abilities have simply grown obsolete, completely vulnerable to the affects/threats of the conceptual age, because their working function can now be either be automated, shipped off to foreign grounds (due to globalization), or be terminated because of affluence and abundance. Left brained dominant people would just have to simply go through more obstacles to survive and thrive in the conceptual age. Daniel had showed that it would be right-brained people who would have a better chance of overcoming the obstacles the conceptual age has to offer, having advantages over growing-obsolete left-brained dominant people. Daniel had made it clear that right-brained people would rule the future, but dominantly in the middle class workforce. He proves that right-brained people are now more profitable to companies because of their creative and simultaneous qualities. ALTHOUGH he shows that it is the WHOLE MINDED people that would triumph above all in any aspect of the conceptual age. He points out that the high touch, high concept aptitudes are what you need to harness the right-brained cognitive abilities as well as strengthen the relationship between the left and right brains, for it is through these aptitudes that the left-brain misinterprets and the right-brain comes to rescue and saves the day. A whole new mind- why right-brainers will rule the future is a MUST READ. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE who wants to survive in the business world and for any field in the conceptual age for that matter. ",9,N/A
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Joel,409,22,4,"August 4, 2007","Pink's proposal is a touch idealistic, but the vision he paints is promising. Basically, since automation and outsourcing to Asia can now accomplish lots of left-brain heavy jobs (computer coding, etc.) and since affordability of so many products has freed up some of our time and energy, Pink suggests that future jobs (and happiness) will depend more on those who master six critical senses managed by the right side (the creative side) of the brain: design, play, story, symphony, empathy, and meaning. As a teacher, I really like Pink's ideas and can use them to better influence the ways (and even what) I teach. But I think it'll be a while before the world shifts the way he suggests.It's a quick read, however, as Pink's style takes complex psychological and scientific proposals and makes them palatable and easy to understand. Worth checking out.",7,1 comment
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Sally Linford,65,5,5,"June 6, 2008","Although it goes against my principles to give 5 stars to a self-help book, I make an exception for this gem. It's fascinating and revealing, and full of hope for the future (there's a rare commodity). My book club really loved it--all of us.Pink (yes, that's his name) outlines his vision for the next generation of world business trends in our ""flat"" world where automation, asia, and abundance have created new requirements for success--requirements that for the most part come out of the right brain. The writing is very good, fun, pleasant reading. Lots of metaphors--very atypical business book. He includes delightful exercises for working your right-brain at the end of each section of his right-brain portfolio (Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, Meaning). The book is full of fascinating research tidbits like: * The most effective corp leaders make their subordinates laugh 3 times more often than their managerial counterparts.* Self-made millionaires are 4 times more likely to have dyslexia than the general population.I esp. loved this quote from Sidney Harman, eighysomething multimillionaire CEO fo a stereo components company who claims, ""Instead of hiring MBAs, get me some poets as managers. Poets are our original systems thinkers. . . those unheralded systems thinkers, are our true digital thinkers. It is from their midst that I believe we will draw tomorrow's new business leaders.""________________This is the ""Responsible Women"" book choice for the month. Technically, I suppose it would be categorized as a business book, but it's very right-brained (of course), with a respectful nod to the left-brain also. So far I love it. I'll rate it when I'm finished. (still have another week).",5,N/A
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Rick,778,2,3,"January 10, 2008","Besides having an author name seemingly borrowed from “Reservoir Dogs,” there is much to like in this popular business/pop psychology book. It posits a movement from an era when “Left-Brained” Knowledge Work was at a premium to one in which “Right-Brained High-Concept and High Touch” Work will be the demand opportunity. Computers and a global workforce have reduced the at home demand for knowledge work—computers do it massively faster and smart, English-speaking workers in West Asia and Africa do it massively cheaper. That work, Pink insists, is replaceable both qualitatively and quantitatively. What’s not is making sense of knowledge in new contexts and connecting with people. Our society does much to develop knowledge skills (logic, reasoning, computation, organization) but little to promote the so-called right-brained skills. To correct that Pink suggests that we focus on six senses of high-concept, high touch: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play, and Meaning. The book is clear, written with a light, serviceable prose, and mercifully brief. Unlike Thomas Friedman he doesn’t take a relatively simple case, overload it with jargon, self-conscious phrase making, and endless examples that repeat each other, rather than develop depth and nuance. If The World Is Flat is the Titanic, A Whole New Mind is a life raft of observational, big picture thinking. The only false note in the book is in his section on Meaning where he praises spirituality but then qualifies it by saying anyone who refuses medical treatment for prayer deserves what follows. It is a rather mean spirited and gratuitous way to balance a point, and one that follows directly on the chapter on empathy. Oops.",5,N/A
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Natsu,31,2,2,"October 6, 2020","Daniel Pink’s argument is very simple; the dynamics of the corporate world are gradually changing, and soon enough, a large number of left-brain dominant workers will face the risk of losing their jobs because 1) workers with cheaper wages will take over, and 2) computers will be chosen over humans since they get things done faster; therefore, what we can do to adapt to this social transition is to put our right hemisphere of the brain into action. Essential abilities needed to activate the right side of the brain are broken down into six categories; design, story symphony, empathy, play, meaning, and Pink explains in detail what can be done to hone each of these skills. My takeaway was the list of books and websites he compiled. I found a couple of interesting books that I would like to add to my ever-growing TBR pile. One tiny glitch; judging from the cover artwork and the title, I thought the book was written by a neuroscientist. I was looking forward to reading a scientific story of the brain, which did not happen. A mild disappointment but a mistake on my part.",5,N/A
99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Steven,20,1 follower,2,"February 17, 2009"," I was disappointed with this book. I must confess I did not finish it. I'm writing a review for the first 60%. I did learn some things. It has been a while since my psychology classes and I enjoyed the brain review. However, it degrades into a cheerleading book without much support. I lost interest at the point where he talks about the CEO who hires poets instead of MBA holders. I need a bit more support to the argument than I asked some rich guy. Are there any studies comparing the success rate of Team Poet vs. Team MBA? Any reviews by the employees who work for each? Another problem with this book is that it asserts that creative thinkers are the new skilled labor because engineering jobs are all moving to India to be done for less. If you are a left-brainer, you're as boring as a toaster, as unique as a popsicle stick. As I've said in other reviews, this hackneyed theme of worthless, overpaid American engineers may play into people's fears and sell books, but it's only a short-term phenomenon at best. To the extent that outsourcing is a threat, it is a threat to all professions. Does anyone believe Asia lacks artists?",4,1 comment

Most of the evidence offered is anecdotal. When the author does us the (occasional) service of providing a reference, it is usually a weak source, a secondary source, or a source completely unrelated to the fact/quote stated.

Sorry Mr. Pink. The stories were fun to read, the numbers and data were interesting.. but couldn't buy your prophecy and share u your ""pinkish"" view of the future.I believe our world is already run by a few R-Directed minds.. crazy ones indeed.

99315,A Whole New Mind Why RightBrainers Will Rule the Future,Lauren Deland,21,4,3,"April 22, 2009","If you are already the type to work through your ideas by sketching, dreaming, and creating, this book isn't likely to tell you anything you don't already know. You may, however, come away feeling a little smug towards the persistent chorus of voices that cast doubts on the aspirations of those drawn towards the arts and liberal arts studies.  That is, until you realize that Pink's assertion that ""right-brainers will rule the future"" isn't really substantiated in this book. Pink begins the book with the assertion that the outsourcing of jobs to developing countries is an inevitable symptom of globalization that we simply need to get used to. Shrugging off all questions about the ethics of outsourcing, Pink suggests that the abundance of life in the U.S. (paradoxically coupled with waves of job losses in the technical sector,) will place a premium on jobs that require ""empathy"" and other forms of fundamentally human understanding. Yet while I hold both a BFA and an MA, I'm not popping the champagne yet, because Pink fails to provide adequate evidence, or even a convincing projection of what a new creative class of U.S. workers may look like. This is where the ""right-brained"" premise of the book collides with the more practical problems of implementing such jobs: for instance, Pink predicts the (wholly predictable) increase in need for nurses (purveyors of empathetic, ""care work"") as the Baby Boomers age, but is altogether unconcerned about how spiraling costs in health care could impede this progress.  I would be interested to hear Pink review some of his arguments in lieu of the recent economic downturn-- how might his theories be affected by the new convictions held by many Americans, that we are not quite so affluent as we thought? Moreover, what of the fact that the queasy corporate ethics that Pink ignores are in large part responsible for this crisis? I confess that I cringed when I read Pink's praise of Ford's investment in ""artistic-minded"" administrators, and when he recited a list of financial service firms that had tasked out their accounting to India: Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase. Sound familiar?",3,2
