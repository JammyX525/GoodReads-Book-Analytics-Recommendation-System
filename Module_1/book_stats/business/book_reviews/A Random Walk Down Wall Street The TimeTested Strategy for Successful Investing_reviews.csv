40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Jack,3,10,1,"April 15, 2012","Many years ago I bought this book about the stock market. In retrospect, it is the worst book I've ever bought because it made me believe in efficient capital markets. The author made his point with a lot of arrogance - just like finance professors did 15-20 years ago. At the time the markets very certainly not as efficient as the author believed. There have been several updates to the book, but the condescending voice of the author remains.For the statistically interested, the problem with a lot of old finance (and also not so old) research was that it was testing the theory that the market was efficient. That is poor philosophy of science. You should always test the opposite of what your theory stipulates. If you can reject the opposite, your theory is as supported as it can be (standard Popper). The finance profession in their ignorance of philosophy of science tested it the other way around. This means that they could too easily conclude that the markets were efficient. Not a word about such complications in this book. Why is this relevant? I would say that the author is less critical of research that supports his preconceived opinion.I did not realise this bias when I first read the book. Instead, I believed the author's conclusion that the markets must be so efficient that it is fruitless to try to beat them. That was and is just plain silly. The markets are of course tending towards efficiency, so it is not easy to beat them. This is an important point. However, to state that they are efficient is just plain arrogant. So while there are some very good critical analyses in this book, ultimately it might make you believe in something that is very costly: That you cannot make more money in the stock market unless you are willing to take on a higher level of risk.Currently a lot of academics are questioning the efficient markets. This research is not taken seriously by the author. I am reminded of Kuhn's comment that the new paradigm only becomes prominent when the old guard dies/retires. Furthermore, a lot of people with a PhD in finance start hedge funds to exploit anomalies in the market place instead of writing academic articles. Wouldn't this be worth serious consideration by the author? Still, there is still room for other inefficiencies. For instance the role of emotions is totally disregarded by academic-finance number-crunchers.The author also has advice of how to invest. His view is to buy low-cost mutual funds. This is not awful advice, but still why would you buy mutual funds when the average fund doesn't even return average market returns? The only thing you know is that they take 1-3% in management fees every year. Do compound interest on that! In The Financial Times, the author recently argued that stocks in emerging markets are undervalued. It is hard to believe in efficient markets and write an investment column. So he just assumes (contrary to his book) that the markets are inefficient and have not priced those stocks correctly. Check out recent videos from 2011. He says that he believes in efficient markets when it comes to publicly available information. Then he proceeds to state that people in 1999 bought the wrong kind of stocks (Internet, technology), which were overvalued. Yes, I would agree those stocks were in a bubble. But honestly, then you cannot believe in efficient markets. These blaring inconsistencies are remarkable.If you have read this far and want to give me negative feedback, be my guest. I posted a version of this review on an earlier edition of the book, and the review got trashed be believers. When you get a lot of negative feedback on a negative review on amazon that tells you the author has a lot of worshippers. That should make you worried.A more rational response would be to read Justin Fox's The Myth of the Rational Market. It tells a much more nuanced narrative about the efficiency of capital markets and prominent academics role in developing ideas and theories. The style of the book is not preachy at all. His stories show academic finance to be a very dogmatic environment in the 80s and 90s. You could be called a communist by the stars in the field and have your chances of employment reduced if you didn't sign up to the belief that markets are efficient. It is all described in Fox's book. Or read Shiller's Irrational Exuberance describing how bubbles have been removed from finance textbooks and PhD syllabi because they doesn't fit with the rational actor model. He has the following to say about the efficient market hypothesis: ""one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought"". Or read Montier's Behavioural Investing: A Practitioners Guide to Applying Behavioural Finance (The Wiley Finance Series) (or his other books) for more evidence of imperfect markets. Or read Dreman's column in Forbes magazine.",205,25

40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Todd N,334,231,5,"January 21, 2008","From talking to friends and reading an internal financial mailing list at work I got the vague impression that this book was somehow too esoteric or controversial to bother with. I am very glad that I decided to read this book.It's hard to work in Silicon Valley without being affected by Wall Street. When I started working I was interested in technology, not business and finance. Business and finance seemed a bit beneath me. (Actually, technology seemed a bit beneath me too. I was kind of a snot in my twenties. But learning technology was directly related to my income, which forced me to pay enough attention to it to become interested.)Eventually I got to a point where I had to deal with stock options, employee stock purchase programs, lock out periods, etc. My approach to learning about this was similar to my approach to learning about technology: trial and error. Sadly this was an expensive way to learn. (One example: It cost me about $30,000 to learn the different between a market order and a limit order when selling some VRTY shares.) I have learned some definite lessons about how the stock market works, but at the cost of more money than I thought I would ever have -- let alone lose.That's why I would recommend this book to anyone who is planning to retire one day (i.e. everyone), especially people in their twenties with a vaguely technical bent. There is enough math and logic to make it interesting combined with enough plain prose and logical advice to make it important reading.If you aren't going to read it, I will summarize it here: save early and regularly, put the savings in index funds, try not to die. You can safely take out 4.5% of principal, so work backwards from that to figure out how and when to retire.",23,1 comment
40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,C,"1,075",1052,3,"June 13, 2011","Investors are bound to have heard about this classic and it’s author, economist Burton Malkiel. In this book, he explains that the market is highly efficient, and no one can accurately predict its ups and downs; it’s a “random walk”. So, the best approach is passive, “buy and hold” investing using diversified index funds held long term. I recommend this book to investors of any level, especially those attracted to active, speculative investing.The book begins with a fairly boring recount of several financial bubbles throughout history, to prove the “irrational exuberance” of investors. Malkiel shows that despite short-term trends, the market always corrects itself; “value will out”, as he puts it. Crazed investors rush into “revolutionary” new companies and technologies, but the key to investing is not how much an industry will affect society or how fast it will grow, but its ability to sustain profits. In truth, most IPOs underperform.Several investing techniques and theories are evaluated, including technical analysis, fundamental analysis, firm foundation theory, the “castle in the air” theory, efficient market theory, and modern portfolio theory. Malkiel uses the efficient market theory to explain the markets’ efficiencies, and modern portfolio theory in advising how to construct a diversified portfolio.Malkiel makes a compelling case that active investing is a losing game. Active investors generally underperform passive investors because they fail to time their purchases and sales correctly, and they incur transaction fees and taxes on their short term gains. Only 1/3 of active investors (individual traders and fund managers) beat the S&P 500 in the short term, and almost none beat it over the long term. In this section and throughout the book, Malkiel often refers to John Bogle, champion of indexing and founder of the Vanguard Group. I’m something of a Bogle disciple, and highly recommend his book The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.After providing a lot of background information, Malkiel finally gets to the part I was looking for: specific financial advice. He explains asset allocation and diversification, and how to build a portfolio based on your age and risk tolerance. I was hoping for example portfolios showing asset allocations for various age ranges, but Malkiel shies away from such detailed recommendations. For people in their 20s, like me, he suggests investing aggressively in stocks, including international and emerging markets. See my notes below for more of his advice.One of the main themes is the relationship between risk and reward. Malkiel puts it this way: you must decide whether you’d rather eat well or sleep well. Higher risk is more likely to yield higher returns, allowing you to eat well, but the stress may cost you your sleep. Only you know the risk you’re willing to take for the potential reward.The book ends with an explanation of hedging with derivatives such as futures, put options, and call options. I didn’t pay much attention, and plan to stick with his simpler advice on diversified indexing.NotesIgnore short term volatility; buy and hold for the long term.It’s financially wise to own your home. It’s an inflation hedge, provides tax breaks, and forces saving.The market trends upward, so it’s better to invest a lump sum today than to dollar cost average. For investors without lump sums, however, dollar cost averaging is the most common and reasonable approach.Save for financial goals using vehicles that mature at the goal date (CDs, treasuries, bonds, etc.).Portfolio constructionDiversify to reduce risk. Choose assets with low or no correlation. Include US stocks, international stocks, emerging market stocks, REITs, bonds, TIPs, and cash.Hold bonds and bond funds in tax sheltered accounts.Small cap stocks tend to outperform large cap. This may be due to higher risk, or survivorship bias.Value stocks tend to outperform growth, because investors tend to overpay for growth.REITs add diversity and have returns similar to stocks. They also provide an inflation hedge.Selecting fundsChoose no load, total stock market index funds.If you buy active funds, choose no load, low turnover, low expense funds with little unrealized appreciation.Look for expense ratios less than 0.5% and turnover less than 50%.",16,2
40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Sue,250,33,4,"November 10, 2016","We live in an age when most people have to control their own retirement destiny by making decisions about 401(k), 403(b), and IRAs. Even people with the most modest incomes are encouraged to confront that reality.Malkiel’s approach is excellent for most of us who are not into stock analysis. He gets high marks for a couple of things: (1) He proposed a market index fund before such a thing even existed. (2) He has revised his book eleven times. In other words he has some street cred. Wall Street cred. I read this because Jack Bogle (of Vanguard fame) recommends it as the best book to read on the subject of investment. And the real point of reading it – I wanted to see what Malkiel’s update had to say about my retirement funds in the current economic environment. At times I wondered who Malkiel was directing the book at. Some of his advice is remarkably simplistic, the kind of advice only a newbie would need. (Buy a house. Keep cash in an emergency fund.) But then section three is wonky, and he could not resist digging into the research that informs his decisions. For two-thirds of the book, I found this dichotomy annoying. Economists may like section three, but they won’t much care about section four, when the hand-holding begins.You may or may not care about the arguments over “efficient markets.” Malkiel is generally a believer but acknowledges dissenting views. Read it or not. If you’re here because you are looking for a rationale for a portfolio – one you can manage yourself – hang in there and read on.Essentially, his advice is classic for our times: build a diversified portfolio of index funds (some small caps, large caps, international, emerging economies, REITs, and bonds). If possible, start early and keep as much as you can in tax-sheltered accounts. He does not recommend buying a stock index fund and nothing else. The comments on diversifying are important.Not a radical approach. He does feel that in the middle of this decade we live in an environment that is not likely to offer large returns. So his asset allocation recommendations are the meat of his 2015 advice. Many readers may want to zoom right in on those later chapters. He has comments on the amount of risk appropriate to various situations.You won’t get rich quick following his advice, but you probably knew that. But you’ll probably face retirement with a tidy sum and a stable financial life. ",11,N/A

40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Poorna Kumar,24,6,5,"June 12, 2022","Why didn't I read this earlier? Essential reading. If you're a personal finance novice like me, skip all the noisy books and influencers on investing and just read this. It has a higher signal-to-noise ratio because Malkiel knows his stuff. He doesn't overcomplicate things, but the substance is there. And this book is, miraculously, fun to read because of his sense of humor.One thing to note -- while Malkiel doesn't overcomplicate things, there are both simple takeaways and nuanced ones. Chapters will sometimes start with a theory and some evidence to support it, then more evidence to refute it. If that's not your cup of tea, then maybe seek out a simpler text with the same overarching conclusion. But reality is not simple, and although I'm a novice, I like learning things at a slightly deeper level, getting a glimpse of the caveats and complexities -- if only because it shores up my confidence in the simple takeaways of the book (roughly ""don't try to beat the market, except for fun/with lower stakes, and even then, don't expect to win but here are some strategies that could help, YMMV""). I can't say I was always able to reconcile or make sense of the detailed evidence presented, but the simple takeaways were always very clear and I feel more confident in my investments now.He's pretty old now so I'm not sure if he'll publish another edition, but I'd have loved to read a version of this published after 2021 - I'm sure he has a view on the extraordinary market circumstances over the past two years.",9,N/A

40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Scott,207,50,5,"April 2, 2009","Malkiel's been writing and rewriting this classic tome on investing for the last thirty-five years. I gave him 5 stars for being fully engaged in the process of revision. Sometimes I wish all authors would write (and rewrite) just one good book (and that actors would star in only one movie). But that's like asking investors to put their money in just a few low-cost funds and hold it there for decades ... hey, that's what Malkiel's talking about! So it's not the most exciting approach to investing; but it will, in the long run, turn out to be the most rewarding.This newly rewritten version of Malkiel's classic Random Walk ... (first published in 1973 but essentially rewritten at least four or five times since) argues that the best way to make money on Wall Street is to build a diversified portfolio of index funds (some small caps, large caps, emerging economies, REITs, and bonds) and hold on to them for a long, long time in a tax advantaged account. He advises you how to adjust your asset allocation according to your age or point in life, and he even allows you to pick a few stocks for minor investments just for fun and to help you stay interested in the market.Preliminary chapters recount bubbles past (where would historical economics be without 17th-century Holland's fascination with tulips?). The middle sections debunk dubious investment strategies based in everything from hemlines to super bowls and stresses the importance of sheer, random luck in choosing profitable stocks. Part Three looks at modern investment theories (if you don't have a background in economics, you might want to skim some of this part). The final section details Malkiel's guide to personal finance and investing.If you are curious about how men and women have invested their money over the past 500 years, or how common investment strategies work (and don't work in the long run), or how to make the most of your investments over decades, Malkiel's Random Walk ... will prove to be an engaging, even entertaining read that like most classics can hold up to many re-readings. You certainly won't get rich quick following Malkiel's advice, but you probably will find yourself in a fairly stable financial state in twenty or thirty years.",5,4
40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Vincent Li,205,1 follower,3,"January 28, 2016","A pretty good read for what it's worth. A good primer into basic finance. Personally, it was a good review of finance 101, with a pretty solid explanation of modern portfolio theory, and CAPM. Book seems timely, updated to include a large section on speculative bubbles, and even includes a chapter on behavioral economics. Includes a brief section on the 2008 financial crisis (kind of the standard narrative). It discusses the two competing views of stock prices, which is basically the fundamentalist discount model and technicalist beauty contest. Surprisingly, the review of the literature was quite broad, going from historical economists debating over tulip mania to Fama's work on beta (that beta against the S&P 500 is predictive of returns). Personally, I thought the most interesting thing was the discussion of Fama-French factors (beta, small firms, value) and the idea of seeing P/E ratios as a certain premium. The book is famous for introducing efficient market theory (strong, semi-strong and weak forms) to the general public. It argues through some pretty copious evidence that it is hard to beat the market consistently either through fundamentals or technicals. Malkiel shows how the market has outperformed in the long run even professionals, and so advises buying and holding a broadly diversified index as the main component of a portfolio. The book argues that the fees taken by active managers, along with transaction costs and taxes wipe out any extra return if there is any. Filled with practical advice (life cycle investing, holding more bonds to stocks as you get older), and the standard lessons of finance. A quick and easy read, recommended for beginners or to refresh one's memory.",5,N/A
40242274,A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful Investing,Martin,39,2,5,"May 30, 2019",An absolutely amazing book going through the essentials of investing and the financial market. There is so much useful information digested for the common folk which I have been looking for in various other titles without success. The author occasionally exaggerates and gives extreme examples to put emphasis on his points which can be a bit annoying at times. I also regret reading a quite old version of the book which has been published right before the economic crisis of 2008. I would say its a must read for anyone interested in investing and would especially recommend it to beginners like myself.,5,N/A
