38743564,Billion Dollar Whale The Man Who Fooled Wall Street Hollywood and the World,Syahira ,650,72,5,"September 22, 2018","Being a Malaysian and trying to come up with a perfectly objective review is impossible when it hit so close to home. Nothing against to the wonderful people who contributed to this publication. But there has never have been a book that filled me with so much rage and disgust. Therefore, I shall not self-censor myself to the barrage of insults that I shall unleash. Because at this moment, I am too sober and too angry to be nice.Billion Dollar Whale is a very readable and well-written condensation of the decade long kleptocratic 1Malaysia Development Berhad scam that centered around one pathetic greedy moron called Jho Low. The spoiled cowardly manchild who came from a moderately rich family of Penang who dreamed of fame and luxury. By sheer luck and his connections to those of wealth and fortune, he became a self-made crazy rich Asian billionaire. Of course, none of it would have happened if Mr Low hadn't surround himself with his enablers from middle eastern princes to bankers to Hollywood A-listers to politicians who got suck into this web of lies and ill-begotten wealth that was funded by and debt paid by us millions of Malaysian taxpayers.Sadly, there will be people who look up to Jho Low. Who see him as a genius mastermind who duped everyone for a grand short-lived adventure. There might be movie being made from this because why not? People showering in Cristal champagne. Famous paintings and acquisitions. Shopping sprees. Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Alicia Keys, Miranda Kerr, Kimora Lee Simmons, Nicole Scherzinger, Busta Rhymes and of course, Leonardo DiCaprio. Dumb dumb people being seduced by easy money but who am I to blame them. Me, someone who only shared the same nationality of the person who fooled them all.It was painfully hard trying not to become numb after seeing countless of millions and billions dollars being thrown about. The massive scale and downright ridiculous and thoughtless inhumanity of it all. How massive amount of money being dropped and nobody even thought to wonder where they came from. Ringgit being depreciated so suddenly. Years of us being shackled by massive debt incurred. And for what? For paid affection of actors and supermodels? For some pink diamonds and tasteless Birkins? For the respect earned through dirty money borrowed from people duped left and right? ""Guilt-by-lifestyle""? What bloody hypocrites them all! And sheer irresponsibility of it all that unwittingly fell on us, millions of voting citizen to turn the tide just to put a crack on it. It's not simply about money. There are people who have been unjustifiably persecuted, missing and dead because of this scandal. The unimaginable horror of what would happen if we let this charade continue further.I hope the future will unravel more of the rot. I hope the hammer of justice will pull the biggest wallop. What goes around comes around.",313,17

If you are interested in the manipulations of high finance, the greed of Wall Street investment banks, how money is hidden and manipulated in offshore accounts, this is your story. If you pay attention to government corruption and malfeasance, you’ll be hard put to find a more egregious case. If you are into over the top, unbelievable parties, pick up this book. If you like to follow the celebrities, the Hollywood set, they are here: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jamie Fox, Paris Hilton and many, many more. And this story isn’t over. Many involved have been caught, others have slid by, some are in hiding and undoubtedly still pulling strings.Our perpetrator, Jho Low, is a rather unremarkable looking Malaysian of Chinese ethnicity, born into a family of moderate wealth. His businessman father invests in him sending him to the Harrow School in England where he can rub shoulders with children of the wealthy from around the world. From there he studies at Wharton in the U.S., where he hangs out mostly with the international set making more contacts with children of influential parents. Ensnaring the influential becomes his modus operandi as his all-consuming desire for wealth and status, the brazenness of his schemes, the craftiness of his methods, his ability to find and cultivate relationships with co-conspirators who control huge amounts of money, make him one of the most remarkable criminals of our time. I won’t spoil this book by getting into details, but the aftermath continues. Just today (2/24/2020) Reuters ran an article regarding the financial fallout as Malaysia seeks $7.5 billion in reparations from Goldman Sachs. The author Tom Wright just tweeted about the Thai government’s protection of Jho Low which is causing considerable consternation in that country. He has been reported to be hiding out in China now. The book left me with a queasy feeling about how master manipulators like Jho Low can so easily subvert global institutions and powerful government figures by offering them a piece of the action. Jho Low did significant damage to the economy of an entire country. With the United States now being led by an amoral real estate promoter who controls his attorney general like a trained dog, the chances of similar shenanigans in the U.S. hardly seem farfetched.",42,8
38743564,Billion Dollar Whale The Man Who Fooled Wall Street Hollywood and the World,Mehrsa,"2,234",3664,4,"November 23, 2018","First of all, the author makes this clear at the end, but not nearly clear enough: This is not a story about some random Malaysian conman--it's a story about Goldman sacks and hollywood and the Saudis and how greed allowed someone to lie and cheat his way to partying with Leonardo DiCaprio and Paris Hilton. Everyone can be bought. That's the moral of the story. There was some hyperbole here on the financial crime. Though Wright tries several times, he's not quite able to pull off a great explanation for why this ""crime"" was unique or even a crime--besides the fact that it didn't work out. Also, he seems to want to paint all the foreigners as corrupt and shady, but he goes light on all of Low's legal and banking ""helpers"" in America and all the money they made on him. I don't believe in the ""bad guy"" story of finance. I think we have the system we want. Low was just shadier than the average investor and less scrupulous. And he didn't make his investors rich, which I guess is why he's on the run now. Also, the money they throw around (and by they I mean all the hollywood stars and actors) in the nightclubs is obscene. Disgusting. $2 million in alcohol purchases in one night? Millions in casinos? I mean, it's revolting and yet we allow it. There is no reason for it",31,N/A
38743564,Billion Dollar Whale The Man Who Fooled Wall Street Hollywood and the World,Anas,139,4,5,"September 17, 2018","Its hard to put down this book, as if the stories were fantasies. The heist commited by Jho Low is definitely bigger than Bernie Maddoff ponzi scheme, well at least Bernie’s inverstors got their ‘profits’ back.Jho Low represents a desperate figure who wants companionship, recognition and love (even if it is fake) through money. His acts, cowardly hiding behind without holding an official position in 1MDB undoubtedly shady, but not a problem for a stupid prime minister like Najib at that time. Low’s scheme perfectly summarized in the page 371- “he sensed that the world’s largest banks, it’s auditors, and its lawyers would not throw up obstacles to his scheme if they smelled profits”Thank you to Tom Wright and Bradley Hope for writing this book. I would probably need to smuggle it if Najib wasn’t defeated back in May 2018. I hope that the publisher would consider releasing a cheaper version, and maybe translate into the Malay language so that more Malaysians can read this book.",27,5
38743564,Billion Dollar Whale The Man Who Fooled Wall Street Hollywood and the World,Venky,927,327,5,"December 27, 2019","Since the publication of All The President’s Men, Barbarians At The Gate and Too Big To Fail, there have been few books of this genre that have gripped the imagination of the reader – until the arrival of Billion Dollar Whale. A ‘whale’ is a high rolling gambler who consistently wagers large amounts of money. High rollers often receive lavish “comps” from casinos to lure them onto the gambling floors, such as free private jet transfers, limousine use and use of the casinos’ best suites.Acclaimed journalists Tom Wright and Bradley Hope combine to deliver a jaw dropping tour de force that elucidates how the impudence of a rogue individual, the intransigence at the highest levels of a rotten kleptocracy and the greedy ingenuity of a Wall Street behemoth, all combined to pull off, what arguably has to be the most brazen heist in financial history.Swindler, Fixer, Wheeler-Dealer, Compulsive liar, and globe trotter, Low Taek Jho (Jho Low) first appeared as a simmering mist when rumours regarding a possible swindling of money from Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund, 1 Malaysia Berhad (“1MDB” for short) began doing the rounds. As tumultuous events subsequently demonstrated in horrific detail, this was no swindling of a routine run-of-the-mill nature associated with the functioning of a Government fund. As Mr. White and Mr. Hope detail with extraordinary clarity, 1MDB was representative of a total collapse of governance at multiple levels. It was a gargantuan vehicle of personal convenience whose wheels were greased by the lubricants of graft. 1MBD was a mother lode of all scams that ultimately resulted in the toppling (for the first time ever) of the kleptocratic United Malys National Organisation (“UMNO”) and its strong man, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak. At the eye of the storm was Low Taek Jho.Ambitious and eager to make his mark in the world of the nouveax rich, Jho Low, an alumnus of Harrow and Wharton, banking on his Ivy League Networks persuaded the Prime Minister of Malaysia to set up a sovereign wealth fund to be named 1MDB. The fund was to partner with PetroSaudi, a company ostensibly owned by a member of Saudi Royalty, Prince Turki. What followed as Mr. White and Hope illustrate in all its grisly detail is a complex, convoluted and conniving structure that resulted in multiple companies being incorporated in various tax havens across the globe through which moneys originally intended to fill the coffers of the fund were systematically and ruthlessly siphoned off by Jho Low and his associates.The con-man proceeded to spray his loot on excesses that are hard to imagine. For instance, to celebrate his thirty-first birthday, Jho Low not only stayed at the $25,000 per night Chairman Suites of the fifth Floor of the Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas, he also arranged a grand celebration that had for attendance, Swizz Beatz, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo Di Caprio, Benicio Del Toro, Busta Rhymes, Ludacris, Chris Brown and- hold your breath- Britney Spears popping out of a faux cake to wish Low a happy birthday!This elevation of Jho Low – who otherwise would be deemed to be a parvenu within the circles of an elite – from a virtual nobody into a uber rich multi-billionaire splurging $250 million on a luxury yacht Equanimity or $8 million on acquiring jewelry to impress his could be girlfriend Miranda Kerr, was facilitated by a phalanx of unscrupulous characters who in a Faustian bargain sacrificed sense at the altar of greed.At the very apex of the pyramid was the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. Although unaware of the insidious depth of Jho Low’s macabre motives, the politician was none too averse to utilize public funds to both further his electoral prospects and to satiate the inexorable material needs of his high spending, preening and strutting wife, Rosmah Mansor. Having set up a ‘secret’ account for the Prime Minister with Ambank, a bank that had ANZ Grindlays as its largest shareholder, in March 2013, “Jho Low sent a BlackBerry message to Joanna Yu, an employee at Ambank in Kuala Lumpur, warning her that “681 American Pies” would soon be arriving from overseas into an account known as “AMPRIVATE BANKING – MR”. Very soon a whopping sum of $681 million made its way into the designated account to be used for the purposes of bolstering the chances of the Prime Minister in the ensuing elections of 2013.The stash accumulated by Rosmah Mansor was to say the least – jaw dropping! “Police raided Kuala Lumpur apartment units owned by Najib’s family and carted out $274 million worth of items, including 12,000 pieces of jewelry, 567 handbags and 423 watches, as well as $28 million in cash.”To drum up the money for 1MBD, and in the process, to obtain their own significant cut, was the ruthless Wall Street Banking giant Goldman Sachs. The duo of ‘Dr.’ Timothy Leissner, the flamboyant playboy and Chairman, South East Asia, and Andrea Vella, Head of Goldman structured finance business in Asia, who between them, ensured that, “in total over just twelve months, the bank had earned nearly $600 million from selling three bonds for the 1MDB Fund – two hundred times the typical fee.”A Board of puppets and toothless tigers at 1MDB headed by Shahrol Halmi, merely rubber stamping the orders of Jho Low and the Prime Minister contributed to a great extent to the continuing pillage. When a contentious Mohammed Bakke Salleh, the Chairman of the Fund started raising suspicions, he was promptly removed and replaced by another pliant loyalist.Three different auditing firms – part of the Big 4s – that completely failed in their duties to detect brazen round tripping and non-existent redemption of funds from obscure Cayman Island accounts.The bankers themselves who compromised on all scruples at the prospect of personal enrichment. Yak, a banker with the BSI Group in Singapore, “began to take home around $5 million a year in salary and bonuses, more than five times his previous earnings, binding him to Low, the money and adulation too alluring to turn down.”Finally, the man’s insatiable desire to be drenched in fortune and drown in fame led to a rampant fostering of greed which no amount of monetary resources could curb. Spending a staggering $85 million “on alcohol, gambling in Vegas, private jets, renting superyachts, and to pay Playboy Playmates and Hollywood celebrities to hang out with them”; renting “a suite of rooms that cost $100,000 per month”; “…acquired a condominium in New York’s Park Laurel Building…for $36 million; spending “2 million euros on champagne” in one single night at Saint-Tropez; funding Red Granite a production company co-owned by Riza Aziz, the step-son of Najib Razak and Joey McFarlane that produced the Martin Scorsese directed “Wolf of Wall Street.”The heady intoxication fueled by laundered money now began seeping into the exotic world of art. “In all between May and September 2013, Low, via Tanore, bought $137 million in art. But Low had picked up more…. such as the Van Gogh, as well as works by Lichtenstein, Picasso and Warhol, and by the end of the year he possessed art worth an estimated $330 million.” These precious acquisitions were stashed in the secretive entrepots of the Geneva Freeport – a sanctuary for preserving the material possessions of the ‘uberelite’, way beyond the prying eyes of the taxman.Mr. White and Mr. Hope have left no stone unturned in their quest to both unearth and unleash the truth. They have done a fabulous job at that! The narrative is laid out in a matter of fact, bare bones manner with neither an intention to sensationalize things nor to take biased sides. The research is maddeningly methodical and unbelievably extensive. One can only imagine the two intrepid journalists sifting through what must have been an Everest of physical and digital depositories! This sure is an 8848 meter research of exemplary calibre!When the dust finally settled on the pilfering, plunder and pillage, 1MDB was in debt to the tune of a whopping $10 billion with Low and his associates vanishing into thin air. At the time of this review, Low is a wanted fugitive with an Interpol notice hanging over his head like a Damocles sword. Swiftly running out of options, the net of justice and the harpoons of infernal hell seem to be closing down upon this invidious whale!",20,2

The book is clear and well written although it kind of require some basic financial/economic knowledge throughout the pages (thanks Google!)

38743564,Billion Dollar Whale The Man Who Fooled Wall Street Hollywood and the World,Athan Tolis,309,564,5,"November 3, 2018","The Wall Street Journal seems to be doing something right, Rupert Murdoch ownership notwithstanding, because for the second time in 2018 I find myself reading a truly amazing book that’s based on investigative work done by its correspondents.Not only that, but it can be said with some certainty that in both instances (Elizabeth Holmes’ pseudo-science in “Bad Blood” and Jho Low’s / Najib Razhak’s stolen billions in “Billion Dollar Whale”) the Journal has played a pivotal role in shining light on these crimes and bringing the criminals to justice.Indeed, I finished this book pretty much on the same day as Goldman was forced to let go of Andrea Vella, the head of its Asian business, for the crimes described here.If, like me, you are a “glass half-empty” kind of guy, of course, you will also remark that it’s a terrible state of affairs when journalists are ahead of our justice system (to say nothing of the supposed pillars of our capitalist system), but that cannot possibly detract from what was a tremendous, fast paced, comprehensive and rather convincing book.The crime of money laundering and the technique of “layering” are rather tedious, of course. And the number of characters in the book makes the “cast of characters” in the introduction a total must. But the main character in the book, Jho Low, was such a party animal that (provided you have a tolerance for what felt like at least one dodgy financial transaction per page) this was actually a fun book to read. And it tickled the voyeur in me, who got to see “how the other half live.” Frankly, I’ve now had my fill of Swizz Beats, Alicia Keys, Jamie Foxx, Leonardo DiCaprio and Miranda Kerr, to say nothing of the sundry Sheikhs, their boats and their jets; any tips on how to get the cigar smoke off my clothes are welcome!",15,N/A

38743564,Billion Dollar Whale The Man Who Fooled Wall Street Hollywood and the World,Murtaza ,664,3402,4,"December 24, 2018","This book was an absolutely infuriating glimpse at the unhinged excesses of the global elite, through the prism of 1MDB (1 Malaysia Development Bank) a sovereign wealth fund that became the vehicle for the biggest criminal enterprise on the planet. Jho Low, a young Chinese-Malaysian Wharton graduate managed to get control of billions of dollars of dollars by manipulating his relationships with his elite school contacts and Malaysia's corrupt former Prime Minister Najib Razak. He was integral in founding a sovereign wealth fund worth billions of dollars that was, on paper, intended to be used for the development of Malaysia's economy and society.What Low actually did with that money is unconscionable. He went on an unhinged spending spree the likes of which the world has seldom seen. Low surrounded himself with American celebrities and blew the Malaysian people's money on the most absurd excesses imaginable. He was helped in his industrial-scale kleptomania by corrupt Gulf Arab officials and, of course, the infamous U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs. Goldman and several other banks cashed in on Low's activities by taking huge cuts of each heist that he undertook from 1MDB and greasing the wheels for his access to the global financial system. The result was the enrichment of a tiny, corrupt global elite beyond any comprehension, as well as the corruption of Malaysia's institutions and the immiseration of its working people.The 1MBD scam was complex, but essentially involved skimming off hundreds of millions of dollars at a time off of various loans, bond issues and other transactions. The money was moved around among shell companies and investment banks around the world, with compliance officials in most cases glad to place their rubber stamps on lucrative deals. Low and his co-conspirators were known to spend millions of dollars a night on partying, though he himself was the most extravagant. Had he been even a bit more low key and more focused on keeping a tight ship, the scam could've probably continued along. It makes you wonder how many other international ""deals"" like this have occurred and are continuing to occur right now without our knowledge. The numbers involved, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars channeled to single individuals through acts of pure financial alchemy are horrifying — particularly in a world where most people survive by selling their labor for every single dollar. This book has to make you reflect on how an economic system in which things like this are possible — not just cash but billions of dollars of public loans conjured out of thin air and then stolen — can be viable. It sounds like the financial absurdities that occurred during the late Soviet Union or during other periods of systemic economic collapse. This book will undoubtedly infuriate anyone who reads it. Low didn't just spend billions of other peoples money (at least $5billion is missing from the fund and perhaps more) but wasted it on the most frivolous expenditures imaginable. He and his associates were deeply unwise and evil people. They stole from the mouths of the poor who needed those funds and spent them on excesses that did not, indeed could not, satisfy them or make them happy. Can anyone be happy spending 2 million Euros a night on champagne, just to impress a group of strangers in a French nightclub? The whole story is absolutely gripping and horrible. I abhor the romanticization of violence and am against capital punishment as a rule. But after reading this book I have to admit that I understand the symbol of the guillotine more than ever. The book made me angry enough, but if I was a Malaysian citizen reading it I'm not even sure I could finish.",11,1 comment
