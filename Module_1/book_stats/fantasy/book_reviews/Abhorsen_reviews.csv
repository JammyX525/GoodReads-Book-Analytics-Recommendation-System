334643,Abhorsen,Jessica,150,51,5,"February 7, 2011","Can I just say how shocked I am by how good this book was? I mean, I guess everything that happened in Lirael was necessary in setting the stage for Abhorsen, but man did Lirael put a damper on the Old Kingdom high I got from Sabriel. In book 2, Lirael was mopey, annoying, and the Mary-Sue from Hell. Sam was pretty angsty, too, and the book felt entirely like exposition with no real pay off at the end (with a long ways to go). Needless to say, I approached Abhorsen with distrust and apprehension, prepping myself for a letdown.AND WHAT IS THIS? LIRAEL UP IN HERE WITH A DECENT PERSONALITY AND ACTUAL CHARACTER GROWTH? SAM COMING OF AGE AND SHAPING UP LIKE A BOSS? MOGGET AND DOG REMAINING THEIR FLY SELVES AS THEY FACE THE CRAZIEST PLOT EVER? Alright, my capslock!Harry moment has passed. And I might have exaggerated a smidge, but seriously. This book was pretty epic. Dare I say, more epic than Sabriel? (Come on! The last third of the book I kept saying, “Whatever are they going to make it out of this!” or “As if someone ain’t gonna die right now!” and “There’s no way! NO WAY!”—and the first two-thirds of the book I had already been on the edge of my seat!). Now, I’d like to address something that I haven’t really mentioned in my previous reviews of the series. Most noticeably in books 1 and 3, there are really great and subtle messages sent about the gender stereotypes we’ve picked up in our lifetimes. Plenty of my favorite action heroines (be it movies or books) have to inevitably come up against some douche who refuses to answer to a girl of all things (or remember that awesome scene in RotK when Eowyn’s like, “I am no man! You look upon a woman!” and the audience goes crazy and everyone’s fist-pumping?). But, like, the story can be set 200 years in the future, in space, and some jerk acts like it’s the craziest thing in the world to see a woman save the day. That sucks, no doubt, but almost worse is when the story is set in an alternate freaking reality (usually fantasy with magic and dragons and crap), and people are still shamelessly sexist. Like, really, screenwriter/author? It made sense to you to make this completely fictional world hate women, too? But wizards live forever and stuff, right?In the Abhorsen trilogy, the roles of men and women are pretty evenly distributed between the sexes. There are both male and female royal guards and it ain’t no big thang, some tribes have matriarchs and others patriarchs, and the people of the Old Kingdom answer to the female Abhorsen and the King with equal loyalty and reverence. I mean, that just makes sense to me. If magic has existed in a world since the beginning of time, than freaking equal rights should have as well.Anywho, all-in-all, a fantastic book. It somehow successfully made me love Lirael after raging against her so much before, it totally does justice to anything left wanting regarding the mythos of the world in Sabriel (you get to see all of the nine gates of Death, so awesome!), and it kind of outdoes the final battle scene of Sabriel as well…a great conclusion! (Although I wouldn���t say no to another book in the series…)",82,11
334643,Abhorsen,Charlotte May,670,1025,4,"February 16, 2018","4.5 stars!This series just keeps getting better!We find Lirael and Sam immediately after book 2, on the hunt for Sam’s friend Nick and the evil he has accidentally gotten himself trapped in. Along with the Disreputable Dog and Mogget the cat we are taken on a fantastic ride through a world where the dead don’t stay dead!  “Confused Dead Hands staggered out of her way, gobbling their distress from their decayed throats.” Nix has created such an incredible magic system; with both Charter Magic - the fixed and governed magic but also Free Magic - the powerful and uncontrolled magic often used for evil. We even get to visit death - with its nine gates and mysterious allure.A power known as The Destroyer is rising, to destroy the Charter and create a world of fire where the dead rule.  “There would be plenty of bodies for all.” It takes everything in Lirael’s power to use the bells of the Abhorsen and save both Ancelstierre and The Old Kingdom.  “With sighs and groans and gurgles and the clicking of frozen joints and broken bones, the Dead Hands marched forward, sending the fog swirling all around them.” I was gripped from start to finish, there are constant shocks throughout and I had to see what would happen, even shed a few tears at times. I need the next book now!  “For everyone and everything, there is a time to die. Some do not know it, or would delay it, but it’s truth cannot be denied.” ",82,4
334643,Abhorsen,TS Chan,691,851,4,"February 26, 2018","Abhorsen is a great conclusion to a narrative arc which started with Lirael, the second book in the series. The two main characters introduced in the previous book, Lirael and Prince Sameth, have now accepted their respective legacies and fate in what is to become a fight for the survival of the very world itself. Finally, we have a lot more action, a lot less moping and some solid character growth with two young protagonists, both who have vast potential stemming from their unique bloodlines. There is also a third point-of-view which surfaced more regularly in this volume - Nicholas, a friend of the Prince from beyond the Wall to the south, who has fallen into the hands of the enemy and was manipulated in bringing forth ancient powers. Braving the overwhelming odds stacked against them, Lirael and Sam, together with the Disreputable Dog and Mogget, have to attempt to stop the enemy from manifesting. Else, all will be lost. As I have mentioned before, the key strength of this series lies in its worldbuilding - a world between Life and Death - and its magic - of the wild and free, and the constructs which aimed to give such magic structure and direction, with which it can also bind and break. The narrative around these fantastical elements progressed through the series with more revelations on the lore surrounding the history of Charter magic, and deeper exploration through Death and its Nine Gates. Given that this third volume serves as the final and climactic act to the story which began in the second, I will not deign to include further commentary on the plot. Even though I struggled a bit with the characters of Lirael and Sam initially, the development of their roles eventually made sense within the context of what they are becoming. In the face of the imminent and overwhelming threat to the world, both not only managed to overcome their angst but each drew upon their respective strengths as nothing but their best will suffice. The tone of the book is engaging throughout, and the narrative grabbed me right from the start. Even though I have not read much of the YA genre, I can safely say that this is probably one of the better ones out there. There is enough depth in the storytelling and characterization, which without the corresponding ages of the main protagonists, one can easily mistake it for just another classic fantasy novel. And I'll say this again - the world and its magic are positively fascinating. I do recommend this series to those who want to read a classic fantasy with a difference.This review can also be found at Booknest",46,4
334643,Abhorsen,Dannii Elle,"1,966",1378,5,"May 1, 2020","This is the third instalment in the Abhorsen series.Decades divided the events between the first and second books, but this one followed directly on from the former instalment. Lirael is the abhorsen-in-waiting, Sam is descended from Wall Makers, and their animal companions, who are less easy to classify, make up the rest of the fearsome foursome intent on saving the kingdom from the dark designs of the dead. Action dominated but tears marked the end and I was not okay!",44,2
334643,Abhorsen,Katie.dorny,948,490,3,"May 20, 2020",I honestly just found this anti-climatic. Especially when compared to the first two.The conclusion just continues on for the spin off books; which I do understand.Sam’s growth in this was wonderful; I hated him in the second book but in this one I really rooted for him.I am interested in reading Goldenhand to find out what happens to Lirael and Nicolas.I just felt that this book and the previous one could have been shortened down to one big book instead of being dragged out over two when some of the plot and description was unnecessary.,29,2
334643,Abhorsen,Stephen,"1,517",10800,5,"January 6, 2011","4.5 to 5.0 stars. Having just finished this, the final book in the Abhorsen Trilogy, I have to say that it RANKS AMONG THE BEST YA FANTASY SERIES I have ever read. The world created by Garth Nix composed of the Northern Old Kingdon (where magic exists) sitting side by side with the South (looking much like an early 20th century city in Europe) is so realistically portrayed that the whole story comes to life. The interplay between these two realms is very well done. Add to that one of the most interesting and original magic systems I have yet come across featuring among other things, free magic (wild and unbound) and charter magic (bound magic expressed through runes or marks), Abhorsens vs necromancers, lesser and greater dead, gore crows, the Great Charters and some amazingly unique free magic creatures and entities. All of these elements are woven together and used so well in the story that narrative always stays compelling and keeps the reader engrossed in the story. This will certainly me on the short list of YA fantasy series that I recommend to friends. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!! ",28,2
334643,Abhorsen,Caz (littlebookowl),301,40400,5,"April 12, 2018",Probably my favourite of the series so far! I adore these characters (especially the Disreputable Dog)!,22,N/A
334643,Abhorsen,Lindsey Rey,286,2711,3,"May 29, 2015","[3.5 Stars]I liked the ending, but I've decided I'm not the biggest fan of Garth Nix's writing style.",21,1 comment
334643,Abhorsen,✨faith✨trust✨pixiedust✨,384,289,5,"April 18, 2019","""Wherever you walk, I will be there.""*sobs*This third installment, the end of the main trilogy, was pretty darn good. There's something about Garth Nix's writing that just really does it for me. The subtle humor and wit, the syntax and sentence structure. It's all just so great. I love everything about it!The world is the best fantasy world ever, in my not so humble opinion. It isn't overbearing, but it's intricate and unique and dark without being grimdark. Death is probably the coolest setting in any book ever, and you can fight me on that.I loved the character arcs in this, especially Nick's. He didn't have much of a character in the previous book, but he really shone in this one, and his ending was just...*cries a little more* just perfect. I love how relatable all the characters are. I wish Sam had had a bit more to do in this, but as it is, I'm happy with how it all turned out.""So I'll do that, and I'll do my best and if my best isn't good enough, at least I will have done everything I could, everything that is in me. I don't have to try to be someone else, someone I could never be.""",18,2
334643,Abhorsen,Ashley,"2,550",1630,4,"February 10, 2017","I think probably the best way to describe what it's like to read the Abhorsen trilogy is to compare it to a snowball rolling down a very, very large hill. We are all familiar with this metaphor--it basically implies that the thing being compared metaphorically moves faster and becomes MORE on the way down, whether that thing is the plot or your emotions as a reader, or both. Abhorsen is like this, but also THE SNOWBALL IS ON FIRE.Sabriel introduced the world, the characters (most of them), the magic system, and the stakes. Lirael upped the ante, widening the scope of the world, but also deepening it, and ended with the characters facing the biggest challenge of their lives so far. Abhorsen is almost in its entirety devoted to confronting that challenge, like the whole book is the climax of the series, but it also has its own climax that is even more intense than the rest of the book. And the rest of the book is like a giant rollercoaster ride of emotion and action and scary stuff trying to kill you.But also, remember the snowball? IT'S STILL ON FIRE.I'm not going to say much about the plot of this book except in the vaguest terms. Firstly, that I thought it was a very fitting conclusion to the story built up in the first two books. Secondly, that the ending brought me to tears in a Starbucks. I did not anticipate this happening. I'd read it twice before, admittedly as a teenager, so I thought I knew what I was getting into. I didn't expect to me moved quite so much, particularly on the subject of death. And lastly, I understand why Nix does what he does with the Disreputable Dog, who I think I've made clear is my favorite character, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it.My only real complaint is that there wasn't enough of a coda to the events of the series. We only get the smallest inkling of the fates that befall these characters, although I suppose it is rather easy to guess. This is why I was so excited to learn he'd written a novella that takes place after the events in these books and that I'd somehow missed. It doesn't take place in the Old Kingdom, but we do get to check in with a couple of the characters. It filled a need. But also, I have more need. I'm very excited for Clariel in a couple of months, but seeing as how that's a prequel . . . look, Garth Nix. What I'm saying is I want more stories in this world. Give them to me.Give them to me now.[4.5 stars]",16,3
334643,Abhorsen,[ J o ],"1,934",425,2,"March 4, 2019","I first read these when I was much younger, probably just a few years after they were published. I must confess, before I started them I could barely recall them at all, aside from a few episodes from the first book, Sabriel. I had hastily added 3 or 4 stars to them when I transferred them to GoodReads, so they must have had a lasting impression on me for me to do that.Second re-through and I could see a little why I liked them, but they weren't the kind of thing I would love to read nowadays. I have thought about this a lot recently and I think my taste in almost all aspects of my life have changed dramatically since I was younger, so much that, although I absolutely adore Terry Pratchett's Discworld series and would probably count it as my favourite ever, I can remember being younger and not liking it at all.Sabriel was my favourite out of the three. Although it was much shorter, and barely had any plot or character development, it read like a short story and was enjoyable. Lirael and Abhorsen were much the same, though somehow longer. Garth Nix's other series, like the The Keys to the Kingdom are more Young Adult orientated and are far better, probably because he had a bit of practise beforehand.To me, the Abhorsen Trilogy, unlike quite a few other children's books, are written very much with children in mind and I wouldn't consider calling them Young Adult. Whilst there is nothing wrong with that, I personally didn't enjoy them as much as I had when a child myself.Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Pinterest | Shop | Etsy",16,N/A

334643,Abhorsen,Heather Turner,86,8,5,"April 3, 2007","As in ""Sabriel"" and ""Lirael,"" Death is a riverine chasm from which the dead can be called back to the living by powerful necromancers. Only the Abhorsen (Sabriel) or the Abhorsen-in-waiting (Lirael) can pass from life into the river of Death, through the eight Gates of fog, whirlpools, waterfalls, and shadow, and do magical combat with the necromancers in their own dark realm...Well, the Disreputable Dog can splash into Death, too and in ""Abhorsen"" you'll find out who she really is, along with Mogget the bad-tempered cat (who reminds me of some of the grouchier Jack Lemon characters).""Abhorsen"" is a worthy conclusion to Nix's Old Kingdom trilogy. Read ""Sabriel"" and ""Lirael"" before undertaking ""Abhorsen,"" so that you can familiarize yourself with the Philosophy and Geography of Death. Nix isn't into summarization or repetition. He plunges his reader right into a whirlpool of death, animated corpses, and Charter magic. If you don't already know such characters as the Disreputable Dog, the necromancer Hedge, or his bone-headed companion, Nick, you might never figure out what's going on.This book is a direct continuation of ""Lirael,"" with the ex-assistant librarian and her companion, Prince Sameth carrying on the battle against Hedge and the evil he is digging up at Red Lake. Although Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting, heir to the powers of 'The Book of the Dead' and the seven bells, Lirael now takes up that role, and Sam seeks his destiny as a descendant of the mysterious Wallmakers, who built the barrier between the magical Old Kingdom and the mundane kingdom of Ancelstierre. The two will need all of the magic they can conjure up against an enemy that threatens not only the Charter, but all living beings.The swirl and cross-currents of life gradually ebb as the dead pass through gate after gate on Garth Nix's nameless river--a river like Styx or Lethe that runs through each of our subconscious underworlds as a legacy of our water-bound gestation. It is an eerie experience to remember that journey of birth--only this time in the wake of the dead--in this marvelous fantasy trilogy. ",13,N/A
334643,Abhorsen,Krissa,94,34,4,"September 10, 2007","So everything I held against Book Two, Lirael, was released in Abhorsen. The book races, literally and figuratively - I read it in a day. The climax is beautiful, BEAUTIFUL, with all the characters you love and hate from all three books playing their part with some powerful punches. It also drags torturously through some characters' descents into madness which is, well, maddeningly written, curse Nix and his talent. I adored this trilogy and wish people would stop resisting me forcing it upon them just because, you know, it's about necromancers and bells. Please! It's awesome.",13,N/A
