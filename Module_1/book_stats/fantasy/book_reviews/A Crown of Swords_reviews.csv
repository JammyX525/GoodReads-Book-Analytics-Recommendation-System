13890,A Crown of Swords,Matt's Fantasy Book Reviews,202,2083,4,"June 4, 2022","
  Check out my YouTube channel where I show my instant reactions to reading fantasy books as soon as I finish the book
Another highly enjoyable adventure, but this time with a much slower pace.This was yet again a fun journey with characters that are now well known, and loved. At this point in the series, the writing style is highly familiar and you really know what sort of book you are going to get from a storytelling perspective. While reading, I really got the sense that Robert Jordan could take these characters anywhere, and it would be a fun experience.Unfortunately, the plot development in this book has hit a low point for the series. This book was mostly about character development, which is something I normally give high praise to, but felt a bit unnecessary with how much we already know about all these characters.My favorite parts from this book were the side POVs from random side characters and bad guys. They are a great way to mix in different perspectives and really give you the grand sense of worldbuilding that you have come to expect from Robert Jordan. Few fantasy authors, even know, let you have an inside view into so many different characters and it is highly appreciated.I had a great time reading this book, and while the ending was a bit repetitive I do find myself extremely eager to continue on with this series.",195,N/A

13890,A Crown of Swords,Em Lost In Books,843,1682,3,"September 24, 2018","When I read the prologue I thought this would be better than it's predecessor, after all it had such a great start but how wrong I was. What started as an amazing start soon turned into a slow bullock cart, picking speed only at occasions. I think I have made peace with the women in this story. Nothing can change them (hoping against hope Sanderson did a better job when he wrote the final books). They will always make me angry, cringe, exasperated, and irritated with their antics, and I have to accept them as they are if I want to keep on reading this story. This book introduces a lot of new characters, of which Cadsuane Melaidhrine impressed me the most. She had this aura of mystery around her. Almost everyone was so eager to please her or at least not to be on her wrong side. I am eager to know more of her powers and role she's going to play in Rand's campaign against the Dark Lord. In so many ways this book belongs to Matrim Cauthon. First he was always there to rescue me when the girls became unbearable with their cat fights or too high opinion of themselves lend them into trouble. He was always there to play the hero and gave us some much needed light moments. His character developed a lot in this book and him forgiving Nynaeve and Elyane; and then helping and protecting them on their mission, was a big step on his part. Even if he was following Rand's orders, there were times when he volunteered for some dangerous tasks. Even after being slow events of this book surely moved the story forward and it will be interesting to what happens in the next book. ",156,N/A
13890,A Crown of Swords,Markus,469,1509,4,"February 23, 2016","One fact, though, turned up again and again in those tales. The Laurel Crown of Illian had been given a new name. The Crown of Swords.And for some reason, men and women who told the tales often found a need to add almost identical words. The storm is coming, they said, staring southward in worry. The storm is coming.Whooooooosh.That‚Äôs just the sound of the plot development being blown out the window.A Crown of Swords is the slowest Wheel of Time book so far, by a clear mile. If you think any of the previous books were slow, you‚Äôre in for a surprise. But then again, if you‚Äôve started reading this series, or even intend to read it at some point, you‚Äôve probably already been warned several times that yes, this series does become incredibly slow at some point. There‚Äôs no need for me to repeat that here.Nothing happened in this book. So why did I still like it so much? The answer is simple. Because Robert Jordan is the best worldbuilder in fantasy since Tolkien. These last few books in the series have been able to give me a feeling I‚Äôve only had with two works of fantasy before. It‚Äôs impossible to describe, but exclusively positive. And that makes me blind to the books‚Äô flaws, most importantly the lack of plot development. I don‚Äôt care about that. I just want to spend more time in this world.And finally the protagonists seem to have grown up a bit. Mat is turning into a great character, Egwene has already been awesome for a while, Rand becomes more and more of an interesting protagonist, Nynaeve has improved a lot and even Aviendha is considerably less annoying. I don‚Äôt think I hate anyone anymore. Besides Elaida. The Dark One take you, Elaida.I think I'm in love with this series.Wheel of Time reviews:#1

13890,A Crown of Swords,Kat  Hooper,"1,582",395,2,"March 31, 2009","ORIGINALLY POSTED AT Fantasy Literature.My reviews of The Wheel of Time novels are getting just as repetitive as the actual books. There's really not much more to say. A Crown of Swords is another long slow installment in which there are too many detailed descriptions of clothing, references to spanking, concerns about bosoms, and people blushing. There are pages and pages which chronicle secondary characters' extensive internal thoughts. But what bugs me most, though, are the constant depictions of people and places as if they have a corporate personality:""Men strutted arrogantly along the streets with often ragged vests and no shirts, wearing great brass hoops in their ears and brass finger rings set with colored glass, one knife or sometimes two stuck behind their belts. Hands hovering near knives, they stared as though daring someone to give the wrong twist to a look. Others skulked from corner to corner, doorway to doorway with hooded eyes, imitating the slat-ribbed dogs that sometimes snarled from a dark alleyway barely wide enough for a man to squeeze into. Those men hunched over their knives and there was no way to tell which would run and which stab. By and large, the women made any of the men appear humble, parading in worn dresses and twice as much brass jewelry as the men. They carried knives too, of course, and their bold dark eyes sent ten sorts of challenge in every glance ... Children darted from every second door with chipped pottery cups of water, sent by their mothers in case the Wise Women wished a drink. Men with scarred faces and murder etched into their eyes stared openmouthed at seven Wise Women together, then bobbed jerky bows and inquired politely if they could be of assistance, was there anything that required carrying? Women, sometimes with as many scars and always eyes to make Tylin flinch, curtsied awkwardly and breathlessly asked whether they might supply directions, had anyone made a bother of themselves to bring so many Wise Women?""If I found myself in this place, I'd think it was The Twilight Zone!I will say, however, that someone must have told Mr Jordan to quit with the braid yanking, because Nynaeve seems to be attempting to stop the habit. Now, if we could just get all of those ladies to stop adjusting their clothes every time they feel any sort of negative emotion... and I'll be happy on the day that an Aes Sedai can walk down the street without making someone flinch, cringe, jump, squeak, drop something, or run away.With all this detailed description, there's not much time for action. There are only a few significant plot developments. The most important one is an event which we've been waiting for for the last 3 books (at least) which finally occurs very quickly and anti-climatically in the last chapter of this book. But, if you've read this far into The Wheel of Time, that's no surprise, is it? And, if you've read this far, you feel like it's too late to stop now, don't you?I'm listening to this on audiobook (no patience for the print versions) and I should mention that Michael Kramer and Kate Reading are amazing readers. After all this time, I suppose these characters are almost like family to them, and they've got the personalities down perfectly. Their voices and additions of droll humor really instill some much-needed life into these novels. Read more Robert Jordan book reviews at Fantasy literature. ",62,7
13890,A Crown of Swords,Robin (Bridge Four),"1,573",1461,4,"August 2, 2016","Month 7 means book 7 of the Wheel of Time series with the Hard Core Fantasy buffs at Buddies Books and BaublesThe Wheel of Time and I have an interesting relationship. Almost all of the characters totally infuriate me but I love the writing, cultures, world building and overall plots so even when in this book everything moves at a snail‚Äôs pace and almost nothing really happens plot wise I‚Äôm still thoroughly entertained and enjoy most of the story. But seriously the plot is moving along like this‚Ä¶.But here is what I‚Äôve learned during my time with the Wheel.‚ù∂ - The Wheel Weaves as the Wheel Wills. What does this mean exactly? Well it pretty much means that at any time anything can happen. Especially with Ta‚Äôveren about to increase the chances that the pattern will adjust to their needs at anytime.
  ‚ÄúUntamed men are often the most interesting. To talk to.‚Äù A finger outlined his lips. ‚ÄúAn untamed rogue who travels with Aes Sedai, a ta‚Äôveren who, I think, makes them a little afraid. Uneasy, at the least. It takes a man with a strong liver to make Aes Sedai uneasy. How will you bend the Pattern in Ebou Dar, just Mat Cauthon?‚Äù
‚ù∑ - There will be a prophecy or five and it will probably not go exactly how you think.
  ‚ÄúThe White Tower will be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned,whole and stronger than ever. Rand al‚ÄôThor will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds. This I Foretell.‚Äù
Although most of this one could go like I think, the part about the Black Tower is still very up in the air.‚ù∏ - If you are from the Two Rivers then you are more likely to distrust the people you grew up with and completely trust someone who is most likely a darkfriend. Seriously this is that part that frustrates me the most. Rand, Mat and Perrin were best of friends growing up. Thick as thieves all of their lives. Now each is Ta‚Äôvern and has a specific part to play in the final battles to come and they are more likely to distrust each other than to try to help each other out. Actually often times when they do help each other it is by complete accident.And the women they grew up with Egwene and Nynaeve it is the same issue. You would almost think they were enemies the way they all treat one another instead of people who were close in a small village and grew up together. But throw a darkfriend or Forsaken in the midst of them and that is almost always the person they decide to trust with a ridiculous amount of information and power.‚ùπ - If you can channel the one power then you lose some form of common sense. I seriously think that there is only a small section of Aes Sedai that I like. For the most part they seem far too arrogant and self-serving to actually get anything done. Even the ones I do/did like tend to go to extremes and I really want to smack them. 
  Mixing with Aes Sedai was too much like wading the streams in the Waterwood near to the Mire. However peaceful the surface, currents beneath could snatch you off your feet. 
‚ù∫ - The details for the cultures and places is going to be fantastic and rich. You will definitely see not only the great differences but also the nuances between the Aiel, Domani, the Sea Folk and Seanchan. There are rich histories and reasons that each culture evolved as it did. This is really Jordan‚Äôs strong suit. He completely struggles a little with interpersonal relationships but the world building is impeccable.Even though this book barely moved any portion of the plot forward I still enjoyed most of it. There were a lot of great parts and fantastic characters. I did have a huge problem with one section thought and I‚Äôm totally going to go off on it for a second.As I said before, Jordan struggles with interpersonal relationships. Often for our main characters the jump from just meeting to being in love is really short and has very little page time dedicated to the buildup of an actual relationship. But in this book he really missed his mark with the character development he was trying to give Mat.What I believe Jordan was trying to do. Mat is a bit of a skirt chaser but we always get the sense that the skirts want to be chased and everyone is having a good time. But when Jordan tried to turn the tables on Mat and have a woman in power go after his attentions it is supposed to come off as a little funny and haha Mat how does it feel to have the tables turned. This is needed to set him up to be more receptive to the Daughter of the Nine Moons who he was prophesized to marry eventually. It was supposed to be cute and maybe a little What actually happened or at least how I saw it was totally and completely rape. Look I get that isn‚Äôt what he really wanted to come across but that is totally how I saw it. The Queen Tylin takes a liking to Mat and decides he is going to be her lover. She tries to get him alone, she limits what the kitchens will give him as food, she ambushes him in his rooms and when he tries to turn he down and move her away setting his hands on her she pulls her knife and there is a fade to black scene. The next day Mat is ashamed, wants to cry and doesn‚Äôt want anyone else to know. There is no mention that he loved it and wants to be with her. He acts like he was a victim and tries to avoid her at all costs.It was very poorly portrayed and if it was the man on the other end it would definitely totally be rape without question.If I didn‚Äôt think that it was totally not his intention to portray it in a comical sense I might have given up right there. Especially after how Elayne and Nynaeve treat the situation. But I‚Äôll give Jordan a pass since all of the romantic entanglements have been handled almost as equally poorly. Best New Friendship Award - Goes to Mat and Birgetta. I love those two on page together. I‚Äôm glad Mat has one woman in his life that he likes to hang out with and isn‚Äôt interested in kissing.Non-Evil Character I want to push off a Cliff - This still goes to Elayne. The haughty daughter heir still drives me a bit crazy. She is a bit better with Avienda around to teach her Toh but I still don‚Äôt like her.OverallI‚Äôm still in it to win it and I was warned there would be a few slower books so I am prepared for them. Even though my review is a bit critical I really do like most of the characters when they are not being stupid to one another and like the intensity of the bad guys and the overall march to kill the dark one eventually.

13890,A Crown of Swords,Alex Nieves,168,620,4,"June 27, 2021","Full video review here: https://youtu.be/zGgcDy6fWP0Was this the beginning of the slog? It certainly didn't feel like it to me. This was another solid entry to the series and while it wasn't as action packed as others, it was never boring. This was a great book for character work and made my favorites even better. There was payoff for things that were foreshadowed since Eye of the World and it just goes to show the amount of planning that went into this series. Onward to Path of Daggers!",50,3
13890,A Crown of Swords,Marc *Dark Reader of the Woods*,757,119,3,"January 20, 2022","This is why you should never skip leg day:Seriously, how on earth does a person stand this way? Is that supposed to be Rand? Dude's supposed to be 20 years old, not like this weather-beaten asshole. Who the hell does he think he's about to box, there's no one there! Why is he looking at me? Why is all of the original U.S. hardcover art for this series so bad in these details?*****************************This book appears to split readers. Some think it's the beginning of the well-known mid-series slump, while I and others find it refreshingly action-filled and one of the better books in this part of the series. Plenty of important events happen: Cadsuane enters the narrative; Mat and Elayne and Nynaeve's Ebou Dar adventure plays out, complicated by discovery of the Kin, Darkfriends, the Black Ajah, and a new Forsaken-provided deadly element; Rand really starts to lose his temper; Rand finally confronts the rebel nobility from Tear and Cairhien, and more.  I wonder if having read the series before lets me enjoy it more, knowing what story beats are leading to rather than seeing the plot flail without specific expectations. But the Ebou Dar events are the only mostly-complete arc in this book, while all other significant events are part of the longer series narrative, and this might be why so many readers struggle to enjoy these books. Each one often fails to give us a self-contained story, and multiple significant threads are neglected or barely addressed in any particular volume. Case in point: dealing with Sammael in Illian. Two books ago, Rand was gathering a massive army at the border, while disclosing to the reader that this was all a feint. That action went nowhere in Fires of Heaven, further went nowhere in Lord of Chaos, and again went nowhere until the very last chapter of this book, when it rushed to its conclusion. We need more and stronger single-book arcs within the broader series. This was particularly keen for readers of yore who were waiting for each new book to land, at a time when the gap between each volume increased. Even now with all of the books at our disposal, the length of each one leaves the reader yearning for satisfaction. I particularly dislike the storyline involving the Shaido Aiel. Could they be any more of a Slytherin? A whole Aiel clan, coincidentally sounding like ""shadow"", whose only purpose is to be evil bunglers and irritants. I know I'm going to dislike their role in the next two books, from what I recall. The Wheel of Time is about plot more than any other factor. Characters are significant, but the books are about what happens to the characters more than any character development in its own right. I am not sure that I actually like any of the characters. I enjoy many of their storylines, but I would never have been upset if any major character died. I like Mat the most but only in small doses, and only at this point in the series; previous Mat was unimpressive, and I remain mystified about how and when he developed into current-Mat. When exactly did he have time to become a serial womanizer and roll in the hay with ladies high and low? It's been less than two years since the story began, at which point he was just a young scamp of a farmboy. Since then he spent weeks in flight, then months under the influence of the Shadar Logoth dagger, much of that unconscious, then weeks fleeing Tar Valon. It's only the down time in Tear between Dragon Reborn and Shadow Rising that he had any time to get used to dicing in taverns and pinching bottoms. This part of his personality pre-dated going to Rhuidean, so it's not the memory holes getting filled that informed this part of Mat's character. It's a detail that irks me, is all. And now some MAJOR SPOILERS for the series, although none beyond this book. Whenever I read this series before, I struggled to keep track of the Forsaken. There were just so damn many of them, and especially once they started coming back in new bodies and disguises and all that it was just impossible for my younger self. At the same time I adored the Forsaken; their POV chapters are always the best. Here is my personal record of where they are all at:  FATE OF THE FORSAKENAginor Killed by Rand at the Eye of the World; burned up when Rand stole away the connection to the EotW saidin. BUT now resurrected as Osan'gar. Asmodean Killed by ??? in a ""Oh, it's you,"" moment, not expected to be resurrected because of betrayal. Balthamel  Killed bodily by the Green Man. Resurrected as Aran'gar, now in a female body but still uses Saidin, which raises all kinds of questions about gender and souls and accessing the male/female halves of the One Power. Be'lal Balefired by Moiraine; was High Lord Samon in Tear. Ishamael = Ba'alzamon - Bodily stabbed through heart by Rand with Callandor in the Stone of Tear. Pretty sure he was resurrected as Moridin. Lanfear Shoved into the red twisted doorframe by Moiraine; dead? I am pretty sure that she was the mystery man who appeared to help Rand in Shadar Logoth when he was fighting Sammael; he didn't feel ""him"" channeling when they both used balefire, and ""his"" dialogue was all consistent with Lanfear. I swear I don't remember anything about this from past series reads! This is new speculation!Rahvin Balefired by Rand in Tellaranrhiod/Caemlyn, where he usurped rule as Gaebril.Demandred - hates Rand (the Dragon). Is he posing as Mazrim Taim? Graendal - lurking in Arad Doman. Allied with Sammael. Mesaana - in disguise in the White Tower. Moghedien - ""the spider""; freed from captivity by Aran'gar but now slave to Moridin. Sammael - Rand thinks he was killed by Mashadar when they fought in Shadar Logoth but there's no reason for the reader to believe he's dead.

Even though many Wheel of Time fans cite this book as when the series really starts to slow down, I actually enjoyed this one more than the last two books! I'm kind of surprised I liked this book more, when the two preceding ones tend to be very popular amongst most fans. Either I'm getting used to the slower pace, or maybe, I'm just not quite... normal?!?(Nah, that can't be it!)

13890,A Crown of Swords,Tea,36,7,2,"November 19, 2011","It is often difficult to reconcile how much I love the adventure of this series with the blatant sexism that pervades nearly every chapter involving a woman interacting with a man. In the first four books, it wasn't as much of an issue, because I saw it mostly as an in-world problem rather than something inherently problematic with Jordan's perspective that was interfering with his ability to tell a good and believable story. This changed in book five, where the ridiculousness exploded to such an extent that it didn't read like and in-world problem, but rather just a bad decision on the part of the author. It made all of his female characters look possessed. The good news was that the horrid portrayals of all of the main women in the story spouting sexist lines between each breath dissipated somewhat, partially because Min got so much POV time, and Birgitte and Aviendha were not caught up in it either, which was a relief. Not that it was not there, but the forced ridiculousness was less prevalent in this regard than in previous books.But then chapter 29 happened, and was followed by the rest of the book, and this was by far the worst thing out of all that had happened in the series thus far, mostly because it was the author's storytelling blunder.Mat was raped by Tylin. More times that I could count, or would bother. This after being starved, stalked, and held at knife-point. This after being sexually harassed for several chapters prior. I remembered the rape from my first time reading the book many years ago, but I could not remember how it was that Jordan delt with it.I was somewhat heartened in the beginning of the book, after Morgase has been raped (repeatedly) by Valda that nothing about that fact was taken as funny or silly or excused away by this or that. In spite of what has happened to Morgase (and the effects are obvious), she still manages muster inner strength to fight back and lead her party away from the Children of the Light. I could deal with that.What happened with Mat was another story. I was disgusted with the behavior of Tylin and the enthusiastic support she received from palace hands and other Ebou Dari women, but even that I was able to understand as an in-world problem rather than a problem with how the author was presenting the story. When Tyling raped Mat the first time, and times after, I was furious, disgusted, and sick, but I was still able to understand it as an in-world problem. It was also clear to me from the way in which Mat was responding to the whole thing that even if he didn't call it ""rape"", the very definition of it is what he has in mind when he thinks of what Tylin has done to him. I also that that his response to the whole thing--too ashamed to tell others, wanting to cry at various moments--was extremely realistic. And up until Elayne finds out about it, I was quite certain that Jordan was taking the whole thing seriously, and that it was no laughing matter--Ebou Dari women be damned.And then Elayne found out, and her response--to laugh, even when believing that Mat was indeed a victim--just crumbled everything. The rape went from an in-world problem to a problem with Jordan's presentation. The minute Elayne laughed, deciding that Mat was ""getting a taste of his own medicine"" was the minute I wanted to put the book through the shredder. It was one thing for the Ebou Dari women to laugh, but is another for a POV Heroine, one of the supposed ""good guys"" to make a mockery of rape. I have never cared for Elayne, only particularly being thrilled by her character when she first met Rand, and when she took control of the Aes Sedai in Ebou Dar, but this just ruined it. Although we never see Nynaeve's immediate reaction upon hearing the news, she was at the very least furious with Tylin, not at all amused. But Elayne?It was a poor, poor move on Jordan's part. Just when I thought he was actually taking the whole thing seriously he destroys the ""good"" image of one of the characters. If I wanted to read about the moral atrocities of even the best of people, I would have been reading A Song of Ice and Fire. It's one thing for them to have faults and biases, but at the very least I hope that I still give a damn about the fact that they are trying to fight the Shadow--and in Elayne's case, I really don't. She might as well laugh at what Rahvin or Valda did to her mother. And honestly, when the hero laughs at rape, it is very difficult not to interpret that as the author's personal feelings.That extreme atrocity aside, this was mostly a book of smaller, world-building discoveries rather than huge plot developments. The revelation of the Kin, Egwene's realization of Gareth Bryne's loyalties, the increasing presence of Moridin and Shadar Haran and their powers and interests, as well as more insight into the Asha'man and their abilities---if you're a person who likes these little things, the book as much to offer. If you prefer the large plot-altering events of the previous books, ACOS will seem mostly lackluster.",41,8
13890,A Crown of Swords,Gavin,849,384,4,"June 17, 2017","This was another enjoyable instalment in Robert Jordan's epic Wheel of Time series. Anyone who has reached this stage of the series knows exactly what to expect from Jordan's writing and the story. The guy is an excellent storyteller and it is easy to get caught up in the stories of the various characters we have grown to like in the earlier books. Not that it was a book without flaws. I did enjoy reading this one but it is fair to say that in terms of overall plot advancement very little actually happened. This was a book that mostly focused on character growth and in that regard it was an excellent book for a number of the characters. We also got plenty of humour and a bit of action. So how did our main characters fare in this one?Rand - The guy had a great outing. He is getting a little arrogant in his role as Dragon Reborn, but I think his new confidence is mostly a good thing. He dealt well with a few political adversaries and got to battle a few of his main enemies. Perrin - It was a quiet book for Perrin and he did not really feature much apart from the early stages. He did get sent off on a task that promises a larger and more interesting part for him in the next instalment. Mat - This was a fantastic book for Mat. As always his scenes are stuffed full of humour but he showed good character growth and got to perform plenty of heroics. Egwene - She had a quiet book but definitely seems to be growing into her new role and is getting more likeable by the book.Nynaeve - She is still something of a comedy character for Jordan at the moment but her POV is never a boring one. Elayne, Aviendha, Min - I thought this was a fantastic book for Min. She really stood out as a good match for Rand. The other pair fared OK in this one without having much to do. Elayne bonded a bit with Mat which was good. As always we got a bunch of POV scenes from random villains and side characters. They were great for the most part and I always think they add an extra dimension to the story. All in all this was a good book. Yeah, the ending was one we have read before but who cares? Not me!

That's purely because of Tylin, it would probably have been much higher without her!I've fallen so far behind our group buddy read of this series thanks to this book. I read it back inJuly and I've spent the last couple of months trying to pretend it never existed. I was so in love with this series, yes there were problems with it but I was still completely hooked on the story and eager to find out what would happen next, but then I read A Crown of Swords and it nearly ruined everything.I've ignored the fact that nearly every single female character spends half their time acting like an idiot and the rest screeching like a fishwife; I've put to one side the fact that Robert Jordan is pretty hopeless at creating believable romantic relationships (seriously do any of the couples actually speak to each other or do they all just stare longingly across the distance before suddenly declaring themselves head over heels in love?); and I've not even minded the way the story is taking so long to actually get anywhere but I can't ignore Tylin's actions in this book. I've tried so hard to forget about it but every time I think about this book I want to start screaming. There is just nothing on this planet that can justify the direction the story took and even though I'm sure there were lots of other brilliant plot developments in this instalment I can't remember a single one of them because they've all been eclipsed by Tylin the rapist queen.I'm going to give the author the benefit of doubt and assume he meant for the scenes between Mat and Tylin to be amusing but he couldn't have missed the mark more badly if he'd tried. If Mat (or any other male character) had forced Tylin to sleep with him at KNIFE POINT there would have (rightfully!) been uproar. Just because Tylin is female she seems to get away with it but rape is rape and it is NEVER acceptable. It's not something that should be used as an ""amusing"" plot device either because it is NOT a laughing matter. The way she stalked Mat was downright creepy and it got to the point where every time her name appeared on the page I started feeling nauseous but when we reached that scene with the knife I nearly broke my kindle by throwing it across the room. Just what was the author thinking putting that scene in there? Where were the editors? Why did nobody think to question it before it was sent out into the hands of the unsuspecting public?I'm sure there were good parts to this book because I wouldn't have made it to the end if there hadn't been but I literally can't remember a single thing that happened apart from the scenes with Mat & Tylin. I know that sounds crazy considering Tylin wasn't even on the page for at least three quarters of the book but she's such a sore point that it's all that stuck in my mind. I have such mixed feelings about A Crown of Swords that I'm not even sure that I want to carry on reading this series anymore but I've invested so much time in it that I feel obliged to see it through to the end. Fellow buddy readers have assured me that Tylin isn't even mentioned in The Path of Daggers and at the moment that's the only thing enticing me to give it a try. I really, really hope that Robert Jordan can rekindle my love for the series with that book but he's got his work cut out and at the moment I'm not holding my breath._____________________________Buddy read with Buddies, Books & Baubles starting 1st July 2016Full review coming soon but these are my thoughts immediately after I finished reading:I'm so relieved that this book is over, I actually came VERY close to DNFing it thanks to bloody Tylin. Just because she's a woman doesn't make her behaviour any less creepy or acceptable, she forces Mat to have sex with her by holding a knife to his throat FFS! When Nynaeve and the others think it's Mat forcing his attentions they're reading to string him up by his balls (and rightly so if he had done it!) but when they find out that it's actually Tylin behaving so despicably they LAUGH! Why the hell do they find it funny? Robert Jordan missed the mark so badly with those scenes that I came incredibly close to rage quitting the series.I'm not going to let one character ruin the Wheel of Time for me though, she certainly isn't the only one that gets on my nerves (although she's definitely the worst!) and I've invested far too much time reading it to quit now. I just hope to god that we don't see more of Tylin in the next book though or I may end up throwing my kindle across the room! It's infuriating that I'm so angry about one particular event that I can barely even remember the rest of this book, I need time to process and remember the good stuff before I write a full review for this one or I'm going to end up dropping that rating even lower than a 3.",28,6
