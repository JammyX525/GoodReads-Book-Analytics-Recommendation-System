10572,A Clash of Kings,Cassy,159,617,4,"August 5, 2019","This isn’t going to be a cutesy review. I am well into the third book. I fear that if I don’t blurt out my thoughts about this one soon, then all the books in the series are going to meld together in my memory. Here are my three main impressions:1. Bleak, dreary, and dismalDon’t expect any happiness in this book. Martin is merciless with his characters. And if you do see a bright light, don’t trust it. One character learned she won’t have to marry an abusive, horrible guy. She and I were elated. Then someone pointed out that her ex-fiancé could still abuse her as he desires, and few would be able to stop him.2. Eeny, meeny, miny, moeIt occurred to me halfway through a big battle that I didn’t know who I was rooting for. The defender is a cruel king and has a tenuous claim to the throne, but I like a few of the characters in his castle and feared what would happen to them if they lose. The attacker would probably be a fair king, yet he is cold and distant. He has a better claim than most to the throne. However I doubt he could hold it for long. Precisely who did I want to win? It was not a problem of apathy. Martin drew the characters and politics so craftily that I just could not decide. Honestly, instead of picking, I sat back and enjoyed the twists and turns.3. Better keep up!The scope of the plot is ever-expanding. I give Martin kudos for having such a grand vision and keeping it all straight. I don't feel that any of the storylines are unnecessary (except, I hate to say it, maybe Arya’s). And I have complete faith that they will culminate in the most amazing way by the end of series. Yet it is inevitable that you will prefer some perspectives over others. I counted the pages in between Daenerys’ chapters – an average of 130 pages! And this is a middle book. There are no cliffhangers, but very little is resolved. If it is resolved, that means someone died. Unless they are only pretending to be dead, of course.I lied. One more point.4. Awesomeness",682,50

10572,A Clash of Kings,karen,"3,968",17000,5,"June 20, 2018","WINTERFELLLLLLL!!obey your nerds. is what i am learning.srsly - i was never going to read this series, but once i started... it is like a drug. and - yes - i watched season two before i read this book, but i am not going to wait for seasons 3-4 to read the next one, no way, because i am hooked and I MUST KNOW! and if any one of you people spoils the third book for me, i am going to make one of those torture devices with the bucket, the rat, and the torch, and it is bye-bye stomach for you!i see now why it takes him so long to write these things. this is the densest and more fully-realized world i have ever read. martin just plants these little seeds, and they sometimes take hundreds of pages to sprout but when they do - oh my word! and there are so many little details, so much backstory, so many overlaps and connections, and history and so much depth to this world. it feels so genuine. it is like my beloved donald harington - where he created an entire town full of people and then just set them loose and let them live their lives, and his touch is so light that it feels like he is just writing down his observances of them rather than creating them, because the mind simply reels at the idea that all of these details and tight storylines came from one person's mind. but with martin, the scope is so much bigger. and it kills me. there is just so. much. going on.i loved the second season. and i love how reading the book after the season really enhanced my enjoyment. most of the show is faithful to the book, but not as much as the first season/book. but one is not better than the other. i am sad that some of the book-things didn't make it into the show, and sad that some of the show-things were not in the book.but together - ahhhh - my brainheart is pleased.the characters whose stories changed the most from the book to the screen are 
  
(??? it is almost entirely changed for the show)and 
  
i mean, really - what could be better than every single one of these scenes:
  
so i was sad it was not in the book at all.and obviously, all his stuff:
  
cuz he isn't even in the book. robbed! oh my god, a pun!!hmmm more thoughts...at first, i hated 
  
because of his affectation-laden dialogue. but oh, man, did i ever come around. and now i want one for my very own.and who is a worse human being??
  
or 
  
??i am still deciding, but i am rubbing my hands in glee in anticipation of just desserts. although martin's sense of justice is very specific and unpredictable. but a girl can dream.the book is by no means perfect. every time it got to one of 
  
's pov chapters, i was all zzzzzzzzzzzzz. because, obviously, the only perspective that matters is 
  
who is great in the books, but somehow even better onscreen. and everything with
  
is wayyy better onscreen, and since she is one of my favorite actresses, i am glad she has a lot more to do than was written for her originally.and george r.r. martin...so that is hardly a book review, but there are a lot of reviews for this book and i am pretty much ordering you to go out and read these right now, so just do it and stop your backtalk. i leave you with this thought:and this one, because oh my god - what a perfect comparison that i somehow overlooked!twins!! my beloveds!now go read.oh, but p.s. - CHAINS!!!god i loved this book.come to my blog![""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",385,191
10572,A Clash of Kings,Petrik,654,39700,5,"September 4, 2022","4.5/5 starsA Clash of Kings was a brilliant sequel that brought the spotlight of the series to one of the most well-written characters in fantasy: Tyrion Lannister.A Clash of Kings is the second book in A Song of Ice and Fire saga by George R. R. Martin. The main story in this sequel mainly revolves around the multiple kings of Westeros battling in full force for the right to sit in the Iron Throne. This, however, is just scratching the surface of the story. Martin built upon everything he has established in the first wonderfully and with that, the scale of the story has become much bigger than before that I found it quite a difficult task to review this tome without spoiling anything, but spoiler-free review as always it is. Just like my review on A Game of Thrones, I’ll be doing some qualities comparison between the book and its TV series (Season 2) adaptation.Picture: A Clash of Kings by Marc SimonettiContinuing immediately from where the story left off in the previous book, Martin implemented a lot of incredible elements into the story such as shifting alliance, utterly engaging politics, intricate world-building expansion, and most importantly, compelling morally grey characters. There were new POV characters introduced in this installment and a lot of great character developments imbued. Although a lot of events happened in this book, this doesn’t mean that A Clash of Kings was a fast-paced read, honestly I found it even slower than its predecessor. Regarding pacing, in my opinion the TV series offered a better experience. However, unlike the first season where it pretty much adapted the book scene by scene, there were a few changes done for the second season of the TV series; some for better, some for worse, but overall I still think that the TV series did a spectacular job once again on adapting another installment of this series for the wider audience. 
  
    “There's no shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it.” 
  
The devil lies in the details, and Martin delivered intricacies not only on world-building but on every aspect of the book/series. I can make this review longer than it should be by talking about each character’s merits and cons to highlight Martin’s awesome characterizations, but I’ll refrain from doing that here and instead focus on one main character, Tyrion Lannister.
  
     “People often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it's served up.” 
  
It doesn’t matter whether it’s the book or the TV shows, Tyrion Lannister is my favorite character of the series and having finally read the two books of the original material, I can already vouch that he’s one of the most well-written characters in fantasy. He’s witty, cunning, smart, and despite all the physical disabilities he has as a dwarf, he never gives up and knows how to use the one thing he’s best with: his brain. Reading the book, I can feel that Martin had a lot of fun writing his character. Martin’s characterizations in this book shined the most when Tyrion’s POV came to play and luckily there were a lot of them. Don’t get me wrong, many of the other characters and events were crucial in making this book as good as it was, but overall, more than anything, I genuinely think that A Clash of Kings is a magnificent book about Tyrion Lannister and if you love his character as much as I do, you’re most likely going to have a good time reading this worthy sequel. Also, I personally think Peter Dinklage did a super terrific job in portraying this complex character, and it has been repeatedly proven as the series progressed.
  
     “When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.” 
  
World-building wise, the novel provides insights into more magic and setting of the series. Martin is an amazing world-builder, it gets even more evident the more I progress through the series. The politics of King’s Landings were meticulously written, the dialogue between characters was immensely enjoyable, and the world he created is brimming with mysteries and revelations; they all made up for the slow pacing of the tome. There was only one big action piece happening within this book, The Battle of the Blackwater that happened at the final section of the book. Action sequences aren’t really Martin’s strongest talent as an author, The Battle of the Blackwater was the only big action sequence and it happened for more or less 50 pages; that’s out the two books (1,800+ pages) I’ve read so far combined. However, the battle itself was finely written. Martin’s prose has a strong immersion and vivid power that during this battle, the frantic situation, the swirling flame, the madness of the river, the vanishing of the deck, and the chaos were so easily imagined in my head. 
  
     “So many vows... they make you swear and swear. Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his. But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It’s too much. No matter what you do, you’re forsaking one vow or the other.”
  
Admittedly, there were a few sections of the book that were simply too slow. I’m speaking specifically on Bran’s POV, which I found to be extremely boring. Remember, I’m reviewing this based on my experience as a first-time reader of the series who watched the TV shows first; I already know the major plot twists and events happening within the series. Because of this, Bran’s POV probably ended up becoming even more boring than it should be.
  
     “He who hurries through life hurries to his grave.” 
  
Although I loved A Game of Thrones more, safe for a few hiccups in pacing, A Clash of Kings is a worthy sequel that expands the world, histories, characterizations, and conflicts of the series fantastically. I truly enjoyed reading this one, and I have no doubt that I will enjoy the next one too. It goes without saying that I highly recommend this series to epic fantasy reader.You can order the book from: Book Depository (Free shipping)You can find this and the rest of my reviews at Novel Notions",314,24
10572,A Clash of Kings,Melissa Rudder,175,236,4,"April 18, 2011","It was right about at the beginning of George R. R. Martin’s A Clash of Kings, the second book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, that I admitted to myself that I wanted to quit my job and everything else in my life so I could stay home and read all day. I resisted the urge. I’m still not quite sure if I made the right decision.You think you know someone, and then you read the second book about her. (Or him. Though, for the most part, the changes of the hers were more exciting for me in this book. Minus the most clever and entertaining character to waddle through the pages of a fantasy book, who will go unnamed so I don’t spoil the fact that he lived through the first book. Okay, I may have given it away a little.) It’s not that the characters went through any unrealistic shifts; it’s just that Martin let us get to know them even better and we got to watch how they responded to new situations. Or at least I did. You may not have even read A Clash of Kings yet. Your loss. I think enjoyed the first book more because the slow corruption of an innocent and stable world interested me. But everything else that utterly enthralled me from the first book—the complex and endearing characters, the mystery and intrigue, the moments when honor, family, love, and pride all seem at odds with one another—was there in the second, and was amplified because, with each chapter, I grew more and more invested. Don’t start this series unless you’re ready to devote yourself to reading every published book of it. I don’t know what I’m going to do when I’ve finished the fourth book and have to sit around waiting for Martin to write and publish the rest. That will be a sad, sad day.Quotes! “Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them.”“He who hurries through life hurries to his grave.” “A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless.”“When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain.” “Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him.”""People often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it's served up.""""There's no shame in fear... what matters is how we face it.""""A man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm.""""When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.""""The best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause.""""Oh, to be sure, there is much we do not understand. The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We look at mountains and call them eternal, and so they seem... but in the course of time, mountains rise and fall, rivers change their courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities sink beneath the sea... Everything changes.""""The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome.""",277,17
10572,A Clash of Kings,NickReads,461,1208,5,"September 6, 2019","You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!I HAVE NO WORDS,just as the first one,perfection.After Game of Thrones ending,with the head on the spike and the naked mother of dragons with her dragons in her body,you can imagine my level of excitement.I recall reading this in 6 days,and I am proud about that.For my opinion the first one was better than this,but still this one was almost as enjoyable as the first.My favorite is Daenerys Targaryen,I just like to read about her and the cities she goes.She is a badass hot character and you know I am a sucker for that.The scene with Unsullied was kind of predictable,but still awesome.Also in this one I started to like Jamie,I don't know,I just don't care about the incest anymore,and I am glad I got to see him more as a own character because in the King's Landing he was always in the shadow of Cercei.And the ending,like what the hell was that,the white walkers? I must admit,I got a Walking Dead vibe there.I thought Winter coming would bring like Giants as high as the Night's Watch wall with spikes and stuff,but white walkers in horses? That was like the excitement for Hangover 3(if you know what I mean),but still I am so deep in this series,I can't wait to read the next book(Already read it)*grins*
  Okay so you what you get from reading this:
My favorite thing ever:A great cool character that is totally awesome and cool:The person you always wanted to kill:The second person you always wanted to kill:Dragons:Arya freaking Stark:More Daenerys:I can't recommend this enough:)*Pictures from the review are not mine, I took them mostly from Google images or Tumblr*",272,14

I have to admit I have watched, well own the boxsets, of all the shows up to the current one. I can't watch is because I don't have HBO! But I digress. There really isn't much more that I can say that hasn't already been said etc and so on. I will just add a few excerpts and some pictures and some thoughts. That stuff. I love Jon Snow It seems like he didn't have much in the book. A few of the characters I love didn't have a lot of stuff going on in this book. But they will be back. --->EXCERPT<---The Dothraki named the comet shierak qiya, the Bleeding Star. The old men muttered that it omened ill, but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it first on the night she burned Khal Drogo, the night her dragons had awakened. It is the herald of my coming, she told herself as she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart. The gods have sent it to show me the way.I love Daenerys. --->EXCERPT<---Arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw the dirt under her nails, the scabs on her elbows, the scratches on her hands. Septa Mordane wouldn't even know me. I bet Sansa might, but she'd pretend not to. ""My mother's a lady, and my sister, but I never was.""""Yes, you were. You were a lord's daughter and you lived in a castle, didn't you? And you. . . gods be good, I never. . ."" All of the sudden Gendry seemed uncertain, almost afraid. ""All that about cocks, I never should have said that. And I been pissing in front of you and everything, I. . .I beg your pardon, m'Lady.""I love Arya :-)There really is no point in loving anyone in these books or shows because they all die! I found a lot of the book boring and drawn out. I guess when it's not about the people you really like it's sort of... yawn. I loved how most of the book was about Tyrion. Or it seemed that way to me. I Love Tyrion. Because Tyrion is too cool. and he does this ↓And Brienne finally arrives on the scene. I love her too :-) and Bran to all of you I have loved before and still love, you will all die and I will miss you and I will hate that episode and so forth and so on! and stop killing my damn wolves!

10572,A Clash of Kings,mark monday,"1,619",4955,5,"February 15, 2011","Everyone seems to agree that George R.R. Martin and A Song of Ice and Fire are titans in the genre of Epic Fantasy. True, true. Everyone also seems to agree that the best characters are Tyrion, Arya, and Jon Snow. They are indeed wondrous characters. They are heroes. They fail many times, but in a way they are infallible: they are so incredibly sympathetic, they are always trying to do the right thing, they have kindness & empathy & bravery & loyalty. In fact nearly every voice in the first two novels is of this type: the HERO. Sansa is one exception – however she is a victim, and I found her perspective to be very uncomfortable. But I found the tale of the novel’s other non-hero, barely even an anti-hero, to be particularly compelling: Theon Greyjoy. You’re the bomb, Theon.The kid is an asshole, a smug and irritating asshole. He thinks he’s smarter than everyone else. He makes plans upon plans that seemed based entirely around the idea that because he is thinking these thoughts, they will no doubt occur. He is arrogant beyond belief. He has an annoying, self-pleased smirk whenever another character describes him. He is a rough sex-loving womanizer and he strings girls along. In the first novel, he kicks around a decapitated head like a soccer ball.Favorite Theon part: getting a blowjob while thinking about how awesome his future successes will be. And then he climaxes as he considers how his great deeds will even overshadow those of his dear old dad. What a self-absorbed asshole! I couldn't help but laugh out loud.And yet he has positive qualities too, he’s no cardboard cut-out. He has guilty feelings of loyalty. He is brave and quick-thinking and is no kiss-ass. His rapid response time saves a child's life. Unlike his men, he doesn’t enjoy cruelty or barbarism and actively stops their occurrence. He is thwarted repeatedly and never lets that stop him. He sees no point in the grim vendettas of the old. He is not, as they say, “all bad”. In Theon, perhaps the nurture of the Starks has had some slight impact on the nature of the Greyjoys.I really appreciate that Martin included Theon’s voice because honestly, reading wall-to-wall heroic perspectives is enough to make me want to cut some throats. Theon is an asshole, but he’s the kind of guy I’d love to get a beer with, shoot the shit, and enjoy his various mean-spirited bitching and self-absorbed plans of conquest. He is seriously imperfect, quite unlike most of the other voices in the tale.",196,50
10572,A Clash of Kings,Matthew,"1,219",8681,4,"January 2, 2019","I finished this book on the cusp of New Year's Eve 2018 into 2019. At the time, I was too ready to party so I delayed my review. Now, on January 1st, I am recovered and ready!A solid 4 stars - action, world building, interesting characters, political intrigue, etc.I am not quite sure how this book is so big yet so little happens. Sure, a lot of things do occur, but if you take everyone's individual story line, it's only 3 or 4 chapters spread out over 1000 pages. In addition to this, much of the action is not even the focus of any of the chapters I am not sure they ever had a chapter with Robb Stark in it, but we keep hearing about him and know more about what he is doing than we do about Daenerys who had 3 or 4 chapters specifically focused on her  This is all really more of an observation than a complaint. It was just that as I closed it my first thought was ""so many pages, and I didn't get very far!""I do like the writing - it keeps me engaged throughout. It is a bit rougher than some other fantasy books I have read, but Martin's fantasy world is quite a bit rougher than some other fantasy worlds I have visited. I thought the first book in the series was pretty similar to other fantasy I have ready, but this one definitely upped the violence and sex (and, in my opinion, the raping stared to get a bit out or control and seemed a bit unnecessary even if it was to set an unpleasant tone)I suppose in the end it was a bit cliffhanger-ish, but it is probably more accurate to say that it didn't feel like a complete novel in itself and just left off before the story was complete. I did like the way this was handled, though, and it has left me wanting more. In a few months I will watch season 2 of the show and then follow it up with book 3. ",189,48
10572,A Clash of Kings,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,5,"February 13, 2016","This is the Imp’s hour; this is the Imp’s book. Forget about Dany, and forget about Jon Snow because this is the book where we get to see the true quality of Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion is my favourite character in this series, so I’m somewhat biased in my review. For me, he is the most unique, and original, character that George R.R Martin has written. He is wise beyond his years and has developed an acute perception of things; he knows his own place in the world and he knows exactly what it is. Instead of letting it destroy him, like a lesser man would, he uses it to his advantage. He is often overlooked and drastically underestimated by his family, and players of the game, so when he is thrust into the role of King’s hand he does incredibly well, much to the dismay of all.  This surprises no other more than Tyrion himself. So far he has been given no real opportunity to show the world what he is actually capable of, and when his chance comes he seize it and even comes to relish it. In this, we get to see the worth of the man. He is much more beyond the silver tonged drunkard he initially appeared to be; he is a man of great compassion, but also one who can be ruthless when he has to be. He learns to play the game, and he learns quickly to become its master.  If you look further beyond that you get to see a man who is as fragile as he is wise. But, as ever, he has learned to prevent that from becoming his weakness. He has learnt that love is a necessary facet for man, and he has learnt to use it to his advantage. He loves but one man, his brother Jaimie. No harm can come from that as there is small chance of losing the master swordsman. His lover he keeps in secret so his enemies don’t use her against him; thus, he is not weakened by his need for love in the face of constant rejection. He hides his only weakness.Through all this Tyrion plays the game with a steady hand and take no chances. He learns to succeed over the other schemers and solidifies his place at court. And, if that isn’t enough, he does all this without losing his good nature whilst being in the company of snakes. Indeed, it is only because of his nature and a practical form of honour, that Ned Stark completely lacked, does he do so well in the most dangerous city in Westeros. Well, at least until his farther shows up. Tyrion is great character, and is reason enough to love this series. He is hilarious, wise and brave, but at the same time one of the book’s biggest victims. His revenge thus far has been bitter sweet. I do hope he gets the ending he deserves.

10572,A Clash of Kings,Lisa of Troy,375,2777,5,"January 30, 2023","Book #2 in The Male Soap OperaIn my review of Book #1 in The Game of Throne series (formally called A Song of Ice and Fire), I stated that it was a male soap opera. I stand by that sentiment in Book #2.Now this book is an epic fantasy. It is massive! To get through this, I practiced immersion reading, listening to the audiobook while following along in a copy of the text. The audiobook was 30 hours. This is important when reviewing the book because I think I would have had a vastly different experience if I just read the book. The narrator was amazing! And the storytelling was excellent. Never did I feel like reading this book was a chore, and I genuinely looked forward to reading this book. To me, storytelling is the most important element, so I am going to rate A Clash of Kings 5 stars.The book rotates between different perspectives. My favorite perspective was Tyrion who is a person of short stature, and he must rely on his wits, not his strength. There were a couple of times that things didn’t look so great for Tyrion, but he had the upper hand.My least favorite characters were probably Jon (not that much happened) and Daenerys (this character seemed a bit removed from the narrative thread, and her storyline seems to be dropped at times).George R.R. Martin includes some of my favorite themes like the perseverance of underdogs, and I like how he has clearly invented a rich world full of history, language, religion, and traditions. However, he doesn’t get too lost in the world building, providing just enough to move the plot along and keep things interesting. Again, storytelling is the most important thing with me, but there were a few elements that caused me pause.First, good grief! The introduction. Recently, I have been watching a YouTube series by Brandon Sanderson, and someone asked him, “How long is too long for an introduction?” He responded that it depends on how famous the author is, and I started to laugh. Because the introduction to A Clash of Kings is 1 hour long! One hour. And it was really confusing. I felt so much better when the book began, and I recognized a character and didn’t feel completely out of sorts.Secondly, I was having this internal debate (and now I guess it’s external) about which characters are most interesting. Two of the characters who really interest me are King Robb and Lord Tywin (Tyrion’s father). However, we don’t rotate to their perspectives. Does anyone know if there are other books which cover these two perspectives?Third, there are just a touch too many characters. At the end of the book, George R.R. Martin has lists of characters. There are about 20 pages of characters……20! At times, a minor character would make an appearance, and I would go, “Who is that?”Even though I just read 30 hours of this book, I already want to read the next one! Food for thought: There are some great quotes in A Clash of Kings. The hardcover version that I have is gorgeous but at times I wish that I had a digital copy so that I could highlight and share the quotes.Connect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook Insta",150,13
10572,A Clash of Kings,Candace,"1,174",4129,4,"May 15, 2016","Whew! Another one down. These have got to be some of the longest audiobooks that I've ever listened to. Yet, despite the length, I cannot pull myself away from this series. I am completely hooked on this sordid and gory saga.The second book in the series, 'A Clash of Kings' picks up the story and submerges readers in action and adventure. With all of the new kings coming forward to lay claim to different lands and all of the battles, I found myself again, lost at times. There are so many moving parts and so many characters that it was hard to keep track of everything at times.Although the storyline continues to be very complex and multifaceted, I have immensely enjoyed the evolution of the storyline and characters. Tyrion especially has grown on me, in spite of his horrible family. He seems to be the only one in his family that isn't entirely despicable. Thank goodness that he is doing damage control or his wicked sister and her depraved spawn would bathe the streets in blood.With Robb growing his army day by day, he is getting closer to avenging the death of Eddard. Deals are made that will, no doubt, prove to be influential later in the story. In truth, I'm growing a bit impatient waiting for him to storm Joffrey's castle. Meanwhile, with multiple stories running parallel to one another, I have been completely absorbed in this book, waiting for the next little piece of each story. Dani and her dragons find themselves in a perilous situation. There are huge changes in Winterfell with Bran. New kings are coming out of the woodwork. Arya struggles to survive under the guise of an orphan boy. Things that go bump in the night are proving dangerous near the north wall. Without a doubt, there is plenty of danger and adventure to keep your head spinning.Overall, I continue to be engrossed in this epic tale. It is brutal and grim, but I'm loving every minute. The narration is done superbly, but it is still a tough audiobook for me to follow. There are just so many moving parts with this story that I've had to rewind a few times to keep up with what is going on. I highly recommend this series to anyone that loves action/adventure. I'm on to book 3 now.",147,67

Peter Dinklage brought so much charm to the character, but in the book his constant obsession with his cock, plus the way he talks about Shae 
  Bron: ""Fuck you Dwarf""Tyrion: ""That's Shae's job.""
, is really unpleasant to read.Still, I can't deny this story is addictive. It's a combination of rich world-building and great dialogue that makes it work so well, I think. I'm scared for Theon's chapters in the next book, though...",131,5

Each one was as large as a man’s head; when they fell they sent up great gouts of water, smashed through oak planking, and turned living men into bone and pulp and gristle. All across the river the first line was engaged. Grappling hooks were flung out, iron rams crashed through wooden hulls, boarders swarmed, flights of arrows whispered through each other in the drifting smoke, and men died…”-	George R.R. Martin, A Clash of KingsWhen I picked up George R.R. Martin’s Thrones, the first installment in his Song of Ice and Fire cycle, I had tempered expectations. That is to say, I really did not have any expectations at all. I’d watched the first ten minutes of the Game of Thrones television series and was intrigued enough by an early decapitation to try the first book. A Game of Thrones was good in a way I had not expected. Never much for fantasy, I discovered instead a fascinating world of complex characters, unique weather patterns, and a social system besieged by its own tangled history. Yes, there were hints of magic that eventually became explicit, but there was also a tactility and earthiness to the proceedings. This was a book that took J.R.R. Tolkien’s tropes and did awful, terrible things to them. About halfway through A Game of Thrones, a strange thing happened. I looked up and discovered I was hooked. I knew I was going to need the next volume right away. So I ordered it online. Now, I should add, this was back in the day before free two-day shipping. Thus, when I finished A Game of Thrones, I did not yet have A Clash of Kings in my grubby hand. This led to that quintessential junkie’s moment, when you realize your stash is gone and your wallet is empty. I needed to continue the journey – and nothing else could fill that void. I tried reading a slim piece of literary fiction by Stuart O’Nan, but the stakes were too low. I tried reading a biography about George Washington, but all I wanted to do was learn more about the Mad King Aerys Targaryen.It was a strange fate, to suddenly need something that, only shortly before, I did not know existed. The withdrawal symptoms hit me hard. I started refusing to eat anything that wasn’t skewered. I would only take liquids from a flagon, and those liquids had to be wine. I went to a Ren Faire and bought a sword – a sword! – and then I practiced with it, as though I were Syrio Forel, the First Sword of Braavos.When the book finally came, it was like being a kid again, when reading was brand new and everything was unexpected and wonderful. My heretofore nonexistent expectations were suddenly cloud-high. (I should note here that plot-points for A Game of Thrones must necessarily be discussed). The thing about George R.R. Martin, though, is that he does not care about your expectations. When A Game of Thrones ended, King Robert was gone, as was his Hand, Ned Stark, the man most thought would be our main hero. Robert’s “son” Joffrey, actually the product of incest between the brother-sister tandem of Jaime and Cersei Lannister, is now king. Due to Joffrey’s perceived illegitimacy, however, there is a scramble for the throne, with Robert’s two brothers (Renly and Stannis), the lord of the Iron Islands (Balon Greyjoy), and the now-Lord of Winterfell (Robb Stark), all vying for the seat of power (which is constructed of melted swords). Rather than hopping right back into the machinations, Martin begins – as is his tendency – with a prologue starring unfamiliar characters in an unfamiliar setting. Here, that character is Stannis Baratheon’s maester, a man concerned about his lord’s newfound religiosity. Once that throat clearing is done, Martin leads us back to the story left dangling at the end of A Game of Thrones. Ned Stark’s young, tomboyish daughter Arya, is led north by the ranger Yoren, disguised as a boy joining the Night’s Watch. Arya’s dimwitted sister Sansa is held captives by the Lannisters, and is subjected to brutal torments at the hand of Joffrey. In Stannis-land, the smuggler-turned-knight Davos watches uncertainly as his king falls under the spell of a priestess who serves the Lord of Light. Theon Greyjoy, the Stark’s ward from, returns to the land of his father, in preparation for an invasion of the north. All the while, the widowed wife of Khal Drogo, Daenerys, wanders the desert with her dwindling band of blood-riders and three dragons, birthed at the end of A Game of Thrones.This is a summary that just scratches the surface of the overall plot. There is a lot going on, and Martin spends a great deal of time methodically putting his pieces into place, which often requires long journeys larded with dense expositions on various houses, their interlocking loyalties, and the burdens of the past that weigh upon them all. The first time I read this, it all became a bit much. It is easy to get confused, especially if you don’t watch the show (which provides a streamlined and more-manageable version). Even rereading, knowing where it’s all going to go (at least, knowing how the show and the last book Martin has published ends), it requires concentration to keep all it all straight (though Martin does a decent job of giving you little nudges to help you recall how all the characters intertwine). As with A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings is written in the third-person limited style, with alternating chapters from the viewpoint of nine characters, not including the prologue. Most are returning, though we are introduced to new blood in the person of former-smuggler Davos Seaworth (Martin loves his aptronyms!). Having read through the entire series several times now, it is interesting to go back and attempt to discuss these characters objectively, since they have become like old friends (even the bad ones). Tyrion was great from the jump, but others, such as the self-righteous Catelyn Stark, the dull damsel-in-distress Sansa Stark, and the utterly disconnected Daenerys Targaryen, are simply not that pleasant or fun (though they evolve with time). The alternating viewpoints serve an important purpose by defining the boundaries of the story and limiting its scope. Without confining the novel to nine narrators, the plot would simply explode like an overloaded blender. I totally understand why Martin has chosen to craft A Song of Ice and Fire in such a matter. That being said, the structure has severe drawbacks. I first noticed these drawbacks in A Game of Thrones, but I was so dazzled and under the spell of discovery I didn't really care. In A Clash of Kings, they become more noticeable. As is often the case, once I started noticing, I couldn’t stop. First off, let it be said that A Song of Fire and Ice is filled with awesome characters. In the first volume, I loved the bluff and blustery King Robert, the sly, ever-shifting Varys, the charismatic Kingslayer, Jaime Lannister, and the silver-tongued Baelish. In A Clash of Kings, some of these surviving characters, such as Varys, have important roles. Others, such as Jaime Lannister, almost disappear. Meanwhile, new figures spring up in supporting roles. (Such as the mysterious Jaqen H’ghar, who speaks in the third person and is very particular in the promises he makes). Unfortunately, the best characters (in my opinion), the ones who glitter with the most wit and inventiveness, disappear for long periods of time. In their place we are stuck with the nine men, women, and children chosen by Martin to convey his epic tale, but who are hampered with some serious liabilities. Sansa, who spends the whole book as a captive, is a cipher. In the first book she was in love with Joffrey because the plot forced her to be in love with Joffrey, so that she would have a motivation to unwittingly betray her father. In the second book, she’s no longer in love, but she’s just as dimwitted. She keeps getting beaten for saying stupid things, but that doesn’t stop her from continually saying stupid things. The counterargument to this critique is that Sansa is just acting as any thirteen-year-old child. In that case, it is valid to question why Martin felt the need to have children shoulder the burden of an adult story. (As I mention in my review of Fire and Blood, Martin displays certain weird predilections in his novels that show up so often they form a disturbing pattern). The character deficits are underscored by Martin’s decision to highlight indirect, rather than direct action. Because his story is told through only nine characters, you end up looking at the wide world of Westeros as though through a pinhole. You only learn what is before the faces of these nine people. Thus, there are huge swatches of the story you never witness firsthand. You never learn much about Renly Baratheon or Tywin Lannister, except when the main characters come into contact with them. Everything you find out about Stannis comes from the perception of Davos, who often as not is not in Stannis’ presence. The viewpoint characters, oddly enough, often seem to exist only to tell us what more important characters are doing. The ultimate consequence of Martin’s narrative style is that much of the action in the first two-thirds of Kings is hearsay. It consists of one character telling another character about something that happened. A lot of times, these conversations are really interesting. More often than not, they concern a battle that has been fought off-page. Once this happens three or four times, without any actual battles happening on-page, I started to get annoyed. Allegedly, the land of Westeros was engaged in “the War of the Five Kings.” Unfortunately, I wouldn’t know that, because I’m stuck with Sansa in King’s Landing. Things get more wizardly in this second installment, which I thought might cause me to lose interest (I’m here for the swords and ale, not the magic). The gods are still indifferent, but sorcery has entered the picture. The overarching system is not exactly consistent, but more importantly – for me – is remains grounded, and the drama flows through the characters, not their superpowers. While this was certainly a slower read than I expected, the final third of the novel forgives all sins. There are unexpected plot developments and shocking surprises and twists and turns and some people die and some people don’t and the stakes seem real and there is wildfire and swordplay and a castle siege and a naval battle and enough blood to slake the thirst of any fantasy reader. It is an incredible late-inning surge. When I finished, I was awed by Martin’s genius. All the talking, all the dense plotting, all those wasted pages of Theon receiving oral sex and then hitting on his sister are forgotten as the various storylines collide in an epic manner. Say what you will about Martin, but he knows (or at least, knew) how to make a long-game pay off. A Song of Ice and Fire was originally conceived as a trilogy; in that sense, A Clash of Kings is the perfect middle book. It delivers a damn fine action sequence while leaving the main characters in precarious cliffhanger situations. In that way, it’s a bit like The Empire Strikes Back, right down to the weird brother and sister stuff.Unlike The Empire Strikes Back, however, it does not have a lofty reputation. Indeed, it tends to be a bit forgotten. It lacks the freshness and air of originality of A Game of Thrones. And though it neatly avoids the morass of irrelevancies and dead-ends found in A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons, it pales before the masterpiece that is A Storm of Swords. Still, it is a worthy entry, if only for its showcasing of how to effectively set up a big sequence, and then allow it to pay off. This is a feature sadly lacking in this series’ later entries.",119,12
