13642,A Wizard of Earthsea,Ursula K. Le Guin,fantasy,"['Fiction', 'Young Adult', 'Classics', 'Science Fiction Fantasy', 'Magic', 'High Fantasy']",4.01,"January 1, 1968",183,"['Lewis Carroll Shelf Award', 'Boston Globe-Horn Book Award', 'ZÅ‚ota Sepulka', 'Margaret A. Edwards Award']","Ged, the greatest sorcerer in all Earthsea, was called Sparrowhawk in his reckless youth. Hungry for power and knowledge, Sparrowhawk tampered with long-held secrets and loosed a terrible shadow upon the world. This is the tale of his testing, how he mastered the mighty words of power, tamed an ancient dragon, and crossed death's threshold to restore the balance.","Ursula K. Le Guin published twenty-two novels, eleven volumes of short stories, four collections of essays, twelve books for children, six volumes of poetry and four of translation, and has received many awards: Hugo, Nebula, National Book Award, PEN-Malamud, etc. Her recent publications include the novel Lavinia, an essay collection, Cheek by Jowl, and The Wild Girls. She lived in Portland, Oregon.She was known for her treatment of gender (The Left Hand of Darkness, The Matter of Seggri), political systems (The Telling, The Dispossessed) and difference/otherness in any other form. Her interest in non-Western philosophies was reflected in works such as ""Solitude"" and The Telling but even more interesting are her imagined societies, often mixing traits extracted from her profound knowledge of anthropology acquired from growing up with her father, the famous anthropologist, Alfred Kroeber. The Hainish Cycle reflects the anthropologist's experience of immersing themselves in new strange cultures since most of their main characters and narrators (Le Guin favoured the first-person narration) are envoys from a humanitarian organization, the Ekumen, sent to investigate or ally themselves with the people of a different world and learn their ways.",776,22.9k,13291,288041,"['107721 (37%)', '102012 (35%)', '57625 (20%)', '14920 (5%)', '5763 (2%)']"
