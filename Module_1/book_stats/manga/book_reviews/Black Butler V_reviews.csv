He cracks me up!I know I've said it before, but it bears repeating... one of my favorite things about this series is that you never know if Ciel and Sebastian are good guys or bad guys...because they're a little bit of both depending on what's going on. I love it! I can't wait to see how the series ends! (well, I can, because the more the better :-p but you know what I mean)Anyway, pictures! Oh man, there was some sexy ones of Sebastian. I want to put up a picture of Agni because he is sexy too, but I haven't really found one I REALLY like of him. They're all sexy... but the ones I save of Sebastian are the ones that literally make me go ""God he's sexy!"" while I'm reading. Haha!!So, here are some sexies of Sebastian and one of Prince Soma!

Just for standing there, looking good.As for this storyline, mmm, not so much.Part of the problem is that it has been so long since I read volume 4, I couldn't really remember these characters very well. The curry contest was fun, but it seemed a little too ""light"". I would have rather had something a bit darker for plot. I found the Indian guests getting a bit tiresome after a while.Nice to get a little bit of background on the inept servants. I've been wondering why they don't just fire them.",9,2

7663586,Black Butler V,Iryna *Book and Sword*,430,680,4,"February 2, 2019","4.5/5 starsYet another strong installment! I am very happy with the way this manga is going. I thought that maybe they were going to keep solving murder after murder in every episode (which would have gotten boring very quickly), but the cast is growing - there are different cultures, personalities, traditions, back stories and I am digging it all! Volume 5 was also very funny, and we still have our gorgeous prince Soma and his Agni. The only person I really dislike is Ciel! Yes, I know he's so tragic. But he's spoiled, rude and bratty, and honestly I've had enough of him. Too bad he's the main character. Ha ha. I also loved that we finally got hints (very obvious ones) about the true nature of the 3 of the most useless house help characters ever created! I have high hopes for the next volume!

7663586,Black Butler V,Rachel Kathryn Wright,408,16,5,"March 11, 2021","4.5 ‚≠êÔ∏èThis one was better than the previous volume because there was more to the plot and the new characters became more interesting. Especially the backstories we hear for characters like Soma. I also liked the heartedness that was in this story which mostly came from the new characters. Overall, I enjoyed this story especially with it including more cultures and traditions.",3,N/A
7663586,Black Butler V,Kelsey Hanson,866,32,3,"December 13, 2015","I have never tasted curry before in my life, but now I feel oddly compelled to try it after reading this. I am kind of glad that the ""Curry competition arc"" is over just because cooking curry doesn't have nearly as much excitement as tracking down Jack the Ripper. Still it was nice to see Soma finally make some realizations about himself. ",3,N/A

7663586,Black Butler V,Sibil,"1,262",61,5,"September 30, 2019","This volume left me with a craving for curry. Really! And we get to see the Queen, at last! And she's just fantastic! I love her in this series, and I hope to see more of her in the next volumes.But curry and Queen apart, we see even more about the Prince's growth and how, in the end, he manages to bond with Ciel. My little one is making friends, yay! It's really moving! ",2,N/A

7663586,Black Butler V,K.,932,70,3,"June 16, 2017","Excuse me while I nitpick this translation, but Victoria's husband Albert was a Prince Consort, not king. It's a very important distinction re: power dynamics within the Court and the relationship. Maybe I should bug Duo-La to translate a raw copy of this panel for me so I can know who fucked it up. someone is WRONG on the internet and must be brought to JUSTICEahem, anyway. We establish in this volume that English people fuck up curry on the regular due to their bland palates. Sebastian eventually proves himself as ""one hell of a butler"" with the cunning use of chocolate and pageantry. Sebastian has such a high opinion of Ciel, it's so heart-warming.",2,2
7663586,Black Butler V,Ayesha ( Àô‚ñøÀô )	,88,12,1,"December 24, 2021","On one hand, the mangaka has clearly done a lot of research into Indian culture. From the exploration of the art of curry making to Soma eating without cutlery with his right hand to the intricate embroidery on his clothes, the attention to detail is incredibly impressive.On the other hand, colonialism. The scene where deprived Indians try to pick a fight and are depicted as savage thugs was uncomfortable to read. The finale with Sebastian (a British representative) triumphing against Agni (an Indian) by creating a British twist on curry just seems to reinforce colonialist ideologies. Even the commentary throughout the volume praising Queen Victoria's glorious reign of taking over other countries is just....no. I understand that we're viewing the story from Ciel's POV aka someone loyal to Queen Victoria and Britain as a whole. However, this is not a volume I enjoyed reading.",2,N/A
7663586,Black Butler V,Ladiibbug,"1,545",61,4,"January 27, 2015","#5 Black Butler series - MangaPrince Soma's superhuman butler, Agni, and Sebastian confront each other in a terrific battle ... of curry making. The winner of this high-stakes cook-off receives the coveted Royal Warrant.As usual the bumbling household staff causes turmoil, while Sebastian toils relentlessly to perfect his curry making skills. The manor's demented chef, Baldo, once again uses his flamethrower to prepare dinner, with the expected results, LOL. I reread #1 quickly and see that Mr. Tanaka, the elderly man who appears often in the background, saying only ""Ho Ho Ho!"" is the House Steward. He seems to have no duties whatsoever ;-). ",2,N/A
