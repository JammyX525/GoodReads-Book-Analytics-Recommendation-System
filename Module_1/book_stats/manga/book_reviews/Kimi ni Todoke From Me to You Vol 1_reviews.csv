6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Nicole,707,1732,4,"March 11, 2021","Once again, manga proves to be the only pure romance thing i can stomach. This is so cute and adorable! I know I'll be reading the whole thing already! I started this because it's so familiar (seeing it everywhere) I thought it was a new movie adaptation (turned out an anime series -is that what they call it?). However, I'm not sure I'll watch the anime, depends on later volumes. The characters are so naive and innocent. I'm sure if it was a novel, I would've criticized them to no end but manga is like a different world. It's so sweett!! This is so adorable after reading 12 volumes:The manga is still awfully cute but it's too slow, not much progress. I love the characters. I haven't gotten back to it in months, though... I might continue it later when I'm in the mood for shoujo but that won't be any soon.",63,7
6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Liz,600,506,3,"October 19, 2015","When I started the manga/ After the first chapters: Honestly, this is the first manga that made me go through such an emotional rollercoaster. There are not many books that made me feel so much in general...Sawako is a girl nobody understands, her smile is creepy and she is stiff and everybody avoids her. Everybody except Kazehaya, who is the perfect opposite of Sawako (or Sadako how her classmates call her) on the first gaze. He is always smiling and always positive. Kazehaya is the first person who understands Sawako and her optimistic and helpful character and soon Sawako finds more friends. Friends she never thought she would have...Coming back to my thoughts and feelings about this manga (I read 15 Volumes already)... This were my main feelings while reading Kimi ni Todoke:I recommend it to everyone *sniff* who loves mangas *sniff* or who wants to read a good manga just for fun... *tries to calm down* Read it... Just read it... God, this manga is just so awesome!",37,4
6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,2,"February 20, 2019","Sawako Kuronuma is a lonely schoolgirl, ostracised for looking like Sadako, the creepy girl from The Ring movies. Then one day popular boy Kazehaya starts talking to her and her classmates see her in a different light. Um… that’s it?It’s amazing that for a book with so little going on that the story is stretched into a series! It’s like Japanese manga isn’t allowed to tell a done-in-one story – everything’s gotta be a serial, no matter what! And there is almost nothing happening. People are scared of Sawako. Kazehaya talks to Sawako. She’s amazed. Repeat for 200+ pages and then slap a completely unnecessary “To Be Continued…” on it! I thought it’d be a cute romance, and the unusual horror angle seemed promising, but unfortunately Karuho Shiina’s first volume of From Me To You just kept putting me to sleep. And they’re likeable characters too, Sawako and Kazehaya – I’m rooting for them, I hope they get together. But, jeezum crow, this mega-slow treatment of their story killed me! Not everything has to be a series goddammit – just tell the story, stop treading water the whole time! ",34,4
6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Jay,514,370,5,"March 10, 2015",Super cute and fun shoju manga. I loved volume one and none of the insta-love present. It is more about friendship at the moment and I really appreciate that. I love the art and the high school setting too. ,14,2
6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1, Athena Ivashkova ~♥~,129,5,5,"June 30, 2013","Here's the thing:I didn't want to read this manga after so many friends of mine recommended this to me. It's just...the cover isn't that appealing. And my motto will always be ""judge a book by its cover"". You see this, don't you? Maybe it's just me. Furthermore, I'll give you a list of the regular cultures in a manga that I admire little to none.1. DAMN YOU, SEXISMIt's no lie, if you are a big shoujo reader, you would always observe that the male(love-interest),is always better than the protagonist no matter what. Of course; education is involved, martial arts is involved, or looks, etc. The superficial stuff. Superficial elements like these in a manga that can corrupt a potential plot. 2. Pathetic, petty protagonistsSo what is the difference between novels and mangas? In novels, you can easily track down an ass-kickin' protagonist, a bad-ass one, or simply, the kind that can function his/her brain. In mangas (shoujos in general), it's rare, very rare to find one that can control a situation on her own. It's very sad, to just have a story about a bland girl who lets a guy have his way with her. 3. Will the climax always occur when the 2 lust-birds are in bed together? (hehe...the climax...)That always does not happen (unless your're reading a mature one). I never mean to sound biased, but you would see this occur a lot. There's just no development. Most shoujo mangas are romance-based. Some are pretty good, others...not so much. Boy meets girl. Boy hates girl. Girl prods boy (or pretends she hates him). Girl stares at boy when he's not looking. Boy would abuse her emotionally or physically (or both). Girl does her stupid blushes. To one point where boy pushes girl against the wall and declares his love. Girl just stares at boy; wide-eyes, brimming with tears and mouth wide open. Boy kisses girl (or can go above and beyond). Boy and girl gets HEA. 4. Abhorring jackasses and ENDLESS ANGST~*~*~*~*~And then I've read this gem. I just read it with no coherent reason, but bland curiosity. And I'm so glad, so so glad I did. This is how a manga should be made, it's the way how it should be done. You have a girl:an anti-social, smart nobody high-school girl. Does this contradicts with my previous viewpoints? Umm, no. Her reputation have been this way as a child. Her long, black hair and pale skin resembles a frightening character from a scary movie. The charcter's name is Sadako. But her real name is Sawako. And let me tell you: she is such a sweetheart. This is her motto:
  Do one good deed each day
 (Idk if it's ""one"" but I think that's correct)She tries to make friends, tries to smile, but everyone is just so frightened of her.Now the boy! His name is Kazehaya (I call him Kaze), and he's the most popular boy in high-school for his charisma and courtesy. He's also sweet, as sweet as Sawako. He befriends her, and he boosts her self-esteem about herself. Because of him, she has the motivation to make friends, boosten herself as a person. Even though he's popular, he's not afraid of being humble or asking for help. He even asks her if she can help him on a school subject. Ohhhhhh! I just love the friendship, the fluffiness of this manga! I love it to death! So for this, you have my recommendation, wholeheartedly.",11,11
6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,daph pink ♡ ,877,3016,2,"January 12, 2023","Given the extraordinary high ratings for this series, I find it difficult to grasp what makes it special. I may have only read the first volume, and subsequent volumes get better. The same sunshine boy, gloomy female theme, and some friends around them, in my opinion, make the story repetitive. Perhaps rom-coms aren't for me.",10,2

6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Meherin ST,10,19,5,"February 12, 2021",I saw the anime. Also read the manga. It was a nice and fresh watch. One of the bests in the category.,10,N/A
6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Lauren,801,931,3,"September 16, 2018","3.5 starsAlthough I did really enjoy the art style and the cute dynamic between Kazehaya and Sawako, I found the storyline pretty repetitive. Basically Sawako (aka Sadako) is ostracised by her classmates because of the way she looks (resembles the typical ‘horror film’ girl) and because they think she attracts ghosts/can curse people. But she’s just a normal schoolgirl who really wants to make friends with everyone she meets. And it’s only through Kazehaya’s recognition and inclusion of her that gradually the others start to speak to her. Personally, I had a few issues with this manga: 1) - Sawako is only accepted because of Kazehaya’s association with her. 2) - Sawako states that everyone is so nice because they talk to her (due to the above) 3) She is constantly “overwhelmed” by the above4) She lets them use her (helps explain things in class to them) and feels good about it! I really don’t like how Sawako is used by her classmates, and her wanting to please everyone all the time becomes tiresome. They should want to befriend Sawako because she is a lovely person, not because Kazehaya isn’t afraid of interacting with her nor because she helps them with their classwork. I would like to read the next couple of volumes to see if this changes but I won’t be purchasing any more (hopefully I can loan these from the library) as I’m uncomfortable with the messages projected in this opening volume.

  I'm avoiding any spoilers for the manga itself, however I plan to use gifs from the anime to express myself better. If you're anything like me and prefer to start and discover the anime by yourself without any spoilers or too many reveals of particular moments, click away now. :)
Meet Sawako Kuronuma:Also known as 'Sadako', named after the creepy girl from The Ring.Now meet Shota Kazehaya:They seem like the complete opposite of each other, right?Wrong.Sawako Kuronuma is a sweet, shy girl constantly associated to a girl from a Japanese horror movie trying to make friends in her first year of high school.Greet as often as she might, she's feared and is therefore very lonely.Enter Kazehaya, the lovable, popular high school guy that no one can get enough of. Through just one simple act of choosing to sit next to her during a seat change in Homeroom:He changes Sawako's world. This first volume includes an introductory chapter, the prologue in which we meet the two main characters and learn of Sawako's dilemma. It occurs during the final semester before Summer break and ends in misunderstanding (which is a recurring theme in this series).Ensue more chapters of cuteness. Yano, Yoshida, Ryu and Pin are also introduced in this volume however the focus isn't on them but more about helping the readers settle in with the story. All in all, this volume was a fantastic introductory volume to the series. We are introduced to the characters, the romance isn't significant yet and there's much we learn about Sadako's character. We're also introduced to a rival character in the final chapter which is pretty cliffhanger-y because this character is not formally introduced yet.The art, the front cover and the background panels are superbly presented.Like most manga, this one also has its author panels where Karuho Shiina introduces herself and tells the readers about the making of manga.I have now opted to read these panels after finishing the volume since I find they take me away from the story. I guess, this aspect is unique to manga where readers, (especially non-japanese readers) get to learn a little about real Japanese culture and can connect to the author in a personal way.I may or may not have forgotten what the author wrote in her panels. I think they're great to flick back to for anyone who actually owns the manga since they have very little to do with the story itself.This manga series is fluffy but not the try-hard kind; it has a running theme of deep character development and it's all very 
  natural.
 I guarantee your face being plastered with a goofy smile throughout. expect some tearjerking scenes too pls",7,N/A

6218007,Kimi ni Todoke From Me to You Vol 1,Jane (It'sJaneLindsey),446,520,2,"February 26, 2019","I think that I maybe just didn’t “get” this, because so many people have rated it highly and I don’t understand why? The story of this first volume is incredibly repetitive to the point of being boring, and I would have liked there to be MORE, in terms of plot and characterization and conversations. Every scene just felt like a repeat of the one before, so that I finished this installment confused as to what the point is, or how any conflict is expected to propel the story forward. Unfortunately, I simply didn’t enjoy this and won’t be continuing with the series.",6,N/A
