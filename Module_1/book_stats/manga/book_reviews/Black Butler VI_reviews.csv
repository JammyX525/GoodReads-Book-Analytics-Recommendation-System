7759872,Black Butler VI,Yvensong,871,50,4,"December 23, 2014","I find, as I read further into the series, that I am appreciating the tiny notes and nuances more and more, even though they are difficult to read with these old eyes. They are like the fine lines in a piece of artwork. You can enjoy the work of art without studying the the parts that make up the whole, yet the elegance of those parts are worth noting. This volume takes us out of the streets of London and into the internal life of a circus. A circus that may hold the key to several missing children. The Queen has requested that her watchdog - Earl Ciel Phantomhive -- finds those children, and that he brings them home safely.Ciel and his Demon Butler soon learn that the only way they can investigate the circus properly is by joining it.It is quite entertaining to watch Sebastian show off his many talents, and even more so, watching the young Earl attempt to fit into circus life as a commoner. Secrets are revealed, leading to more questions, and a grim reaper tries to foil Sebastian's every move. Will our two heroes survive poisonous snakes, the trapeze, and badly peeled potatoes? ",8,4

7759872,Black Butler VI,Sibil,"1,262",61,5,"September 30, 2019","In this one the arts are fantastic, amazing, beautiful, gorgeous! With this volume start the part of the story about the Circus, and it's an amazing part, full of new characters (and all of them are drawn so well *_*) and with a new plot, a new mystery to unravel. And we have some potential for something really creepy. I loved this first part, the introduction to the circus and to his inhabitants, and now I need to know more. Snake and Joker are my favorites, so far, but I really hope to learn more about them all. Ad we met someone from the past, too! I simply can't wait to see what would happen next! ",2,N/A
7759872,Black Butler VI,Alexxy,375,60,3,"November 5, 2018","Sometimes I really wish I could unwatch the anime so that I would enjoy the manga more. I love circuses and circus-themed books are my guilty pleasures. I also did love the third season of the anime (the circus related one) a lot. Its just that, knowing everything that's going to happen really spoils the fun of reading. Still, the art was breath taking and Sebastatian and Ciel were as amazing as always.Now, on to the chapter to chapter analysis. Contains spoilers Chapter 24 → ◙ A moving circus and children disappearing at the same time. Definitely suspicious.◙ Undertaker made an appearance. He's such a mysterious character. I hope one day we'll get to know about him more.Chapter 25 → ◙ A prosthetic circus. Huh (I've kind of forgotten about this little bit here)◙ I really like that they had to join the circus for their investigation. Ciel struggling for the audition and Sebastian helping him was specially hilarious. I mean look at everyone's shocked faces here.  ◙ That's right. I never noticed that Ciel doesn't smile much. Poor kid.Chapter 26 → ◙ More of a filler chapter. We find out about 'suit'. A reaper who, for whatever reason; has also joined the circus.Chapter 27 → ◙ What's the name of the boy rooming with Ciel? Does everyone call him freckles?◙ I wonder what that letter was. I don't remember.◙ 'Suit' is annoying the hell out of me. Freaking irritating thing. *huff*[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",2,1 comment

7759872,Black Butler VI,K.,932,70,4,"June 16, 2017","Ah, the circus. Tightrope walking, fire eaters, knife throwing, dangerous wild anim-oh. So Sebastian and Ciel infiltrate a circus on the Queen's orders in search of a large number of missing children. Ciel has to pass an ""entrance test"" to prove that he is worth taking on and Sebastian, wonder butler that is he, is all too happy to help Ciel keep his balance on the tightrope.And then a wild reaper appears! As quite possibly the world's worst ""spy"". I legit snorted aloud when I saw this panel, though - they look so incredibly horrified to be put together as ""roommates"".Through a pratfall, Ciel's brand is exposed and we're treated to what is essentially a minor panic attack on his part, where he is brought low by the memories of his captors. Sebastian wordslaps him out of it with a few well-chosen phrases needling at the one thing Ciel clings to, his pride as Earl of Phantomhive. I suppose Ciel's soul will be tastier if he is constantly dipped in and out of abject misery, like a nice crusty sourdough with fondue. Gruyere, with some aged cheddar and maybe swiss? Yum.",2,2

DAMN Ciel looks sexy as HELL on the cover XD Haha, thank you Japan for making us all creepers :-pI really liked the circus theme of this volume (and no surprise, the circus crew is a bunch of sexy bitches too). Of course, it had a good balance of seriousness and hilarity that I enjoy while reading this manga series. I can't wait to they all come out in the US and I buy them all so I can read them consecutively instead of months apart waiting for the library copies.****pictures to come soon****",2,N/A
7759872,Black Butler VI,Nerdish Mum,393,29,5,"September 8, 2015","I really enjoyed this book and the art as usual was stunning. I think I'm going to enjoy this story arc within the series, I like the idea of the travelling circus and I look forward to finding out what exactly is going on with the missing children. Sebastian is such a great character, I wish I had a butler like him minus the whole demon thing.",2,N/A
