9625608,Black Butler IX,Rose,182,78,3,"June 22, 2013","Hi again, Black Butler. I'm not sure what kind of relationship this is. I mean, I'm committed to you. I do plan to read you until your writers decide to end it between us but you're just so meh at the moment. You had a few volumes that were fun and that made me want to read the next one immediately. The last few volumes... let's just not talk about them. I don't want to fight, you know, also, if I think about your last few volumes too much I will Zzz away because honestly: so boring. I liked volume 9 way better because of... a feel to it it had. I have to be honest with you, I only liked volume 9 so much more than the circus arc volumes because it was kind of Detective Conan-esque. I know, I know and I'm so sorry but I can't help it, this literally saved our relationship, even though it feels like... I'm cheating? A little more truth: I'd choose Detective Conan over you any day. OK, I think I hurt our relationship more with this than with anything else I said BUT to make you feel better, I'm not going to break up. Your cliffhanger makes me curious to see where our relationship is headed next and I just won't quit you, I promiseÂ¹. Ttyl, Black Butler. Staying Detective Conan-esque will make me very happy, so don't change for the next few volumes, OK?Â¹Don't hold me to that promise, though. I might change my mind.",3,2
9625608,Black Butler IX,Kris Ritchie,"1,464",14,3,"July 17, 2020","This volume largely concerns the beginnings of a Sherlock Holmes style mystery, with Doyle even appearing as a character in the story. It's an ok arc start, but I really enjoyed the circus arc so it did not beat that yet.",2,N/A
