8045163,Black Butler VIII,Miss Ryoko,"2,591",120,5,"January 3, 2015","Not gonna lie, I'm totally giving this volume a 5 star rating simply because of this:
  
OMG that is so many levels of bad ass I can't even begin to describe it!!! The first chapter of this volume kicked so much ass I was about ready to jump out the window from the sheer awesomeness of it all! The rest was good too...but seriously, that first chapter has probably been my favorite in this entire series so far.I really like the reapers! William is righteous, Grelle is AMAZING, and the new one that showed up, Ronald, seems pretty awesome.But what is it about the dudes in this series? We all know Toboso-sensei is great at drawing men...but does she honestly have a ""All the dudes I draw need to be studs"" rule or what? Because seriously, they're always sexy in some way. Its ridiculous! LOL.... but Sebastian is the studliest of them all (no doubts about that).Anyway, this volume was pretty awesome! I really love this series!",24,2
8045163,Black Butler VIII,Kaitlin,73,17,4,"October 4, 2013","Holy shit...THAT sure took a dark turn!The beginning was filled with action right away. It starts with the Circus troop attempting their attack on the manor and I must say...DEM SERVANTS! What badasses!BTW: When did Mey-Rin get so hot?Though I really did feel conflicted about everyone in the troop  dying . On one hand, they kind of deserved it, I mean...snatching innocent children and what not. But on the other hand they were rather tragic and emotionally warped characters. The  death  that was the hardest to bare was definitely Doll's. Again, I know she was part of the ring but I really liked her. She was spunky and seemed to have a heart. There was something about her that was redeemable I guess. The author really humanized the troop. You felt their emotions, struggles, hopes & dreams, and thoughts. Maybe this is why it felt so tragic when  they died . I actually felt bad for them! And wanted them to  live .Now I'm going to talk about the big elephant in the room: Ciel.DAFUQ was that?Is it somehow possible that Sebastian, a demon, has more human qualities than an actual human? That little bastard is one warped mofo.Check this shit out:  He totally just  burned those children alive! His reasoning? They were better off  dead . Gah! wtf...He gets even MORE twistedThe look on Sebastian's face says it all... Sebastian and Ciel are at the workhouse to see if there are any children there and when they find nothing he has a fit of the giggles, laughing at the troop's pain. WOO BOY. This manga is sure getting dark! There is however several comedic characters. You've got the servants and Prince Soma/Agni. I also find the grim reaper William to be a more subdued relief from all the drama. I'm very interested to see how his character will play out as the series continues!

8045163,Black Butler VIII,Ozan ,89,47,5,"January 16, 2018","The Circus adventure was very good. The Second time the manga really imperesed me.These words from Ciel really made me think: ''You Fought to protect your own world, there is nothing wrong with that. After all, the justice in this world is a sham created by those in power for themselves. No one gives a damn about anyone else. If you are careless, you are sure to lose. To begin with only two kinds of humans existed in this world. Those who rob and those who are robbed. And today, i shall rob you and your allies of your futures. That's all there is to it.''Ciel PhantomhiveWords of the aristocrat of evil. Not bad for a shouta, Pretty cool words huh ? Not entierly true though, especially what the circus memebers did to protect their world... That was really wrong... But they were really desperate too... :/ But there is some partly truth to the Ciel's words...",10,6
8045163,Black Butler VIII,Despair Speaking,316,135,5,"August 9, 2012","I'm tired of writing summaries. It's not like anyone reads my reviews so I'll just put my opinion...Wah~ I wish even more that I have a butler like Sebastian! How can he find such awesome people?! Okay, so he's a demon but still!!! Innocent gardener is actually a human experiment. Glasses maid is actually an unparalleled sharpshooter. Idiot cook is actually a demolitions expert. How cool is that!!!The only thing that ruined it for me was when Ciel let the children die and when it turned out the orphanage of a sort Joker and the others were protecting turned out to be a fake. Okay, I understand Ciel's point that those children were kind of hard to save since they were really gone mentally and emotionally but wasn't that too harsh? Although yes, dying might be better than to prolong such miserable lives... Anyway, I can't believe Joker and the others never thought to check that orphanage! I mean, seriously? After all those years, they never bothered to check?! That's retarded!!!Otherwise a good manga. Sebastian reminded me of Ryuk though with the comment, ""And that's why humans are so interesting.""",6,2
8045163,Black Butler VIII,nivedha,138,69,5,"July 21, 2020","ah. so that's why mey rin, finnian and baldroy are so bad at what they do. i did not see that plot twist coming. who would've known that the servants of the phantomhive family were skilled assassins?",6,N/A
8045163,Black Butler VIII,Cornerofmadness,"1,601",9,4,"February 10, 2012","Black Butler rounds out the circus arc and it is an unhappy, angst-fest of a volume. That’s not to say it’s not good, because it is, but it is the darkest thing so far, beating out the Jack the Ripper arc and that’s not an easy thing to do. I think that’s because the Yana does a very good job of making us pity Joker and his crew. The plight of children in Victorian times is about as foreign from today’s views as you can get. Joker and the rest were done practically from the moment they were born deformed and/or injured which was common place in the work houses. The pity only cranks up when its revealed what they were fighting for and the lies they were told.That said, they were doing a very bad thing, luring in children for a deranged noble and even more deranged doctor. Much of the beginning of the story is getting these pathetic details while Joker dies (Sebastian more or less killed him last book, we’re just waiting for him to bleed out). Ciel does find the missing children and more or less loses it as he’s forced to remember his own incarceration by sadists. He loses it to the point of doing something unbelievably drastic. (More on that at the end)In the meantime, the rest of the circus performers attack Ciel’s estate with the intent to kill. We finally get to see what his staff is really capable of. I was sort of hoping it wouldn’t be the ridiculously over the top stuff the anime gave us but it was. I have a few problems with this too (that spoiler also at the end). They protect the estate – and Lady Elizabeth who’s visiting – with lethal force. And the Grim Reapers give one last twist of the knife in showing what shaped the circus crew (though they also felt like the lone untied thread. I wasn’t sure why they were at the circus. To retrieve the souls obviously but I was wondering why they let Sebastian do their dirty work).The final chapter is a bit of silliness that fell a little flat with me. A cross dressing lesbian tailor who is there to make Ciel and Lizzie Easter clothing. She was too over the top to be enjoyable for me, at least. I did like Ciel wanting to shield Lizzie from the brand on his back. The art is gorgeous. The story is sad, good, but sad. It’s becoming more and more a manga I can’t wait to see more of.Now for the spoilers.Seriously, if you haven’t read it you might want to stop now.Okay.So. It’s not that I don’t like the idea of Finney, Baldo and Mey-Rin having hidden abilities. I really love the idea of Finney being a test subject, trained to kill, possessing super strength and the ability to heal. Baldo’s story is less clear in this but he’s obviously military trained. It’s Mey-Rin that bothers me deeply. I have no issue with her being a super sniper. It’s her cover story that makes no sense. Why blind her with glasses? I don’t get it. Maybe it’ll be explained later (and a better one than was in the anime hopefully). Their clumsiness in the jobs they hold at Phantomhive Manor (jobs they are ill suited to and untrained for) is comedy relief but Mey-Rin makes little sense.Ciel’s drastic actions bother me. He was so freaked out he had Sebastian destroy the place with fire with the missing children inside instead of trying to rescue him. To the story’s credit, Sebastian calls Ciel on this later and the boy (and it’s easy to forget he IS a boy) admits his own arrogance in the decision. His belief was living through what they had, the kids would rather be dead. That is arrogant, unsubstantiated and possibly erroneous. He figures that he’s stronger than everyone and since he barely survived a similar torture, then no one else has a prayer of doing the same. Arrogant, yes, showing his true age, yes. I guess I’m sort of hoping that more will be made of this later since he did murder a bunch of innocent kids but I’m thinking this is probably the end to it. I could be wrong.",4,N/A
8045163,Black Butler VIII,Loveliest Evaris,397,69,1,"April 16, 2012","I will NOT, I repeat,  NOT  be continuing this series. After this volume, I've lost all enjoyment in this series.It wasn't that it wasn't good; it was .. I guess.. But Ciel Phantomhive, you have pushed me to Alienation Planet for the last time, and this last time, it was a forceful shove off the cliff into a glass filled pit of anger and hair-pulling. =INITIATING POINTLESS RANT ON CIEL PHANTOMHIVE-I have a love-hate relationship with Ciel Phantomhive. I love him -- but it's a grudging love-- because of the fact that he's a child and I like how he's drawn, because lots of authors make ugly children.. I DESPISE him because of his friggin ARROGANCE, the sheer audacity..I mean, it's probably because he's rich and of an aristocratic family.. and British. British people at the time this series takes place were especially uppity, 100x then they are now.. much like Americans are today... The fact that he has a demon butler that does whatever he says, along with 'pawns' ... the sheer .. urgh! Yeah, he was abused, possibly raped in the ass with the hilt of a dagger, who knows what happened. All I know was he was held down , chained up, and put on an altar , and branded like cattle. That's traumatizing, but God, man, be at least a little GRATEFUL you have your fiancee and your servants who love you unconditionally and want to take care of you and share your burden! Only a biblical figure would have that much gall to think that they were greater than everyone else because they 'suffered the most' and 'experienced the most pain' .. ""you don't even know me, you don't know the pain I feel"" .. well enlighten us! Instead of sitting on your throne with your scowl of boredom, tell us a little bit about your traumatising past? You can't? You throw up at the mere thought of it? Well then get off your high horse, since you obviously don't have a pair to face your past, instead just push in the back of your head and suck on a lemon day in and day out.Maybe it's the whole British 'stip upper-lip' mantra that they quoted day in and day out.. probably because he's in the public eye.. That's all well and good, but you have a thousand rooms in your mansion; you could just lock yourself in one of them and cry... But then again, psychology and child counseling was sh*t back then, so... My ideas would probably be looked at with looks of confusion, surprise, and suspicion.On to my review of this volume: I will say this. My favorite manga characters will usually incorporate one of the following:1) long blond hair2) puppetmastery/puppet skills/ doll-maker 3) glasses (male only)4) snaggle tooth5) Cool costumeJoker fit 2/5 of the five requirements, lol. And I got the doll-maker vibe from him for some reason, even though that's Drocell I'm thinking off (anime only). Maybe it's because I imprinted my infatuation with Drocell onto Joker, since they're a little similar in clothing and looks (not really, but shut up). It was depressing looking at Joker and his troupe-family's past: Discarded for being malformed or unwanted, freaks and the like. And they got their spare parts from a shady dealer, whom they were forever indebted to , along with this other, fatass-ugly-noble whom I don't care about. Joker didn't even know that the prosthetics were made of human bones; Joker is ... what'd you say, an anti-hero? Without the -hero- bit. He was a victim of circumstances, just like everyone else in his circus; they did what they could to survive.Ciel actually remarks upon that, stating in a wannabe-Nietzche fashion, ""Only two types of people in this world: Those who take advantage of others, and those who are taken advantage of."" Wow, that's so black and white. Typical of a snot-nosed 12 year old bratty aristocrat. But I digress.Joker and his 'family' had no other choice BUT to follow the crazy noble's orders. It wasn't that they really did anything malicious... okay they kidnapped children. Those children were probably runaways anyways, or orphans. Not like they just stole them out of the cradle or whatever. Yes those kids were tortured, but it was either them or Joker and Co. Which would YOU choose? I'd say the children. At least they're being put to better use other than chimney-blockers.. Ahem.But Ciel has a freaking mental breakdown and orders Sebastian to kill all the children. This is where I completely shut down. I literally screamed, readers, I screamed this: ""WHAT THE HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Don't worry, it was in the lonely solitary confinements of my room, which I frequently hole myself up in except to eat or piss.. Anyways! And of course, Sebastian, being the shit-eating-smirker that he is, grants his wish. God Sebastian, your smile drives me insane! I hate his smile! It's okay , but after a thousand times his mischievious grin just drives me up the wall with anger! Arrgh.And then Ciel has the gall -again, more gall in this kid's little finger than in the whole cast of Jersey Shore - to say that those kids wouldn't have been able to function properly had he not  set them ablaze--living children-- and 'put them out of their misery'  . Yes Ciel, because letting them taste the fires of Hell in the mortal life is a much better fate than letting them free to possibly, I don't know, band together in the oustide world and comfort each other as fellow victims of horrendous, unspeakable abuse, neglect, and God knows what else..And then after all this stupid angsty-ridden crap, there is this stupid story of fitting Ciel with an Easter dress. Like seriously? Totally unacceptable. 1/5 for that whiplash-transition. But not just a 1/5 just because of that, but because of what is written in the spoiler. I take my leave .____.",3,3
8045163,Black Butler VIII,Laura,"1,018",79,4,"March 17, 2017","http://owltellyouaboutit.com/2012/02/27/black-butler-volume-8/With every volume I read, I become more invested in this series. I love all the characters and all the plot twists. Yana Toboso does such a wonderful job creating a gripping series with beautiful, lush art. The art is just as much a reason to read it as the plot. It’s the best manga art I’ve come across, so far.Following Ciel through his journey has been exciting and sometimes heartbreaking. This was one of those times that it was heartbreaking. Ciel was forced to confront a very painful past. Still, though his surroundings are full of horror, he pulls himself together and does his duty. I never feel sad when Ciel has his moments of weakness. After all, he’s only a child. And Sebastian is always there for him. He may have his own terrible agenda, but it’s hard to dislike him when he is constantly catching Ciel as he falls. Also, he’s so bad ass.This one closed the door on the Noah’s Ark Circus with a definite finality. It looks like there may be some issues with Ciel’s realtionship with the Crown. He veered a little from the plan, and that may come back to bite him. Of course, with Sebastian on his side, I can’t see anyone harming him. The last chapter was a little bit of fluff. It looks like the next volume will begin a fresh story for Ciel.If you haven’t read any of this series, try it out. It’s really awesome. There’s a ton of action and the art is beautiful.",3,N/A
8045163,Black Butler VIII,Alexxy,375,60,3,"November 28, 2018","And finally, in this volume, we wrapped up the circus arc. I will miss the characters a the setting. Farewell! Chapter by chapter musings:Chapter 33 → ♥ ""That... is what it is to be the servants of the Phantomhive family."" Jeez, never would have thought these idiotic lot could be so badass.Chapter 34 → ♦ Hmm, I guess this doesn't really answer the questions I have about Ciel's past _ I have even more of them now_ but it does show how traumatic they have truly been for Ciel and how they have affected him. Poor poor boy...Chapter 35 → ♥ I believe that after all the flashbacks and tragic past reveals that I'm getting in every story, my sens of right and wrong had completely disappeared. I now sympathize with everyone.♥ What the hell is Undertaker doing there -again- and what the heck is he saying?♥ Oooh, the queen's servants. I wonder how the plot is going to be different from the anime -if it's any different, of course.Chapter 36 → ♦ More of a filler chapter. Much talk about the truth of the human nature and a sad, depressing reveal.Chapter 37 → ♥ Lol I don't think 'Nina' was in the anime -or if she was, I don't remember.
