11973550,Black Butler XI,Loveliest Evaris,397,69,4,"April 5, 2013","In this volume I'm reminded how much of a dick Ciel and Sebastian are...to anyone in general.Seriously, I want to slap that boy across the face. With my High-School-Graduation-Ring-hand! And poor Snake. I STILL have not forgotten what Ciel did to Joker and his circus troupe!NEVER. FORGET!But yay, he's so cute anyway...says Goethe.I hope he's a permanent new staple in the Phantomhive manor --says Wilde.Okay I'll stop with the weird referral-to-snakes-as-if-they're-actually-thinking...says Emily.Elizabeth annoys me. I have a disdain for all aristocratic females because 1) They're secluded in their pretty manors so they can't possibly know what hard work is , and 2) They can't possibly know what true pain and suffering is since they're done up like dolls and supposed to act pretty and ladylike.Ugh...Why do I read this manga despite having a strong HATRED for aristocrats? God I would be such good chums with the guerillas during the Revolutionary War. Mwahaha...",7,1 comment

11973550,Black Butler XI,Karissa,"3,865",189,4,"January 2, 2016","This is the 11th volume in the Black Butler series. I have been really enjoying this manga series overall. I thought volume 10 was weaker than the rest of the series. This volume is better again; although not as spectacular as some of the volumes before 10. In this volume the events of the last two volumes are explained in detail with all revealed. Then Ciel and Sebastian end up on a cruise ship with Ciel’s intended. Most of the people think that Ciel is taking a well deserved break but little do they know that really Ciel is following rumors of the Aurora Society, a Society that claims to be able to wake the dead.It was nice to have the events of the previous two volumes explained in detail (I was still a bit confused about why what happened happened in volume 10). I am also happy to have that story line tied up because, while it was very tongue in cheek and somewhat entertaining, I was ready to move on.The last third of this book puts the reader in an interesting place. We are on a cruise ship with a society that claims to be able to raise the dead (oh boy...this scenario is just begging for trouble).It was wonderful to have Sebastian back in the story. The Undertaker is also in the story for the last part of the book (he is one of my favorite characters). The illustration continues to be beautifully done. I really enjoy the high quality and entertainment value of these mangas.Overall an excellent continuation of this manga series. I continue to find this manga series highly entertaining and very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend to those who enjoy Victorian paranormal themes to their manga.",2,3
11973550,Black Butler XI,Yue,"2,102",30,4,"November 6, 2015","Sebastian certainly is weird and vain! His story about the black cat was so funny! He is so crazy about cats... and that he had to show up in his most humiliating appearance when he was 'dead'! hahaha, and he certainly moved a lot during the case; Ciel makes him work so hard. But that scene of Ciel crying over Sebastian's dead body... arghhhh it was just acting :(It was a surprise that Arthur C. Doyle was told the truth; but again, it was a nice twist, showing him then in the future, as the great writer he was.And the appearance of The Snake... I was like WTH! I was so willing to leave that volume behind (everything that relates to the circus). Thank God, so far he is harmless and came to work as a footman in the mansion.Then, the chapters in the ship... Lucky Lizzy, making Ciel happy. Finally Ciel takes a couple of days as holiday, going into a ship with Lizzy's family. It was strange to see Sebastian dress up (or should I say, combed in that way) to enter the society.And then... WTH! The Phoenix Pose! Ciel and Sebastian making the Phoenix Pose! That was so unexpected it was funny. Actually, there are several funny moments in this volume: Viscount Druitt (every one of his scenes are great) flirting with Ciel! Ciel saying Sebastian is his father! And it was great the appearances of the Undertaker, as usual, and a new Reaper, Ronald Know.Next volume: Zombies! This manga is so unexpected.",2,3
11973550,Black Butler XI,Rose,182,78,2,"July 7, 2013","You are getting more and more ridiculous with each volume. Le sigh. Should I just abandon you and find a new manga that will help me boost my Goodreads Reading Challenge or should I stay committed to you? I'll probably keep reading you but it's time to get unfaithful and look for some new and more interesting manga that I can read besides you. Yeah, you heard that right. You know, sometimes you're pretty fun and entertaining, so please get back to your volume 3-5 roots. Back then I still liked you. Quite a lot, actually. And I really don't feel like quitting you now that I've spent so much time with you. But just don't expect me to stay faithful to you because you've just disappointed me so many times already.",2,4
11973550,Black Butler XI,Alexxy,375,60,4,"January 10, 2019","God, I'm starting to hate how the anime ruined the manga for me. I used to think the story was overhyped and not really worth all the attention. But the manga is so good. Like, I'm getting so emotionally involved with these characters it's ridiculous. I just love Sebastian so much, okay?!",2,N/A

11973550,Black Butler XI,Beth,"3,025",13,3,"March 22, 2018","Since I didn't pay much attention to the mystery in the previous books, I wasn't terribly impressed with the chapters telling me that everything I thought I knew (I knew nothing) was wrong. But I like the move onto the cruise at the end, and I'm glad snack-boy is sticking around.",1 like,N/A

And he brings his literary-named ""friends"" ha ha!Ciel assigns Sebastian to investigate disturbing rumors of a local hospital bringing the dead back to life. At the same time, Ciel's fiancé, the ever exuberant ♥✿❀♥♥!! Elizabeth ♥✿❀♥♥!!, announces that Ciel has been invited on a family vacation aboard a luxury passenger liner.Sebastian discovers a strong link to the secret society involved in the hospital/raising the dead scheme - their next meeting is to be held on the maiden voyage of the same liner that Elizabeth's family is booked aboard.Ciel, Sebastian and Snake book passage to investigate. Bizarre, hilarious, and gruesome events ensue.I was glued to the new arc and can't wait to continue with #12!Among Yana Toboso's Author Notes, ""Translations"":*Page 67: ""There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact."" This quote appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Boscombe Valley Mystery, featuring his great detective, Sherlock Holmes.""*""Page 24 The Butterfly EffectThe Butterfly Effect is a tenet of chaos theory, the origins of which began in the late nineteenth century. The example of the ripple effect caused by butterfly's wings is said to have first been used by the science fiction writer Ray Bradbury who wrote about it in his short story A Sound of Thunder in 1952, but the term ""butterfly effect"" was coined in the 1960's by meteorologist Edward Lorenz.""I have never been able to come up with a reply to the question asked of book lovers, ""Which author would you most like to meet, and why?"".Yana Toboso would now be my immediate answer. Her closing comments greatly touched my heart, and convey her love and respect for her characters, drawing and writing:""Author's Note""""My drawing is nowhere near my ideal devil of a butler. I want to make him a much cooler and nobler handsome non-human! I've been drawing Sebas by trial and error this whole time, but even after ten volumes, my drawing is far from my ideal, and I can't stop my journey to the ideal Sebas in my head.""""I'd like to reach sanctuary already and settle down. But this journey will never end. That's how I feel. And so here's Volume 11, off to a new journey.""Second Read: 10/1/15: Library requires checkout of 10 volume set, so re-read in prep for new to me vol. 18-20",1 like,N/A
11973550,Black Butler XI,MissAnnThrope,561,5,4,"January 18, 2013","18 January 2013Black Butler, Vol. 11 concludes the dinner murder mystery plot with Sebastian's amusing retelling of events to our clever friend, Arthur. YES! You read that right. Our favorite butler is alive and well. He is the namesake of the series after all.Poor Arthur! I wonder why Sebastian revealed his true identity to him. Perhaps he did it to make him the exceptional, imaginative writer that he has become? One can only guess.This volume was so amusing! There were so many moments that made me laugh out loud. I love the quick humor thrown in between the bloody details of murder. This is one smart manga series. It blends wit, humor, and mystery perfectly.Although the true identities of the murderers were a bit predictable, I still very much enjoyed the hoops Sebastian had to jump through to pull off the farce. Again, his love of cats kills me every single time!I love how he screeches to a halt for his lady love! Sebastian really had me in stitches with his snarky comments:""I am drenched in tears and nasal secretions.""Ahahahahahaha!One of my other favorite moments in the story was of Soma and Agni hand-delivering Ciel's attempted murderer straight to his doorstep. I love those two! I found it interesting how Ciel handled Snake. Considering he didn't hesitate burning the missing children, I'm confounded why he took Snake on. However, Ciel is quite the complex character and will probably make good use of Snake's abilities.There really are so many reasons I adore this manga. I love how Yana Toboso integrates history and literature into the stories. With her tribute to Sherlock and references to one of the best vampire stories, Carmilla, I'm becoming smitten with her work. I also love that food has a frequent role in the volumes as well. Plus, her artistry is beautiful. Now that I'm all caught up with the series, I don't know how I'll cope with waiting for the next one to be released. It's been so much fun!The cliffhanger ending has me so curious! Vampire? Zombie? I can't wait to find out. Also, I'm looking forward to seeing more of the handsome, suave, lawn-mower wielding shinigami!",1 like,N/A
