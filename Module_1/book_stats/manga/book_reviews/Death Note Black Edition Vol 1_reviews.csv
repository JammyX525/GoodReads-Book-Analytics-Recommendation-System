6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,chloe,238,27800,4,"October 12, 2018","4.5 stars!cw: violence, murder, suicideOmg this was INCREDIBLE! This got me out of my reading slump because it was so interesting, complex, fast-paced and action packed. It's super dark, twisted and thought-provoking and I loved it. I did have a few problems with it which is why I am rating it 4.5 instead of 5 (e.g. some lines containing misogyny).I am SO excited to continue on with the series ahhh!!! ",96,4

6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Katie Colson,603,5199,3,"September 11, 2022","Review/Vlog: https://youtu.be/5CKFt2EcLAULet's talk about the elephant in the room - misogyny.This man, Tsugumi Ohba, is really out here writing about a brilliant female FBI agent who gets engaged and is told by her fiancee that she can't work anymore and that when she has a bunch of babies she'll be too busy to think about her passion for her career. Liiiiiiiike, excuse me, what? And how every man is a genius but the women are seen as secondary and inconsequential. They aren't even deemed worthy of being a threat of any caliber.BUTBUTBUTI really enjoyed everything besides that.Light and L are literally geniuses and the twisted web they weave with each other is second only to Sherlock and Moriarty.I love Ryuk. He is this death god who has all the power and all the answers and literally refuses to divulge any information or help in anyway. He's there for every scene but does absolutely nothing. Just being a sassy side character and I love him to be honest.",56,N/A
6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Lucy,411,594,4,"December 21, 2019","4****A great, smart, and twisty graphic novel! Light Yagami is the top student with great ambition- and he is bored out of his mind. His monotonous life changes when he finds the Death note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami- a death God. Any human who touches the death note is able to the death god who owns it. Light is able to see a death god named Ryuk. The death note enables the death of the human whose name is written in the book. As Light discovers it’s power, he vows to rid the world of evil and become worshipped like a God. When people start to die, Light finds an enemy in a secretive investigator only known as L. This book allows the reader to see the power hunger, intelligence, and competition between the two men. We are witness to Light’s moral decline as he plans to win the game between him and L.",36,13
6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Amelia,172,49,5,"October 13, 2020",Wow!!!This is the first time I have given reading manga a go. I loved the anime series of Death Note so I thought this would be a good place to start.I enjoyed this so much. I was interested throughout the whole book and was left with this sad feeling because I don't have the rest of the volumes. I am honestly going to have to go and buy them now. Highly recommend! And they are quick to read.,28,N/A

6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Sara (sarawithoutanH),439,2869,3,"July 11, 2016","3.5/5I read the first two volumes of Death Note in one sitting and I really enjoyed the cat and mouse dynamic between Light and L. Ryuk was by far my favorite character - I loved his snide commentary. I kind of wish the art had been in color, although I know that's not common in manga. I also realized that I don't enjoy manga as much as I did when I was younger. I found myself sometimes ignoring the pictures and just reading the text. Maybe I'm just too used to reading regular books, haha. Overall, this was a good time and I'm glad I read it. ",24,N/A

  ""The human whose name is written in this note shall die.""
I couldn't put Death Note down once I started it; I had to continue flipping the pages until it ended. I love the main character Light Yagami; he's a mix between Hermione, Lord Voldemort, the Joker and Batman, as weird as that all sounds. He's very clever and intelligent, however he does very morally-questionable things.Good and bad are not as simply divided as black and white; there are grey areas too. And Light is a perfect example of that. The premise of Death Note was very promising and it was executed extremely well! In the beginning there is a bit of an information dump because the principles and the power of the Death Note need to be explained. However, after the basics were revealed, the pace quickly picked up and the manga became addictive!
  ""I'm creating a criminal-free utopia... over which I plan to reign like a god for long time.""
Light wants to use the Death Note to make the world a better place. In the beginning his intentions are good, but at a certain moment he becomes a bit power-hungry. The power to kill people, by simply writing their name down in the Death Note with their face in his mind, makes him arrogant. He can deliver punishments to those who are ""bad"" and reward those who are ""good"" by not killing them. The whole abstract idea of good vs bad and right vs wrong is challenged. As a reader it made me consider my own values and what I would have done if I was Light. It also made me think about the value of life and whether any human beings as individuals have the right to kill another human being. Even if the ones being killed are the ""bad guys"" is that enough of a justification to become a ""bad guy"" by killing them? Death Note gave me a lot of food for thought. It has a lot more depth than I thought it would have on first sight. I definitely recommend it! The artwork is beautiful, and the story is magnificent!When I was reading Death Note I thought of what Gandalf said in The Fellowship of the Ring. It seems very fitting.
  ""Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. For even the very wise cannot see all ends.""
Whilst reading Death Note my mind also wandered to this beautiful poem by r.m. drake:
  love what loves youbut never hate whathates you, for hateis the burden toexhaust the starsin you.r.m. drake

6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Lauren,801,931,5,"August 29, 2017","Oooooooh, this was good. And I mean REALLY good! Death Note follows Light Yagami who is a straight A student who finds the Death Note (a notebook accidentally dropped by Ryuk - a Shinigami death god) outside of his school. From there, he discovers what exactly the Death Note is capable of, and, what he himself is capable of (trust me, the power most definitely goes to his head!)In the beginning, I can kind of understand his motive behind what he does (trying to rid the world of evil) however, on knowing that there are FBI agents and the Japanese Task Force out to catch ""Kira"" (the name given to Light by the media), he then starts bumping them off too (people who are innocent and only doing their job!!) Death Note is incredibly creepy but you quickly get sucked into Light's mindset which compels you to continue reading. The other main character in this book is ""L"" who has made it his sole mission to foil ""Kira"" and stop his killing spree. It's a fantastic race against time with two very smart individuals going head to head with each other. And yes, I know it's heavily male-dominated but the story is just too darn good and this is why it deserves a solid 5 stars!!!! Two words to describe this book - addictive and compelling! ",18,4
6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Martha,82,37,4,"January 10, 2019","4.5 stars!I love this manga series so much! I love the characters (although I never know who to actually support) so so much, and the story line is so interesting and unique.I cannot wait to continue with the series!",13,6
6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Trista Tabaldo,138,17,4,"December 12, 2022","I actually read the entire series, but I don’t like cluttering my lists. This series was really addictive and I completely understand why it’s held in such high regard. Light Yagami is such a great example of a deeply flawed character with just enough redeeming qualities that you’re still sort of rooting for him even though he’s awful. L was my favorite. The middle was kind of dodgy at times, but I found this series to be quite fun regardless. I also think it had a pretty satisfactory ending considering.",12,N/A
6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Regina,110,35,5,"November 4, 2017","(So I'm leaving my pre-review, because my reaction was way too funny to be erased) NO. IT CANT END THERE.QUICKLY WHERE THE FUCK CAN I FIND THE NEXT VOLUMES IN ENGLISH HERE IN FREAKING MEXICO.FUCK. BOOK DEPOSITORY. I NEED BOOK DEPOSITORY RIGHT NOW.Rtc because I need to find the next volumes 🙃〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰〰So now that I've calmed down (part of that was because I might be able to get the next volumes in a week or so), I think I'll be able to write a decent (and by that I mean weird) review.This was the first manga I've read, I watch anime but I had never ever read manga. And let me tell you, IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT.I am absolutely in love with Death Note now.I must admit I am a sucker for morally grey characters and Light was simply perfection.Also I'm so intrigued to see what'll happen next (If you dare to spoil me I'LL MAKE SURE YOUR NAME APPEARS IN A DEATH NOTE).The tension was killing me, which is why I almost had a heart attack when I realized I didn't have the next manga.I am also very curious about L and everything about his backstory (you know, the one he doesn't even have. Yet.) And I really want to know if they'll actually catch Light aka Kira. Is it bad that I'm actually rooting for him? 😂😂😂But the plot wasn't the thing I loved the most. No, that definitely was Ryuk. ❤️I don't even know why I love Ryuk so much, Light and Ryuk's interactions made me laugh like a crazy lady. And I simply loved that Ryuk was that one bitch that's just there for the drama. I loved the fact he was amused by everyone's stupidity.And he fucking wanted to play Mario golf. And he loves apples. If that's not cute I don't know what cute is.Oh, and also, I hope one day my eyeliner is as fierce as Ryuk's. That's all I have to say, now I'll go and wait for the week to pass so I can get the next volume.THE HYPE FOR THIS THING IS REAL.",12,N/A
6345999,Death Note Black Edition Vol 1,Lamar,161,84,5,"May 8, 2015","My brother practically forced me into reading Death Note. You see, I'm not a big manga person, but I like comics so hey why not? He bought the book and made a deal with me: if you don't like it, I have nothing against you. But if you do like it, then you have to give me the money I spent on that book. that's how sure he was because let me tell my brother is a financially conservative guy.Only a few chapters in, and I give him his money back.Death Note is officially my first manga read; a format I approached initially with a great deal of trepidation, based mostly on false assumptions of the content of manga. Even though the story did a lot of 'telling' rather than 'showing' it was good, you can't deny it worked for the storyline. The characters were very interesting and vibrant, I liked how I couldn't quite decide who's the bad guy over there, I rooted for both the protagonist and the antagonist. (Side note: L's face creeped the shit outta me, man. I don't know if you guys know ""The Grudge"" the movie, remember? no? but good God L looks exactly like you know the boy whose father had killed him and the cat? that creepy women's son, RIGHT? Oh that movie used to give me a good deal of nightmares back in the day)A few points taken because the plot in the last chapter was unfeasible. I mean yeah you can tell somebody went through your stuff, but how did you know there were cameras and bugs?! that's impossible.",11,1 comment
