7921923,Black Butler VII,Miss Ryoko,"2,591",120,4,"January 3, 2015","I know I say it in every review for a Black Butler volume, but it can't be helped... DAMN Sebastian is a sexy bitch! XD!!! I seriously almost passed out during this part:
  
OH. MY. GOD. So hot!But seriously ( XD ) this was an exciting volume and the end was AMAZING!!! I was like *GAAAAAAAASP* and now I'm dying to know what's going to happen. The only problem is that I'm getting these from the library so I have to 1) wait for the volume to come out and then 2) wait in the wait line at the library to get the book, so I never remember what happened in the last volume. So I'm going to have buy them and read them all together once they're all out.Anyway, fantastic work Toboso-san! Great volume!!",17,15
7921923,Black Butler VII,Noran Miss Pumkin,463,94,5,"November 8, 2011","The depth of story develop just gets better with each volume of this series. the detailed drawing is still there as well. We discover the evil behind the circus, and also finally start to get some history on Ceil and the Phamtomhive family. It is a dark and intriguing family tree alright! We also get to see Ceil as a small child, with two eyes, and meet his father. How they died though, the whole family?!?!? The Butler does some dark things, very dark oh my-that is why this is for adults I feel. I did gasp at some of the story line, horrified that Ceil just watched children die in front of him--the Queen's mission was for him the save them. This series is now truly starting to show it's dark, horror side. Very dark indeed-one I an eager to continue-I guess in 2012-since the next volume is not even available for pre-order yet. ",6,N/A

7921923,Black Butler VII,Alexxy,375,60,3,"November 17, 2018","The circus is seriously one of my favorite things in this manga. Toboso's drawings are so detailed and beautiful, I just love everything about this volume. Plus, we finally got to see a deeper glimpse into Ciel's past.Chapter by Chapter thoughts following:Chapter 28 â†’ â™  Haha, so Freckles is a girl? I didn't remember this bit either.â™  I kind of feel bad for Freckles. She feels like a simple and innocent person, I don't want Ciel using her or whatever.â™  Another piece I did not remember! So, Ciel has asthma, huh?â™  ""Some, Sebastian."" And the devil appears out of nowhere. Cool and creepy.â™  Argh, I want to punch that fucking reaper in the face and scream at him that wherever Sebastian goes, it's none of his damn business!â™  Oooooh, since Sebastian's always with Ciel, I was starting to forget that he's a man with urges. (lol)Chapter 29 â†’ â™£ My my, so Sebastian got his gloves 'dirty'? (hahaha)â™£ They get what they want and they bolt. But Ciel, what about Freckles?â™£ Ciel's still sick and Agni manages to convince Sebastian that his master's well-being is more important than his orders. (lol)â™£ And everything's finally in motion. The circus is on the move to get... Ciel?â™£ So, 'suit's' name is William?Chapter 30 â†’ â™  I believe I remember who the creepy bandaged dude is.â™  Although Joker had not done anything to gain my interest and trust, I feel sorry for him. To be honest, since I know exactly what's going to happen, I feel sorry for everyone.â™  Ahh, Prince Soma, you are kind, but I think Ciel's past the point of fawning over.â™  So, there are telephones but no lamps? What? And trains, too? I have no idea about the technology of this manga.Chapter 31 â†’ â™£ Jesus, this Baron Kelvin guy is completely crazy.â™£ The pain Joker is feeling doing the performance, the way he clenches his teeth, those poor children.â™£ Ooooh, can it be that Sebastian based the look he has on Ciel's father?â™£ We're going to finally find out about Ciel's past.Chapter 32 â†’ â™  ""Special People"", huh? I guess I kind of know the feeling. Do you ever see an equip you can never join, but you oh-so-desperately want to?â™  Let's see: The undertaker + Vincent + Mr. Tanaka + Uncle Klaus (??). I don't think we're supposed to know everyone in this picture, but what the hell is Undertaker doing there?â™  Soooo, Baron Kelvin has been kidnapping kids and stuff, so that Ciel would ill him?

7921923,Black Butler VII,K.,932,70,4,"June 16, 2017","And here we see the core of Ciel's belief about humanity, the thing that allows him to be a dang good Problem Solver at such a young age. He shares this philosophy with other notable fictional detectives Sherlock Holmes and Dr. House (who is certainly more vehement about it). Ciel, due to his past experiences, tends to lean towards the cynical House side rather than the more clinical Holmes. He never takes someone at face value.Still, it hasn't irreparably harmed him. Yet.[context: through a loophole in orders, Sebastian ""accidentally"" placed Ciel in danger from venemous snakes]I find it interesting that Sebastian chose to elaborate on what he did, creating a game between himself and his Master. Ciel is historically interested in games of all types, even more prideful and competitive than the average preteen boy. I think I was on the right path earlier, with the misery fondue. A challenged soul tastes better.Our intrepid duo eventually comes across the horrorshow that is Father and his ~dream~, where we are treated to the idea that Jack the Ripper was actually quite mundane in the way he murdered people by comparison. This all culminates into a clusterfuck of nightmare proportions for Ciel as we wade our way into his Level 4 Tragic Backstory.Also, a glimpse at the #1 Hottest Manga Dad which makes the angst approximately one thousand times worse because we know he dead and shy baby Ciel is gone forever.Oh, Vincent.

It kind of counts).",3,N/A

7921923,Black Butler VII,Lanie,"1,055",70,5,"June 13, 2017","Holy fucking shit. That was some dark stuff right there. It's so deliciously evil! >:D seriously, not for kids. It's dark and creepy and frankly disturbing. (Also has a sex scene. Nothing to graphic, but damn is Sebastian sexy!) You thought madam red was fucked up!? Try this guy! Those deaths... That's the stuff of nightmares, people. & the ending? Perfection! The first couple volumes or so, I was on the fence a bit about the phantomhive servants. I couldn't decide wether or not I like them. But that ending certainly got my attention and made them much more interesting.Omg. That last pic of Finny? That was creepy as fuck. What a fucking perfect cliffhanger! XD Volume 7 is wonderful. Along with its continuation of the circus story arc it also starts giving us a tiny bit of information on the phantomhive family, like Ciel's father. (Anyone else think he looked a lot like Sebastian?) Sebastian gets a bit of a lesson in being a better butler & there are some adorable scenes with Prince Soma. Fucking love that little guy! XD! The story lines get better and darker with every volume & Ciel & Sebastian are definitely some of my favorite manga characters. What with Ciel being my dear messed up little anti hero, & Sebastian being so creepy & sexy & polite all at once. :) the art work is gorgeously detailed with great facial expressions & character designs.Recommended for old teens. 16+ due to sexual content (including some HEAVILY implied child sexual abuse) & graphic violence. This is not for the faint of heart, but a definite must have for any manga lovers who enjoy a darker more fantastical read.",2,N/A
7921923,Black Butler VII,Hope,543,11,2,"November 11, 2011","This volume didn't really do anything for me. The circus is confusing - the characters all look alike and it is hard to tell what is going on with them. Baron Kelvin is bizarre and also confusing - WTF is going on with him? He is so in love with the Phantomhives that he gets tons of surgeries to make himself prettier to them? He is trying to recreate some event in Ciel's history, but what exactly isn't clear - maybe the ceremony where he meets Sebastian? Anyway, this one is just a bit too weird to be interesting.",2,1 comment
7921923,Black Butler VII,TheBookishHobbit,307,3,5,"October 10, 2021"," Things are beginning to heat up in this arc! Barron Kalvin is truly a creep and he does get what he deserves. I've always questioned what exactly did he do to the children? Was it a lobotomy considering the holes in their skulls? Technically, they are still alive but they are pretty much vegetative so I always believed this sicko preformed lobotomies and made them slaves, as well as some other things I can't mention here. Oh well, another great installment for this series! ",2,N/A
7921923,Black Butler VII,Madhumita,214,5,5,"January 17, 2022","Really interesting volume. We see a more manipulative side of Sebastian and more insight into Cielâ€™s background. Honestly what happened to him was so horrible, I can understand why heâ€™s such a brat all the time. Baron Kelvin is so messed up too. Definitely the darkest volume so far.",2,N/A
