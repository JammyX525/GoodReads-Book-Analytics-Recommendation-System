287380,Kare Kano His and Her Circumstances Vol 1,Kate,986,72,3,"February 24, 2012","Kare Kano is one of those series that I keep seeing mentioned in manga circles, but one I never could get into myself. I reminded myself that I felt that way about Ouran once upon a time, so it was time to give Kare Kano one more chance.The verdict: I gradually warmed up to the story. The basic premise - two high school students whose persona of perfection is a charade doesn't resonate with me. I actually found the two main characters unlikeable for 2/3 of the series. It's the side characters that I grew to love, and I became much more interested in their stories than that of Yukino or Arima. Thankfully, Masami Tsuda found her feet with those two on the final arc of the series, which was quite compelling and enjoyable.Kare Kano is a 21 volume series, sadly out of print (thank you, library, for providing me with the chance to read this series!). Slightly recommended. I'm sure at the time (mid-90's) of its publishing, Kare Kano was ground-breaking in some ways (hence it still being spoken of today), but not nearly as much as Kodocha.",9,2

I know it'll get tough later, and everything is not all sweet and sunshine, but for now, the story is still amusing and entertaining.",4,N/A

287380,Kare Kano His and Her Circumstances Vol 1,thebloggerandthegeek,486,15,5,"March 25, 2016","I watched the anime years ago and I read the whole manga set when I was a freshman in high school. My friend use to bring them to school and during Science class we used to read them ♥My love for Kare Kano hasn't change. For me the story it's very sweet and funny. There are some ridiculous parts where I just roll my eyes (because come on, who cares how she behaves at home, we are all different at home, at work or school, but then again this is a different culture).I love Yukino, she's funny, arrogant, self-absorbent but truly she's sweet and caring. I love her character, she's so out of this world, sometimes dumb, other times just plain funny. And Arima, my goodness, such a sweet and handsome character. His past is very sad thought and I love how in the future we get to experience a bit more about them. The art, just so perfect! I like how they keep the funny factor and yet the way they draw the moments were it's deep and romantic so beautiful, I swear I can see the invisible air playing with Yukino's hair when Arima looks at her. I'm so happy I bought the volumes, this brings me back to high school life and friendships♥",2,N/A
287380,Kare Kano His and Her Circumstances Vol 1,Joseph Young,805,7,3,"September 22, 2011","It is not as good as the anime, which is my favourite of all time. If I had read the manga first, I might be more lenient and find it amazing. However, this manga just leaves me craving all the detail of the anime, which was much better developed. There is one additional story at the end, (not in the anime) that was somewhat interesting, although the protagonist's self loathing makes me dislike her somewhat. ",2,2

287380,Kare Kano His and Her Circumstances Vol 1,StrawberryShojo,265,20,4,"May 20, 2021","Kare Kano is a gut-wrenching and wild ride. If you have only seen the anime, then you are missing a lot of the meat of this story. Kare Kano follows the story of Yukino who strives to be an image of perfection. She’s beautiful, is at the top of her class, and seems naturally good at everything she tries. However, this perfection is a complete facade. Yukino’s home life reveals her to be a messy, rude, narcissist, who is obsessed with being the best. Yukino’s obsessive pursuits seem to be fueled by the praise and admiration she receives from those around her, it becomes clear that she has a crippling fear of failure. Meanwhile, her class rival, Soichiro aims for perfection for entirely different reasons. Soichiro’s perfect life aims to conceal his dark past as he tries to make up for the abuse and trauma he faced as a child. He clearly has an overwhelming fear of loss and rejection.Throughout the story, these two characters’ lives intertwine as they learn one another’s secrets and help one another work through their problems. Each of them grows as individuals separate from one another, but they also grow as friends and eventually a couple. If you have watched the anime, then your perception of this story is probably that it is a romantic comedy. While you are not necessarily wrong, this manga reaches levels of depth and darkness that the anime definitely does not prepare you for. This story tackles topics like self-harm, suicide, domestic abuse, sexual assault, and unwanted pregnancy, and a whole slew of mental health-related issues. While the manga covers much of these topics with noticeable care and sensitivity, I will say that given that the manga ran from the mid-’90s to the early ’00s, its understanding of some of these issues can feel quite dated at times. There are elements to this story that I think are actively harmful. Specifically, the great length’s to which Yukino attempts to heal Soichiro’s dark past. This establishes a narrative in which a woman’s strength is defined by her ability to stand by her man no matter what. Unfortunately, that kind of storytelling has real-world consequences no matter how realistic the depiction is in this case. While it is not at the forefront of the story-telling, this manga also perpetuates the idea that girls should pursue older men; that they have more to offer and are simply more suitable partners than more age-appropriate options. This is a sentiment that I absolutely do not agree with, and I believe it to be a harmful trope. That being said, while this story is quite dark at times it has an undeniable honesty and relevancy to the narrative. In many ways, it feels realistic, even if it is uncomfortable, which is probably why so many manga readers still flock to this series years after its publication. If you liked Fruits Basket or Mars, then I think you would enjoy Kare Kano. I think Fruits Basket does a better job unpacking different kinds of trauma, especially in regards to toxic masculinity. However, for better or worse, Kare Kano never relies on metaphor or fantasy to soften the blow of hard-hitting topics and in that way feels all too real in its delivery.",1 like,N/A

287380,Kare Kano His and Her Circumstances Vol 1,Declan Waters,522,3,3,"August 18, 2017","I first read the first few books of this series at University, and prior to a clearout felt a final re-read (and new read of the later books) was in order.Miyazawa & Arima are the top two students in their school, being able to juggle anything they need to do - school council, homework, academic studies, sport - but Miyazawa is jealous of Arima's success. When she beats him in the school rankings though they soon find that they are both human and have more in common than they thought.This is a nice simple Romantic Comedy, and not something I would normally read in 'western' literature, but reading manga allows me to change my normal genre and this is no exception. Nice fun collection starting off the story.",1 like,N/A
287380,Kare Kano His and Her Circumstances Vol 1,Dani ❤️ Perspective of a Writer,"1,512",5,5,"May 25, 2015",I really enjoyed seeing this girl come out of her shell! I wish it were that easy to flip a switch and be yourself in from of people - its more a compulsion that people understand. While only 3 chapters I like the turn of events that developed this secret between the characters.I identified with how Yokino wanted to be all put together in from of her classmates and all laid back at home with her sisters. I also understood how Soichiro felt he had to be perfect to show his uncle and aunt whom took on the role of parents for him that he won't betray them like his real parents did.BOTTOM LINE: Intrigued by this couple.,1 like,N/A

The anime was also really good (and the unique director there helped), but here the story progresses at a nicer pace, and all the loose ends get tied at the end.The characters are somewhat over-the-top, but not by much.",1 like,4
