13094398,Black Butler XII,Ria,643,89,2,"April 11, 2021","What the fuck was this volume? I'm pissed off. So pissed off at this volume. Why? Because of Elizabeth. She's the most fucking irritating character ever. First she intentionally follows Ciel into a dangerous situation, then refuses to go to safety because in doing so she won't look CUTE anymore and lastly she almost DIED because SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DEFEND HERSELF because she wanted to look cute and innocent to Ciel. Why the fuck would you want to die looking cute instead of choosing to live? Are you kidding me? The situation was that Lizzy had to crawl through a air duct to escape from FLESH EATING ZOMBIES but when Ciel tells Lizzy she has to take off her skirts to fit inside what does she say? ""NO. I DON'T WANT TO. I WANT TO LOOK CUTE FOR CIEL UNTIL THE END."" At this point I was so annoyed at her actions. I never liked Lizzy, she was annoying and is such a brat. I don't even know why Ciel or her parents don't discipline her ==""I just can't. The stupidity is too high. She's too dependant on Ciel for happiness. Like she needs his approval or acceptance. She treats him badly and disregards HIS feelings. Like what, he won't wear clothes she picked out so she gets all upset and cries and destroy the things that she didn't buy. Goddddjjdjdjs I can't take her bratty behavior anymore, if she doesn't move away or die in this manga I'm going to lose my mind.",8,2

And I love how the characters are growing. I mean, look at Snake. Look at ELIZABETH.Plus, I was so surprised by all the gore and horrible stuff happening in here. I mean, Black Butler has never been shy of blood and murder, but this volume was pure gore. And I loved it!",7,N/A
13094398,Black Butler XII,MissAnnThrope,561,5,4,"March 19, 2013","18 March 2013Black Butler, Vol. 12 is creeptastic! This action-packed volume is what would happen if the The Walking Dead invaded the Titanic. The story picks up immediately where the last volume left off and we discover the abomination lurking below deck.Flesh-eating corpses!!Thankfully, Yana Toboso, is brilliant at balancing the grotesque with the hilarious with just the perfect amount of eye candy thrown in to keep a girl happy. Sebastian is all kinds of awesome as he takes down the hordes of flesh-eaters. Not only do we have the pleasure of seeing Sebastian demolishing corpses, but we also get the added bonus of not one, but two, shinigami entering the fray. Grelle Sutcliff and Ronald Knox à la Titanic. Hilarious!To keep things from getting too macabre - silly Phoenix salutations.Eye candy. Dripping wet Sebastian. Mmm....Well, I'll be damned. The ending totally threw me for a loop. So unexpected. I have to say, even though I've never been a fan of Elizabeth, I felt pleasantly surprised and couldn't help cheering her on.Go on with yo badass self, Lizzie!As always, the art is exceptional. Leave it to Yana Toboso to draw beautifully gothic zombies. I think it's a feat only she could accomplish.I love when this series takes a darker turn, especially because Sebastian usually needs to unleash his ninja skills on the baddies. The surprising ending has me really curious to find out what happens next. Can't wait for the next volume!",3,N/A

13094398,Black Butler XII,Tamara,360,3,5,"October 5, 2015","Possibly one of the best volumes in the series. This one had everything! Action, horror, nail biting suspense, emotional impact, humour, and last but not least, a huge unexpected twist that even I didn't see coming. My heart leapt with joy in the exact same moment my jaw dropped.Nice to see the reapers back in action, always a good time when one of them (or two!) show up. It's impossible not to enjoy their blasé attitude surrounding death. Ronald Knox's carefree tone to the book adds something interesting to the mix as well. Would love to see more of him in the future. I also really enjoy the little bits with Snake, who I feel is a lovely little addition to Ciel's odd (and oddly charming) cast of servants. I think there is a fair amount of potential for his character to develop.The take on the 'Titanic' is rather amusing, and was one I expected to see. I love how the series picks up bits and pieces of history and incorporates their 'truths' into the fictional world of Black Butler.The art work, as usual, is gorgeous as always, albeit a bit more macabre than previous volumes considering this one has a lot of the 'living' dead roaming around and eating people.All in all, this volume has set the pace and the bar for future volumes in the series. I look forward to the next addition!",2,N/A

But I can't quit you because I want my burning question answered: WILL THERE EVER BE A PLOT? So continuing you I will do... though you've been the bookish equivalent of a sleeping pill for a while now.",2,N/A

I did not expect something like this to happen in the late 19th century. Wow. And Elizabeth is just full of surprises it seems.,2,N/A

13094398,Black Butler XII,Leigh Louise,87,1 follower,5,"August 23, 2017","Another awesome read! Really can see the eliments of the story being transferred to the movie from the manga. The creators stuck pretty close to the storyline, with the only differences being perhaps character design and dialogue. But, other than that, the movie and the manga are very similar.I love how the author bought eliments of the titanic into this lol. And Grell, where would the storyline be without him haha. It's awesome that Lizzy got a better feature, and this storyline allowed her to show her true colours. This book features only part of the movies plot from the time the zombies came to life in the secret Phoenix meeting to the time that Lizzy showcased her true colours. So the movie is centred around several volumes overall.Looking forward to reading the next instalment.",1 like,N/A

Along with complications from the arrival of grim reapers who are intent of taking advantage of the situation, our Black Butler is having a hard time keeping his charge safe. Good thing he has back up ..... in the form of ..............the Earl's betrothed? Oooooooo! This is a good issue!",1 like,N/A
13094398,Black Butler XII,TheBookishHobbit,307,3,5,"October 20, 2021"," Ahh the continuation of the Book of Atlantic arc! Things are getting weird in this Titanic x Zombie arc, but in a fun way. I remember when I read Elizabeth's big ""reveal"" at the end of the volume I was shocked just as all of you were. I was stunned she could actually fight given how I was often annoyed by her. Still am annoyed with her sometimes, but it is nice to know she could hold her own in an actual fight. Very interesting volume! ",1 like,N/A
