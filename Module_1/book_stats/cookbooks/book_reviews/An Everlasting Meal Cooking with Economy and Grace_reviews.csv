11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Chris,306,8,2,"March 4, 2012","Adler's chapter titles (which are lovely) acknowledge her debt to MFK Fisher, and Fisher's style is clearly what Adler is shooting for. Unfortunately, she lacks Fisher's genius of finding the unexpectedly perfect word, and too often she misses and lands on twee, pretentious or just meaningless. There's nothing particularly solemn about cauliflower stalks; capers do not taste anything like pebbles; and I have never been bewildered by a breakfast of cold pasta, no matter how delicious.I'm being unfair to the book, because there's a lot of good stuff in here - I have a new resolve to find things to do with my scraps and leftovers, and her method of pitting olives is worth the price of admission by itself. (Put them on a board and squish down with the bottom of a mug or jar or something, then wiggle it around a bit. Pick out the loosened stones and you're done. BRILLIANCE.) There's a valuable cooking philosophy in here screaming to be let out. A more transparent style would have given it a chance to shine.",53,8
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Kelly Bragg,158,1 follower,5,"September 2, 2020","READ.THIS.BOOK. When I began reading An Everlasting Meal, I was struck by how beautifully Tamar Adler described food she cooks - not just the usual how does it smell, how does it taste - but with glowing descriptions of the texture, feel, and appearance. When she describes a meal, you are right there with her! It wasn't far into the book that I decided that I simply MUST have a copy to call my very own. Not long after that, I realized that one of the reasons I loved this book so much is that it reminds me of my grandmother. Tamar cooks with the grace & love that my grandmother did, and that she passed along to me. Tamar's description/explanation of cooking is how I cook most of the time, so no wonder I loved this book! It reminds me of all the things I love about ""playing"" in the kitchen, and why I should spend even more time there.",15,2
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Sharon,338,490,4,"July 7, 2015","In an age when every recipe seems to come with a list of ingredients as long as my arm, Tamar Adler's approach to food is disarmingly simple, refreshingly intuitive, and utterly sensible. I found her suggestions for what to do with the odds and ends of dishes particularly helpful. (I'll never stare at a giant bunch of parsley or a rind of Parmesan with bewilderment again!) The night I finished the book, I found myself confronted with rather bare cupboards and, armed with Adler's injunctions and encouragement, managed to whip up a delicious soup of old potatoes, wilted green onions, and bacon bits that quite literally may have changed my entire outlook on cooking. Beginner chefs may balk at not having step by step instructions or exact measurements (Adler tends to suggest rather than dictate, and it can be dizzying at times to attempt to follow all of the uses she finds for one ingredient) but for anyone comfortable at a stove, Adler's book will feel like learning long-lost tricks in grandmother's kitchen. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to cook with a little more economy or a little more grace.",14,N/A
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Esther Espeland,255,17,5,"December 4, 2020","This is one of the best books about food I have ever read! Freaking loved it. A beautiful book of essays peppered with recipes and guidance. Her approach to food is pleasure-centered with equal weight to simplicity, practicality, and economical thriftiness which checks all my boxes! I immediately started using her recipes and dreaming about cooking with turnips. She shares her reverence for ingredients and uses every part of the animal or vegetable. She’s anti diet, anti capitalist, and anti-classist and writes beautifully. One of my favorite quotes: “And always a few bunches of dark, leafy greens. This will seem very pious. Once greens are cooked as they should be, though: hot and lustily, with garlic, in a good amount of olive oil, they lose their sense of moral urgency and become one of the most likable ingredients in your kitchen.”I really feel that this book will shape my cooking ethos for years to come!",13,1 comment
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Kate,649,96,5,"August 3, 2012","If I could go back in time for just a couple of days, one of the things I'd like to do is sit down with my grandmothers and let them teach me all of those little secrets they knew about getting a meal to turn out just right. Born in the 1880's, both grandmother's knew how to cook before there were such things as degrees on oven dials. They used real ingredients, very few came from a box. What I remember of them cooking from when I was a little girl, their hands moved instinctively. Just a taste would tell them what was missing--what belonged in the pot, and what to keep out. If I could go back in time for just a couple of days, I'd spend a part of those two days in their kitchens--breathing in the aromas of hot fresh donuts, or roast beef. Tamar Adler's book is the closest I will ever come to breathing in those aromas. Reading her book is like sitting down with your grandmother as she explains to you exactly what she's doing and why. Tamar knows those little secrets, and in beautiful prose, she passes them along to you. It takes a masterful writer to make a pot of boiled water into a cauldron of curiosities and wonders, but Tamar can do it. I loved this book. I adored this book. I highly recommend this book. If it doesn't have you dashing into your kitchen, digging through your pantry for those just-right ingredients, nothing will.",11,N/A
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Janet,85,15,4,"February 8, 2015","I heartily recommend this book to anybody who used to love to prepare good and sustaining meals but who's lost inspiration in the wake of so many cooking shows, food blogs and Pinterest. When I was growing up, my mom cooked every meal, every day, for years. While it was drudgery to her, the meals never reflected that. She grew up knowing true hunger and learned how to prepare food with economy, but not with parsimony. She used quality ingredients, fresh and in season, always prepared correctly -- and always with an eye to using the leftovers in the next meal. Until I was older, I never realized that was, in itself -- Art. She would probably think this book of essays a pure waste of time: elevating to prose what she used to do every day and celebrating what she gladly stopped doing when all of us began leaving home. Read it selectively and choose your essays based on the skills it imparts. Take some time to visit the author's blog and watch the videos if the essays begin to feel overwhelming. It's not a recipe book -- there are no photos of food. But you'll be encouraged to return to basics. ",8,1 comment
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Jimmy,511,687,2,"June 19, 2017","Tamar Adler's message and tone are somewhat at odds in this book. Her words are saying that cooking is for everyone and not just celebrity chefs and experts, that food does not have to be perfectly arranged on a plate, that it can be a messy daily thing full of mistakes and made on the spot with leftover ingredients that would have ended up in the trash anyway. I happen to hold all of these same beliefs, but her tone is contradicting her. Instead of opening us up to the possibilities of cooking, she tells us what we should do. That word ""should"" crops up everywhere. We should put our leftover bones into a pot and make stock. Which is fine for me, but I'm a believer (and I already do this, most days). If she is aiming to convert the noncook into a new lifestyle, she would do better to open up the possibilities using words that suggest and entice rather than prescribe.Sometimes she even comes across as snobby, which I'm sure is not her point. As when she says no egg that isn't coming straight from your own backyard chickens will do. I agree with her on moral principles--cruelty and factory farming practices necessarily impinges on our plate. But baby steps! That is an entirely different book than this one, and should be attempted once a daily practice has been established. Again: who is her intended audience here? Not to mention that it's also an extremely privileged stance; most of the people she's trying to reach will not be lucky enough to have their own chickens or have access to them (or afford them at a farmer's market).That said, this was a mildly successful book, in that it did teach me some things, while also boring me through some chapters of stuff I already know. The chapter on beans was especially eye-opening, as I do not cook beans nearly enough (usually I just reach for the canned ones at the last minute). And for that alone, as well as some useful tidbits here and there, this was worth reading.Adler's approach is to splice short recipes within long paragraphs of non-recipe prose (though there are recipes in those paragraphs too, just not in recipe form). Though it is definitely meant to be read from cover to cover and not as a reference book, it's a bit boring to read it like that at times, and her attempts at being poetic don't always work. Perhaps my opinion is tainted by the fact that I am already familiar with many of her strategies here (using leftovers, using all parts of the ingredient, etc.) Maybe for someone with less experience, this book would be useful. But then again, reading some of her recipes, I doubt a less experienced version of me would have found it very useful. Her prescriptions are very specific, and without going into the general principles behind why she is doing the things she is doing, a beginner would find it hard to generalize and find substitutions. Plus, she breezes past many of the most simple things that a beginner would need to execute these dishes. But then she has a chapter called How to Boil Water (tip: salt it, in most cases). So there's very advanced stuff here thrown in with very beginner stuff. I don't know who she's writing for.",7,2
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,ladydusk,416,165,4,"July 10, 2020","I enjoyed reading this. It's not an over the top superlative enjoyment nor a disdain at over-writing. It was a pleasant, empowering read. It helps to think of food a little differently, to think of the beauty and companionship of food, the simplicity of enjoying good food well cooked.The idea of an everlasting meal where one meal feeds into the next and that the next is a beautiful idea. Adler's presentation seems like it is perfect for a single person or couple, but for a family - we eat a head of cauliflower in a meal, and would gladly eat more - there are none left to jar lovingly and add to the fridge for later use. I really enjoyed most of the chapters as descriptive, not prescriptive. As one meal ending and holding hands with the next. Springboards. Some people don't like food that much to think about it so ... constantly, but I found the ideas inspiring. It is a book to cook in the spirit of, not the specifics. I don't really understand the constant ladling soup over bread ... I may try some of the things ... I should do the boiling water exercise at least. Maybe not in July/August.",7,N/A

11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,laura,156,129,5,"October 27, 2019","i read this book a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it-- it's a quick read!-- but didn't think much about it since. it's more of a practical how-to lifestyle book than a cookbook, per se, and the language can get pretty corny (""whilst"", ""of an evening"", stuff like that-- ""let's dial it back just like 15% huh,"" is what i thought a lot). but today as i was making broth in my kitchen for the next couple of weeks, i realized it was because of this book, and that the change it had brought about in my life, tho small in some ways, is probably one of the more significant forms of impact a book has ever had on me. i used to buy broth in bulk every month or so, and now, instead, i always make my own. i make it every other week or so, enough to last a week or two or three. and i do it without thinking about it much, and without spending anything on it (other than i now buy fancy bay leaves in bulk). i make it out of bits of things that i've saved over the week for that purpose-- also without thinking about it much. and, truly, i do it because (1) it makes everything i make taste so much better, (2) i enjoy it, and (3) because this lady explained to me in detailed, practical terms, what it looks like to be a person who regularly makes her own broth. for years now i've done it. ""with economy and grace"" might be overstating my achievement, but it's certainly been without much thought or effort. i'm transformed! so, tamar adler changed my life, i guess. thanks, TA! i'm really grateful. a five star goodreads review is the least i can do.",6,N/A
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Sarah,357,2,2,"March 27, 2012","I've heard a number of people saying they love this book and I see the appeal. But it wasn't for me. The writing was too precious and prescriptive for my taste and, having a lot of experience with using up every last bit of food by necessity, I didn't learn a lot from the content. (I also am wary of her advice. She made a number of claims that suggest that we have very different tastes- for example, that broccoli stems are delicious if you cook them long enough. Broccoli stems are in fact delicious if peeled, but she didn't mention that step.)I very much liked her idea of roasting vegetables in big batches for the week all at once and might give it a try. It's an especially great way to use up CSA shares effectively. ",6,N/A
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Nick Klagge,692,52,5,"July 7, 2012","As I'm writing this, I'm making something from this book, a recipe that Elise and I (affectionately) refer to as ""butt pesto."" (You'll have to ask me.)This is one of my favorite books about food I've ever read. It's patterned as a modern homage to MFK Fisher's book ""How to Cook a Wolf."" While I also enjoyed the MFKF book, TA's book has had much more of an actual impact on my life with food. What I think makes this book so special is that it is not about food in isolation (""here are a bunch of things that taste great!""), as most books about food tend to be. Rather, it provides a vision of the place of food and cooking in one's life. If you think about it, there are a lot of possible versions of this, more or less as many as there are people. TA's vision happens to be fairly aligned with the way I think food fits into mine and Elise's lives, but she articulates it in a way that is inspiring and thought-provoking. Her way of thinking of course owes a lot to MFKF, and is also pretty close in style to Robert Farrar Capon's ""ferial"" cooking from ""The Supper of the Lamb."" Basically, as the title suggests, this view centers around treating meals not as independent events, to be separately conceived and planned in advance, but as a sort of unbroken chain in which the leftovers or leavings of one meal provide substance and inspiration for another in the future. In practice it involves having lots of little glass jars in the fridge, which I enjoy a lot, containing basically anything you didn't use, down to the liquid from your can of chick peas. It's certainly a frugal method, and one that really encourages creative cooking. But more than these things, I love it because it establishes a sort of living rhythm to the food in one's life, in a way that reminds me of the following words from Nel Noddings' book ""Caring"" which have stuck with me for a long time:""The one-caring, then, is not bored with ordinary life. As the Christian-Catholic finds new truth and strength in repeated celebrations of the mass, so the one-caring finds new delight in breakfast, in welcoming home her wanderers, in feeding the cat who purrs against her ankle, in noticing the twilight. She does not ask, 'Is this all there is?,' but wishes in hearty affirmation that what-is might go on and on.""",4,1 comment
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Laurie,942,37,4,"May 15, 2012","This is not so much a cookbook as a book about cooking, a philosophy of cooking. Adler’s premise is that simple meals are better than production numbers; that great meals can be had from bits and bobs of old meals; that you should save every little vegetable scrap or peel. Her theories are sound; onion peels and broccoli stems make great stock and everything tastes better cooked in stock. Stale bread is good for any number of things, from croutons to thickening sauce. But while the word ‘economy’ is in the title, the author uses it to mean ‘not wasting things’, rather than ‘eating cheaply’. She recommends vast amounts of butter and olive oil; organic, free range chickens; fancy olives and prosciutto, and buying a responsibly raised cow – going in with a group to do this, of course, not taking the whole beast home yourself- but still expensive when you consider butchering costs and the freezer to put it all in. On the other hand, she does praise beans, bean soups, and grains and tells how to make them turn out best. Those are economical, and, if the free range chicken is place sparingly atop the rice, as she recommends, makes an extremely tasty meal while not using much of the chicken. My other problem is her statement that everything is better salted. While the average human can use (needs!) moderate amounts of salt, a lot of us are getting far too much; a significant population develops hypertension when they eat too much salt. I’d prefer to see most things prepared without much salt, if any, and those who need it can add it at the table. Simple enough to just ignore her statements about salt and not put it in when following her recipes, but I’m not sure the world needs a voice telling it that such and such NEEDS salt. Adler has a elegant, rambling way of writing. Some sections are lovely; others drag slowly to the point. There are only a few recipes; they are of the ‘see how simple this is?’ sort to encourage people to try cooking by her methods. It’s a book for if you really want to *think* about cooking. ",4,2
11300085,An Everlasting Meal Cooking with Economy and Grace,Antigone,489,723,4,"August 21, 2014","There's something so startling about the encounter with passion. A true, full-bodied passion that's been embraced and integrated into every aspect of life. Most days my choices extend only so far as hammer and nail, and I forget the force of joy. I forget the way bliss can trip into meaning, into vibrancy, into a stunningly pigmented existential composition. I forget. Tamar Adler reminds, in prose both crisp and seductive, that passion persists as an option; that there is a world beyond the factory floor.Then there is the breed of vegetable that strides at its own pace, regardless of yours. It has a brief season and is probably laborious, needing to be shelled or shucked or peeled, then leaving you a tiny pile of its edible self.But it is invariably this vegetable that tastes so resonantly of its moment in the year that the surrounding months echo with it. There are festivals organized around this sort: in Spain there's one for the sweet leggy onions called calcots. Everyone runs out and picks them, builds big fires, roasts bushels and bushels, makes romesco sauce, and gets drunk, eating as many as they can. In Italy if a vegetable's festival is not on the calendar, it's tacitly observed: there will be picnics when the first wild asparagus arrive. This sort of vegetable is impractical if you're trying to look ahead, but is very good at making you stop and look around.One of the most common in our soil is English peas, which arrive, adamantly, in the spring...I doubt, sincerely, that I will ever religiously patronize a farmer's market. I doubt I will scale and gut a fish, contend with a brined caper, roast a butternut squash. But I will keep this book. And I will read this book again. Because I need to be reminded.",4,4

  I don't like to think of food as carbohydrates and fat because it gives an incomplete picture of how we digest. Belly laughter must burn calories, and good conversation helps speed what needs speeding.
Tamar Adler loves food and loves words. I love her writing. Two chapters in, and she's already quoted Robert Farrar Capon and C.S. Lewis. I surrendered. I adore her unabashed campaign against food waste. It reminds me of Jacques Pépin's zeal for using up leftovers. (Anybody else recall The Tightwad Gazette?)
