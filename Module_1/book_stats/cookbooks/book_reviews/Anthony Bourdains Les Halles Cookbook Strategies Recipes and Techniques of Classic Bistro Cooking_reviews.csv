40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Patrick Brown,141,2458,5,"January 5, 2008","If I were allowed to read only one cookbook (that's read, not necessarily make the recipes) this one would be it. Bourdain has that rare ability to condescend to you and motivate you to try something new at the same time. It's a mix found in the finest drill instructors, high school math teachers, and apparently, celebrity chefs. As a side note, I went to Les Halles in NYC in June of this year, and my meal SUCKED! My steak was tough, the fries, about which he rhapsodizes for page after page in this very book, were underwhelming, and the place had all the ambiance of a Denny's. I hear he isn't around there anymore. Too bad. Still one of the people I'd like to have a meal with. ",13,4
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Mark,27,15,2,"August 10, 2016","Look...I love Anthony. I've watched every episode of Cook's Tour, No Reservations and the Layover three or four times each. I've read almost all of his books. I used to eat at Les Halles back when he actually worked there. Big fan. All that being said...this cookbook just isn't very good. If you follow the recipes to the letter, what you wind up with is adequate meals that approximately appear & taste as they should on a most baseline level. Nothing more. And certainly nothing special. I've eaten at Les Halles enough to know that the recipes in this book aren't the same recipes that they use in their kitchen. To be fair, he does point out some tips and tricks that can help give the recipes a bit more ""oomph"", such as tossing some extra veal stock in, well, pretty much everything. If you know absolutely nothing about french bistro cooking, then this is as good a place to start as any, but just don't expect Les Halles quality food from the recipes presented here.",9,1 comment

40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Cynthia Paschen,700,1 follower,2,"October 19, 2010","I love Anthony Bourdain, but I don't think I will cook anything from this collection. These recipes remind me (once again) why I do not love French cooking. Too much meat, too much meat fat, not enough fresh flavor. Most of the recipes call for homemade stock (veal, chicken, beef, duck, lamb, fish) and a bit of demi-glace. Bourdain devotes several pages to stocks and demi, without mentioning anything of a roasted vegetable stock, which I make and am fond of. I make other stocks, too, mostly not to waste good bones or shrimp shells.As I should have known before purchasing this book, there are lots of recipes for veal, organ meats and fish that aren't available in Iowa. Fun to read Bourdain's kitchen stories and cooking philosophies, but not a practical book for me.",7,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Emma,14,3,5,"October 3, 2011","This cookbook has served me very well over the few years I've owned it. Love Bourdain's style, and his recipes are unbeatable. I originally bought this book on the strength of its mushroom soup recipe- simple, tasty, versatile, but the page with all the greasy stains on it which gets pulled out all the time is the Poulet Roti-- the best roast chicken recipe I've ever seen. Even with all its use, I only recently went back and read the lengthier written portions. He is a truly engaging writer and I love Les Halles even more having read it cover to cover. I don't often look to my cookbooks for a literary experience, but having read The Nasty Bits I wasn't surprised at his talent. He's at his best in Les Halles, he loves French bistro food with an uncommon passion and it's a beautiful thing to read. It earns its stripes as a literary piece and a cookbook, though it may not be a page-turner if you're not into the subject matter of technical culinary skills. At any rate, it's five stars all the way",5,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Stacy,21,37,4,"December 28, 2007","probably the funniest cookbook you'll ever read. i may not boil pounds and pounds of bones down over two days in an economy-size cooker that i don't own to make my own demi-glace, but it's not like mssr. bourdain is really standing behind me with a meat cleaver for not doing so.some recipes are totally approachable and do-able, some require more of you and maybe more than you're able to handle.one of the more enduring passages has to do with the subject of cooking lobsters, and the probable squeamishness of the cook on the proper way to kill them. i'm paraphrasing, but this was the gist of it:They're just Big Dumb Fucking Bugs that are too dumb to know when they're dead. Think what you're doing to them isn't fair, humane? You should see what they do to each other given half a chance.and thus Anthony Bourdain wins the idealogical battle on behalf of the lobster against David Foster Wallace.",4,N/A

I enjoyed the text even though I don't much care for French bistro cuisine. ",4,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Kasia,397,264,5,"June 15, 2010","When I have a serious piece of meat or an ingredient I want to show off and still manage to cook it so I can eat dinner, I reach for Les Halles cookbook by none other than Anthony Bourdain. I don't eat meat too often, I know he does and writes about it a lot, but when I do I like to treat it with respect and use it to its full potential, when I finally do indulge in it, I can think of a few other French cookbooks that I have but this one has spunk, and is so gosh darn entertaining too. It has knowledge and professional cooking instructions that bring a smile to my face whenever I create something out of it, no worries that it's just protein, the sides and veggies are totally covered (dessert too, oh boy!) and I promise, the Graitin Dauphinois recipe towards the back is one of the best, mouth watering, gooey, bubbling hot with a melting crust, the classic flavors that have been studied and paired for centuries..Eating it I feel like I just took a short cut and with luck landed on something that has been perfected for years, and I get to eat it anytime I want. I mean be prepared to scrub the pan you make it in, but it's worth it. The prefect French fry also makes an appearance, the instructions come with pictures so it's really easy. The Fennel and tomato soup in here is heavenly too, it totally made me get into soups again, I forget how healthy and tasty they can be. Basic tart dough, sauce Bechamel, herb butter, Boeuf Bourguignon ( it's a French beef stew one could say, make extra, it's so good that boyfriends decided to eat doubles) also there is a salad that brings me back to my childhood, and I haven't ran across it in books yet, to my delight frisee aux lardons is present, I omit the chicken livers, and the cheese is a new thing in it to me ( as far as the tastes I remember) but yay, it's yummy and finally here for people to see.To me, a foodie who also loves books, Bourdain is a culinary giant, and I'm lucky to catch all the recipes in my lap, this cookbooks helps! The beginning has lots of tips and tricks in a short, great chapter that should be read a few times - General Principles, for example it's insisted on to have all your ingredients chopped and ready to go, that's something many overlook, but when things start spilling and too many things need attention, peeling and chopping potatoes isn't always fun when another sauce or pasta is screaming for our attention. Processional restaurants have everything set in place, so should we. Shopping and planning, knife knowledge, learning stocks and sauces, it's all here, for those who love food and love cooking. The book has lots of strange sounding French bistro recipes but they are pretty rustic and basic, with really good balance of flavors and with perfect cooking instructions. I think many who enjoy food will find familiar favorites here from Steak au poivre to Vichyssoise, and with a tasty dessert menu, hazelnut torte anyone? This has my whole taste bud topography covered.The last pages have invaluable info, more reading material recommended by Bourdain, various suppliers and stores that are reachable online and a great glossary, all told form his view, few curse words here and there and the book is totally his. The best way to check this book out is to read it first, I read all my cookbooks before I use them, like a little manual into the chef's psyche, almost as fun as cooking itself.",3,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Sommer,42,3,5,"January 15, 2008","I fell in love with this book the moment I opened it up to some random spot in the middle and the first sentence I read included the word ""fuck."" Nothing like one of the naughtier of the four letter words in a cook book. I heart Anthony Bourdain.",3,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Ben Stiefel,73,3,3,"January 4, 2010","this book is what it says it is, it's Tony Bourdain's recipes from Les Halles along with his style of commentary. I like the recipes, if only for the same reasons I like the recipes in the French Laundry Cookbook - I probably won't make most of them, but they're something to aspire to, or adapt to my own abilities (for instance, i'm NOT going to make veal stock any year soon... it's just over the top when you're normally cooking for 2. Demi-glace from D'artagnon however? that I will buy). I've been reading/watching/enjoying/aurally assaulted by Bourdain's style for about 8 years now, and while I'm not sick of it, it's no longer as edgy or entertaining as it once was... it's certainly not this book's fault, as it was written 6 years ago now, but because i'm reading it this late, i've already been more than exposed, so i'm not finding it as good as i once might have... That said, the recipes are great, and the instructions are obviously FROM Tony Bourdain, rather than from an editor or test chef, trying to codify what ""a handful of herbs"" means in ounces or tablespoons, so you can follow them well enough. The Red Wine Butter has already changed my life, for example (it's exactly that, reduce red wine with shallots in a small pot, add to soft butter in a food processor and mix. The result is fantastic, and excellent for melting on just about any grilled/roasted meat you can wave at it...)",2,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Sara,7,10,4,"July 14, 2009","As a huge cookbook reader and a Bourdain fan, this one rates top shelf placement in my collection. From the perspective of a plain old, ordinary cookbook, it's great: bright, sexy photographs, clearly printed recipes, nicely organized into sensible (not kitchy) sections. Everything I look for.The recipes are presented in an unusual fashion. They begin with the standard ingredient list, but the step by step instructions read like prose: he's teaching you how to create the dish the way your mom or dad or whoever taught you how to cook when you first started. What to look for, what it should smell like, how it should sound when it's cooking at the right temperature. Oh yes, and he swears. Often.It also includes sections on essentials: how to choose, use and care for a good knife, how to find and procure the best ingredients, recommended reading for the curious cook (more than just Le Technique by Jacques Pepin, thank you Tony).Short review: it's beautiful and ballsy. Just like its author.PS: Having now used a few od the recipes, I can add that they are as easy to follow as I'd hoped. The roast chicken recipe is now my standard, and the gratin dauphonoise (potatoes) is a creamy, delicious treat! ",2,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Lane Hinson,5,1 follower,3,"March 3, 2008","Yes, only I would have a cook book sitting in my living room on my coffee table. A good read full of plenty of useful hints, techniques and some great recipes. Many of them are classic french but are a lot easier to get through than Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which I found to be a little bit dated. It's also filled with plenty of anecdotes, funny witticisms and classic Bourdain instructions. If you're just starting to try and recreate a good boueff bourginon or a cassoulet, then I'd definitly suggest picking this one up. ",2,N/A
40137,Anthony Bourdains Les Halles Cookbook Strategies Recipes and Techniques of Classic Bistro Cooking,Afiq Asyran,64,19,4,"November 9, 2011","I love the introduction by Bourdain himself in first few pages of Les Halles Cookbook. I enjoy it as much as I enjoy reading Kitchen Confidential over and over again especially the part How to Cook Like Pros. And he elaborate that subject in the beginning of this book, Part A, B and C. From what you need to have in the kitchen, how to prepare your mise en place, stocks, the basic. The recipes (France Cooking) looks nice, easy to cook and most importantly feasible technique in preparing it to make sure you can cook it fast, efficient. -1star for this book becauseof lack of pictures in it.",2,N/A

The classic French bistro recipes (taken from Bourdain's restaurant in New York, Les Halles) are broken down and presented in such an approachable way that anyone can replicate, respect and appreciate.

Four stars because a) I like Bourdain's no nonsense yet humorous writing style and b) the book gives many helpful tips on running a kitchen. Five stars if and when I ever cook any recipe out of it. ,2,N/A
