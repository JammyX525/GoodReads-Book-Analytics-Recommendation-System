18209510,AfroVegan FarmFresh African Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed,7jane,671,251,4,"September 29, 2018","This book's theme is the connection between Africa and the Americas (particularly (souther) US, the Caribbean isles, and Brazil), though recipes presented here. Some are no doubt familiar from the author's previous books, but they have been 'remixed' here. There are 100+ recipes, many with pictures; at the end are some menu suggestions. Michael W. Twitty (author of ""the Cooking Gene"", another great book) gives the afterword. Again Terry gives us music with each recipes, and books/films with some, also. The theme is heritage, and it shows.I think this is perhaps his most balanced vegan cookbook, of the three so far. The theme is brought out clearly, and they have gives me the best urges to try the recipes. I don't list recipes from the first section here, but certainly from the others:Texas caviar on grilled rustic bread, Berbere-spiced black-eyed pea sliders, Sweet corn & ginger soup, Creamy coconut-cashew soup with okra corn & tomatoes, Peanut stew with winter vegetables & cornmeal dumplings, Tofu curry with mustard greens, Sautéed sugar snap peas with spring herbs, Citrus salad with arangula, Spinach-peanut sauce, Glazed carrot salad, Curried scalloped potatoes with coconut milk, Savory grits with slow-cooked collard greens, Chermoula tempeh bites, Lemongrass boiled peanuts, Skillet cornbread with pecan dukkah, Ginger-pickled green beans, Fig preserves with thyme, Date-sweetened almond milk, Teff biscuits with maple-plantain spread, Ambrosia ice pops, Roselle-rooibos drink.A very delicious experience of a read, certainly the best out of three of his I've read now. Very cheery to read, and inspiring. Very worth it.",21,N/A

Or at least, like three weeks ago. As half of my family is from Southeast Texas with roots in Louisiana, much of this is the kind of food I grew up on, and feels like home. Or at least like my mom's home. It's also one of the very, very few cookbooks in which I actually read all the introductions and essays and things. It's super interesting, and gives a really good overview of the history behind many of these dishes and where they come from and why they're culturally important, and also includes music and film pairings, and now I want to read everything of Bryant Terry's! Seriously, one of my very favorite cookbooks that I read this year (and I've...kind of read a shit-ton).",13,N/A
18209510,AfroVegan FarmFresh African Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed,Michelle,46,4,4,"December 28, 2016","although i am not vegan, nor do i plan to go vegan, i do appreciate vegan cooking. this was on my list because i was curious how to include more vegan options in my family cooking that still feels like ""home"" and familiar. my family is from the south, and i'm african american....so many of the inspirations for these recipes were familiar. pros - i love that the majority of recipes do not include the seitan or tempeh. while there is some that does include it, it isn't overwhelming like many vegan or vegetarian cookbooks i've come across. the recipes seem to be very accessible and do able. most have no crazy ingredients that you have to order special. there are a few which asks for particular herbs, but nothing too far out of the reach of a normal cook. although some of these use special sauces or rubs, the nice thing, he includes how to make those in the book. i loved how each recipe has an inspirational song, or book to further explore the culture. the only con:i wish the book had more photos, and photos which named what was in the photo. that is it.this is a book that is going on my ""to be purchased"" list for my personal library.

18209510,AfroVegan FarmFresh African Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed,Madam Book Worm &#x1f380;,88,13,5,"June 9, 2020","This is actually my SECOND read of this book and honestly my first read ratings were not good but as you will see how and why that changed DRASTICALLY. I read this book a while back when I was thinking of changing to plant based. It wasn’t a good fit because I was so unfamiliar with a lot of items and terms. But now that I’m a little bit more mature in eating this way, I understood just about everything. Also I was a law student so I didn't have the time to invest in cooking and it was one of the first vegan cook books I picked up. I was saying no to every dish. Now I have more time and my taste buds have changed, which is why I picked this book back up. I know it sounds weird to read a COOKBOOK from cover to cover but this is one that you must read from cover to cover.The research and the time and effort put in this book is beyond amazing. He studied other cookbooks and cultures. If it were me, it would take me about 4-5 years to write this book but I would never be able to bring everything together as he did. He speaks about the slave market for African, African Americans, Jamaicans, Haitians and several others. He is obviously a culinary historian and I was glad he unapologetically shared these things with me in his book. He explains the history of the food and the benefit of the food to our bodies. Additionally, I appreciate the strategic naming of each recipe. For example, there is a drink recipe called Black Queen that reminded the author of elegant Southern aunties which prompted him to name the drink “BLACK QUEENS”. Further, he recommends books and music that represents artist and authors from that area that the recipe was inspired. Some of the books I’ve recently add to my “to read pile.” For music, if the food includes Ingredients for a Caribbean, African or Louisiana cuisine, he will recommend an author or a song from someone who is in or from the region. For example, for a creole based meal-there’s a song by Lil Wayne because creole is big in Louisiana and lil Wayne is from Louisiana. There are plenty of songs I don’t know from all over the world, but I will give all of them a listen to expand my pallet. (I’m glad streaming music is so easy right now). With each recipe, he tells you what it would be best served with. He also highlights what flavors will attach to your taste bud for each dish so you can get the flavor profile of the dish. So you would know if the dish is something you should try. I love the menu suggestion that create a full menu based on recipes in the book. He tells you how to pick fresh fruits from the store or the market to get the best items. For example, pick pineapples that are fragrant at the stem. Pick mangoes that are soft to touch and have a fruity aroma. He also shares when is the best season to buy certain items. When I was a kid, I always read books about places my mom could never take me. This book has taken me to Brazil￼￼, Ghana, Caribbean, ￼￼Cameroon, Egypt, Morocco, Louisiana, The South, North Carolina, Kenya, ￼Senegal, Salvador, Haiti and so many other places. I felt like a kid all over again.The only con is I don’t know where I’m going to get some of the ingredients. For example, stuff-like orange blossom water or persimmon, or Teff Flour. I wish there was a glossary in the back of the book to describe some of the unknown items and where to generally get them from. But other people may not have an issue with this because of the power of ordering anything online. Favorite Quote: “It is not enough to celebrate the food of the African diaspora without appreciating the people who gave birth to this rich culinary heritage.” Without hesitation, I would recommend this book to anyone. This is the most well researched cookbook, I’ve ever came across. Thank you Bryant! I will be trying several of these recipes because now I’m a chef right?",5,N/A

Inside the book, beautiful photographs depict the recipes marvelously. Each recipe has a suggested 'theme song', or 'soundtrack'. I thought that was neat. I am so excited about this unusual recipe book! African, Caribbean, and southern food are all known and loved as vibrant and flavor-packed cuisines.

Awesome spice mixes, menu suggestions, song and book recommendations for recipes, and even a little touches of history. Not for the beginner cook, but someone comfortable in the kitchen will find it a welcome addition. I wish there were more photographs, and, as always, I wish people wouldn't wax on about how great the farmer's market fresh fruit for dessert is. Who has the time or the money to go to the farmer's market? Seriously. Not people with fast-food or retail jobs, that's for sure. /rant",2,N/A

Afro-Vegan offers modern takes on African, Caribbean and Southern recipes while emphasizing the history of the dishes, ingredients and farm to table practices.What I particularly love is that he has a song recommendation for every recipe which is awesome for someone like me who enjoys listening to music while cooking.

Despite the recipes being delicious, I do wish that the recipes had an estimated time for how long it would take to cook because most of these recipes are very elaborate. It's definitely not an everyday cooking cook book. Its more like a cooking on a special holiday or day off book. Also, the ingredients he suggests are often pretty hard to come by at a regular grocery store. I would recommend this book as a treat, for when you feel like doing some rigorous cooking with some pretty pricey ingredients on your day off :)",1 like,N/A
18209510,AfroVegan FarmFresh African Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed,Kathleen,395,78,5,"December 27, 2015",Bryant Terry's books demonstrate that a life of pleasure can be entirely consistent with living a life committed to social justice. Terry's recipes are fantastic. He makes delicious food. But what I love even more than his great culinary gift is his commitment to grounding and orienting his food in the rich traditions of the African Diaspora. Terry is working for food justice within a community that is underserved in terms of access to healthy foods and medical care. He presents his food as a means of community self-empowerment and a celebration of the arts and culture of the Black diaspora. I love this book. And I am grateful that there's a Bryant Terry out there in the world.,1 like,N/A
18209510,AfroVegan FarmFresh African Caribbean and Southern Flavors Remixed,Prima Seadiva,426,5,4,"August 2, 2015","I would highly recommend this. I am liking a number of the recipes. I am not a vegan but do like to eat lots of fresh vegetable dishes and this offers some new ideas particularly for some classics I grew up with like black eyed peas and greens. It's fairly easy to adapt many of the recipes to your own liking. The seasoning blends appealed to me. My basil is almost ready to harvest and make into Basil Salt.A nice plus is each recipe has a music suggestion and sometimes a book or movie suggestion as well. I'm familiar with some,some others I have checked out on line and put together a nice new music playlist. ",1 like,3

So, it's also a great read besides being a cookbook. So far, I've tried about 4 recipes, they turned out very good, they offer an interesting fusion of various traditions. They can be quite labor-intensive and time consuming, and likely need to go grocery shopping for specific ingredients, but if you decide to make a date out of the shopping, preparation, cooking, and eating, you'll have lot of fun (like I did!)",1 like,N/A

No nutrition information and old school measurements are used. Some recipes look heavy on salt and oil, but nowhere near as crazy as Anglo-southern cooking. This is a fusion cookbook, so don't expect to create a country specific menu. Lots of spice mixes and condiment recipes included along with mains, sides and drinks. I will have to try a few recipes before I can rate it.I have tried a couple of recipes now, tasty!",1 like,N/A

I have a bad habit of acquiring cookbooks and not using them for months, but I bought this beauty at the perfect time- made 4 recipes in a week! This is a rare cookbook where I use the recommended spice quantities and it's sufficiently flavorful- and the first vegan cookbook I've used that resembles how I like to eat. Be warned, this is not for the beginner cook and the recipes are time consuming. With experience you can come up your own shortcuts.",1 like,N/A
