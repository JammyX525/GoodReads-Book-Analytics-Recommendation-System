1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Punk,"1,495",235,4,"January 15, 2010","Cookbook. Here's the deal, you take flour, warm water, salt, and yeast. Toss it in a bowl, stir a little. You're done. Let the bowl sit on the counter for two hours and you can grab a hunk of dough, shape it into a ball and bake it. Seriously, it's that easy. Put that bowl of dough in the fridge and it will last for days, and you can make pretty much anything out of it, sometimes three or four servings of anything, and you'd never know it was no-knead bread.This book explains the theory behind this no-knead approach, goes over the ingredients and materials needed to make it, and offers several base doughs, as well as recipes for specialty breads. There are a few brown and white photographs throughout the book, with a group of color inserts in the middle.The ""discovery that revolutionizes home baking"" is a big deal. The cookbook is only fair to middling. The base doughs are the most important part and there's about ten of those. I felt like some of the recipes are padding, things to eat with bread rather than breads themselves, and I wanted more color photographs. For me, photographs are the thing that makes me want to try a recipe; plus you get an idea of what the finished product should look like.Five stars for the method. It's wonderful for people who love fresh bread but don't have the time/energy/ability/mindfulness to make traditional breads. Three stars for the cookbook.",39,N/A

I will make bread my facebook profile picture! I will send people valentines featuring photos of bread.1. I made bread from scratch with the help of 2 four year olds. This indicates how easy the Five Minutes a Day method it.2. My bread crackled when it came out of the oven. Hearts.3. My husband later said jealously, ""I'm not bread. Look at me, not at the bread."" He was telling me a story and I was expressing joy and contentment over my new loaves. This indicates that I love bread.4. The bread was delicious.",20,4
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Ruth,5,4,5,"December 31, 2008","My first batch of dough is now in the fridge ready for our first loaf in the morning. I know purists may scoff at the premise of this book, but if this is a way I can have real bread each day, with that great smell in the morning, and my kids eat it, then rock on. Josh loved to see how much the dough rose.The idea is to make a big wet batch of dough that you keep in the fridge for a week, taking off a chunk each morning and cooking it. Taking the ""no-knead"" idea one more step.***Update - yum! Great crusty bread. Fast and easy. Kids and I demolished the (small) loaf. Ready for the next one tomorrow***First batch made three loaves and a pizza. We're half way through a light wheat dough batch. It's incredible to have fresh bread on tap whenever we want it.

1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,HeatherAnne Norbury,204,4,5,"August 9, 2016","Starting at the title, I was VERY skeptical. I mean, really? Yummy, beautiful homemade bread in 5 minutes a day? Who do they think they're kidding? I have always wanted to bake... to BE someone who BAKES. I even own a top of the line bread machine to help this time-crunched mama (ostensibly) make bread more easily. Even as ""easy"" as that is, it still just didn't happen all that often. And frankly, bread machine crusts are just not the same as bread baked in the oven.Skeptical or not, I really wanted to believe that I could fit baking into my daily life. The introduction did nothing to make it sound any less ""too good to be true"". Then they shared their secrets: 1) ""Mix enough dough for several loaves and store it in the refrigerator"" and 2) ""Pre-mixed, pre-risen, high moisture dough keeps well in the refrigerator."" (my emphasis). This dough is WET and as a result, requires no kneading, no proofing the yeast, no resting/rising/resting, no punching down (in fact, NEVER punch it down), no stress or fuss whatsoever. With my trusty kitchen scale and my Kitchenaid mixer, I can put a large batch of dough together in under 15 minutes. The only thing I have to do each day for fresh bread is pull off a ball of dough, shape and bake. There is some resting and baking time involved, of course, but the actual active work required takes mere minutes. I have even cooked a few loaves in the slow cooker (!!!) with zero resting time. You do need to put a slow cooker loaf under a broiler for a minute to crisp up the top but this is a super SUPER easy way to make already super easy bread.I usually get books from the library first before forking out the cash for them. I will definitely be adding this one to my cookbook collection permanently. They also have written ""Healthy Bread in 5 Minutes a Day"" and ""Artisan Pizza and Flatbread in 5 Minutes a Day"". This review is for the 2nd edition of their original book and I plan to buy this one as it includes whole grain and flatbread recipes in it, as well as recipes for pretzels, pain d'epi, pumpernickel, rye, beignets, naan and so much more. There is a sizable gluten-free section as well! If you want to fit baking into your life, do yourself a favor and get this book. I'm not sure your waistline will thank me but your taste buds definitely will. ",8,N/A

How radical.Argh!If you can stand the frenetic tone of these two you will find their so-called brilliant innovations are:1. If your yeast is fresh you can skip the proofing step, this will save approximately 5 seconds of prep time.2. If you use a wet dough you can skip kneading, the only risk is that your bread may not rise. In which case, call it flat bread. Bakers realized this about 12,000 B.C.E.3. You can store a mix of flour, water and yeast for a long time, using bits as needed to make fresh bread. Pliny the Elder wrote about this nearly 2000 years ago.4. You can buy pizza stones, terra cotta cloches and all manner of equipment for making bread that will taste just as good as bread made with a bowl, a little mixing and a cookie sheet.Of course, if you follow their instructions you get to squeal about how REVOLUTIONARY it all is, as they do.",7,2
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Teri,97,16,4,"May 20, 2009","The theory here is that you make a big batch of dough one day then stick it in your fridge for up to 2 weeks (it becomes more like sourdough the longer it is in there) then it is ready when you want it, hence the 5 minutes a day. It's an amazingly simple recipe with no kneading required (my favorite feature), however it is ""artisan bread"" so I have to remind myself not to expect a big loaf of soft crusted wheat bread. My results were good though. A little round loaf with crusty outside and chewy inside. Some recipes were too fancy and unappealing - Aubergine Tartine anyone? - but others were perfect - soft pretzels - and some I have yet to try - spinach feta bread. Anyway, it's kind of weird that the longest review I have ever written is for a cookbook but, thanks Glenna, for letting me borrow it and I will return it before school is out for sure!",6,21
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Micah Wallace,16,1 follower,2,"June 7, 2011","First, the positive: this is the book that started me baking bread. A complete baking novice, I read the article in Mother Earth News, bought the book, and found that it really was an easy, fool-proof recipe. The idea of keeping a large amount of dough in the fridge to use as needed is the most useful idea in the book. And it's not bad bread. But it could easily be better. Cut back on the yeast, cut back on the salt, and give the initial rise more time. The flavor improves, the crumb opens up and you save a TON on yeast. Once I started making other no-knead recipes, especially the fantastic Almost no-knead from Cook's Country, I stopped using this book and haven't gone back since. While it's certainly not my favorite bread, it was the reason I started baking in the first place. It deserves credit for turning countless non-bakers into breadmakers. If you're interested, get it from the library or find the recipe on the Mother Earth News website and try it before you go out and buy it.",5,N/A
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Darby,366,43,5,"January 11, 2009","This book is getting 5 stars although I wished it had 4 1/2 because I feel the title is misleading (not really 5 minutes a day). Otherwise this book is FANTASTIC. It is one I would like to own. I have only made the master recipe so far but it worked really well. I even did them in loaf pans instead of free form and also used it for a pan of cinnamon rolls. I have a bread machine that I love and use often but what stops me from using it a lot is - time even though it does save time. With this book it tells you how to make up a big batch of ""wet"" dough and store it in your fridge for 5 to 14 days (depending on recipe) and then pull from it and make bread daily or every other day - whatever works for you. It says 5 minutes a day because you pull the dough off the big batch you made already and shape - in 5 minutes. But the rising time is still quite long so don't think just because you pulled it out that in 40 minutes to an hour you will have fresh bread. It took my bread often 2 hours to raise to the size I wanted it. I live in high altitude and this bread still turned out perfect. I did have to decrease the flour some and increase the water a bit. But still they book really helps you trouble shoot and it helped me not feel so intimidated by baking bread without my bread machine. I feel the recipes of this book are going to be mainstays in our home. I don't doubt there will always be a tub of dough going in our fridge. ",4,N/A
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Jeff,64,11,3,"June 15, 2009","A dough recipe that you can make in large batches and refrigerate!The process is a little different from making traditional doughs, but it's streamlined.It's perfect for somebody who wants a loaf of bread in 30 minutes instead of 2.5 hours. I find that I'm not willing to put in that much time/effort all at once unless it's a weekend.The book centers itself around one master recipe, and the other recipes are versatile modifications. I've baked 8 loaves of the master recipe and haven't gotten sick of it yet. Sometime soon I'll try the others.",4,1 comment
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Amanda ,737,36,5,"March 20, 2021","We're in what the weather service calls a ""prolonged period of bitterly cold temperatures and dangerous windchills."" The windchill was -50°F this morning. A good time to stay inside and add warmth to our home by baking! I've had a copy of this book for many years and used to make the boule recipe in it. I'm not sure why I ever stopped. I started a batch today, it's so simple and satisfying to make. I read the whole book through and look forward to trying more recipes and variations. It's a great cookbook, I like the layout and writing style.Between Bea Ojakangas and this book, I've been all kinds of inspired by fellow Minnesotans to bake bread lately.3/20/21 Update: A baking stone and bread peel are required equipment for most recipes. It takes a little practice to master the transfer of dough from the peel to the hot stone, but once you've got it down it's very rewarding. The peasant loaves are gorgeous. The olive dough / Neapolitan pizza crust is amazing. My family can't get enough of homemade pizza nights. Fun, and really fast. We'll (hopefully) never eat frozen pizzas again. My 14 year old son says it beats all the big pizza chains. We like using boule loaves for grilled sandwiches, grilled cheese, or ham and Swiss on rye. When grilled, it's both chewy and crunchy - delicious.I've also used boule dough to make hamburger buns for grilled venison burgers. My 18 year old son said they were the best he's ever had.",3,3
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Audrey,328,35,5,"May 8, 2011","Five minutes a day is a bald-faced lie but I suppose if you count only the minutes your hands are actually on the dough, it's probably around five minutes. The directions for making the dough is confusing at first (what's a gluten cloak?) but once you get the hang of it, it's all good. Most of the breads came out fantastic - a crunchy outer crust and a nice, firm but moist inside with a nice chewiness to it. The authors recommend a bunch of baking equipment (from Williams-Sonoma, I believe) but if you don't want to spend $50 on a pizza stone, for example, you'll be fine. I don't have a pizza stone or a pizza peel so I simply use a cornmeal-dusted sheet of foil on a cookie sheet and all of my boule-formed loaves came out great. The bread recipes seem to be fairly forgiving if you do the ingredient ratios correctly.There's a bunch of non-bread recipes in there too which look good but I haven't tried making any yet. Two breads I was more or less indifferent to was the Portuguese broa and the light wheat bread. The only recipe that came out bad was the pumpernickel, which tasted like wheat bread flavored with coffee. It sounds alright but the taste was just odd. Maybe it's because I left out the caramel coloring. Anyway, my favorites that I made a dozen times at least totally made up for the so-so breads. The brioche is a very dense and delicious eggy bread with a touch of sweetness from the honey. It also made the apartment smell AMAZING. The European peasant bread (which had regular all-purpose flour, wheat, and rye) is wonderful with anything. The Master Recipe boule is great too. I'll try making the bagels next. ",3,N/A
1009996,Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day The Discovery That Revolutionizes Home Baking,Karmologyclinic,248,33,1,"December 30, 2021","I wonder if people giving this book 4 and 5 stars really know what good artisan bread tastes like...I consider myself a proficient baker and I can follow with success very complicated pastry and baking recipes. This method produces a loaf that has only a similarity to bread and tastes like flour. No thanks. You want a bread with 5 minutes per day? Buy a kitchen mixer. Mix the dough for f- sake for 5 f-ing minutes. Wait to rise. There you have it, bread with 5 active minutes per day, the rest is waiting time anyway, there is no bypass for waiting time when you deal with yeast.",3,N/A

So I couldn't resist this title when it came up for sale for Kindle. I have used Hertzberg's basic dough recipe from an earlier book, but wanted to try something new. Not only does this book offer recipes, but it offers many tips of the trade (why certain flours affect bread in different ways, lean vs. enriched doughs, how to parbake bread, etc.) An especially helpful example: ""Cup for cup, wheat bran is much higher in fiber than whole wheat flour, yet it doesn't affect the taste of bread as much. For those who don't care for the pleasantly bitter, nutty flavor of whole wheat, this [wheat germ] loaf is a mild-tasting, high-fiber alternative."" Lots of helpful tips and a good variety of recipes. The only one I've tried so far (Oatmeal bread with Maple) was delicious.This book also includes a chapter on gluten-free breads.",3,N/A

I discovered this cookbook from a friend of mine who is also a baker at Zomick's. Some 4 years ago when I first read it, I found a real jewel of a recipe. It was an old challah recipe that traditionally originated from Eastern Europe. Till this day I'm still offering that challah bread on the shelves at Zomick's bakery. And that is just one example; there are plenty of recipes I've tried and all are excelent.",3,N/A
