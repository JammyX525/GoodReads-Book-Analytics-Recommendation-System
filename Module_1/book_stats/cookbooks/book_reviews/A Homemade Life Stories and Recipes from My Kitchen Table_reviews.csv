3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Heidi,32,7,4,"April 13, 2009","Every once in a while I come across someone who makes me wonder. What I was doing when God was handing out talent? No, really. WHAT was I doing? Begging some mid-level angel to send me to a pastry-making family in Paris while rocket-science intellect and supermodel looks were being passed out like Halloween candy two lines down?  One thing’s certain: I was not in line with author Molly Wizenberg. Actually, I’m not sure anyone was in line with her that fateful pre-mortal day. She reminds me of the kid who is the last trick-or-treater of the night so you dump the entire bowl of candy into her bag. I think God did just that – He dumped an entire bowl of talent into her bag.  Yes, this is a cookbook, but not in the glossy photo Barefoot Contessa sort of way. Instead, each recipe is introduced with an essay that is so well-written and downright charming you’ll immediately forgive Molly for not having any pictures. The essays are all I really paid attention to. I breezed past the recipes so I can’t tell you if the chocolate cake, which has enough butter to make your cardiologist gasp, is a keeper. Or if pickled grapes are as delicious as Molly promises (I’m not optimistic).  But this book isn’t about the recipes. It’s about why the recipes matter. Knowing if this book will matter to you is easy: check out Molly’s blog at http://www.orangette.blogspot.com. If you like the blog you’ll like this book. ",42,7

Along with Ruth Reichl’s Comfort Me with Apples, this tops my foodie reading of the year. I liked it even better than Delancey, which is a terrific book about opening a pizza restaurant in Seattle with her husband. Here we get the prequel: the death of her father Burg from cancer, time spent living in Paris, building a new life in Seattle, starting her now-famous food blog (Orangette), and meeting her husband Brandon through it. Each brief autobiographical essay is perfectly formed and followed by a relevant recipe, capturing precisely how food is tied up with her memories:I write about food and cooking, and in that sense, I aim to be informative, but I write about my life some, too, since it intersects with food roughly three times a day. I don’t think many of us are terribly interested in recipes that have no stories or real-life context. For me, the two are inseparable. One is pale and boring without the other.Wizenberg’s very fond of salad, but also of cake, and every recipe is full-on in terms of flavors and ingredients. None of your low-fat, cutting-corners nonsense here; just straight up delicious food. I made her chocolate cupcake recipe (in cake form) for my husband’s birthday, and I’d eat any of the other dishes described.Other favorite passages:A classic among classic French desserts, tarte Tatin is essentially a sexed-up apple pie—a housewife in stilettos, you could say. It starts with wedges of apple caramelized to a deep amber, their juices mingling with butter and sugar to yield a complex flavour that verges on hard cider. Covered with a sheet of puff pastry, baked to golden, and then inverted, the apples sit coyly atop their many-layered blanket like Ingres’s Grande Odalisque on her chaise. Dolloped with crème fraîche, tarte Tatin doesn’t dally with small talk. It reaches for your leg under the table.Like my mother before me, I’m a baker by nature: precise, obedient, and fiercely devoted to my digital scale. My mother taught me early on that a recipe should always be followed strictly the first time through, with no tweaking or second guessing. You give it an honest try, see how it goes, and then you can tinker to your heart’s content. … I find a deep, abiding satisfaction in following instructions.(all the more ironic, then, that she married a kitchen innovator who makes things up as he goes along – and is strangely obsessed with pickling things)",30,8
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Julie Ehlers,"1,111",1374,4,"January 20, 2020","A Homemade Life was an impulse read: I'd been seeing Wizenberg's forthcoming memoir being promoted around the interwebs, got curious about her stuff, noticed my library branch had a copy of her first book, checked it out, and read it pretty much right away. I knew it was based on Wizenberg's food blog Orangette (which I'd never visited), so I was expecting it to be episodic in nature, which it was. What I hadn't expected was that it would be so charming. The writing is wonderful, some of the subject matter is difficult but it's all heartwarming, the travel elements are beautifully evocative, and the recipes sound AMAZING. It's actually unfortunate that I took this out of the library because I really want to try a bunch of the dishes, so I guess I'll have to get my own copy. I read this really quickly and was sorry when it was over, and I'll be reading her second memoir ASAP. Recommended if you're looking for a fun foodie read.",22,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Cate,230,14,2,"April 21, 2009","I read this immediately after It Sucked and Then I Cried, and that was probably one too many books-based-on-blogs in a row. I don't read her blog, Orangette, but I'm guessing this material works much better in blog format. It was very lightweight.Also, while I'm glad the author and her husband are happy, she's really gushy about their relationship. She sounds very young. It's like Twilight, but with cooking instead of vampires. None of the recipes jumped out at me as anything I want to make.",16,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Jaclyn,167,35,4,"March 5, 2009","I laughed, I cried, I put bouchons au thon on my weekly menu.Molly Wizenberg is basically my generation's M.F.K. Fisher. Her recipes are fantastic, her descriptions are apt... but that all pales in comparison with the simple fact that her writing is full of life and joy. I've been a follower of her blog, Orangette, for some time now and I find I can always rely on Molly for a great recipe, wonderful story and stunning photography. But the book transcends that - it's something more. It's a glimpse into a life that, while young and nowhere near over yet, has been exceptionally well-lived. Molly is committed to eating well, laughing deeply and often, and loving joyously - and she has carried out that mission both in times of tragedy and of great happiness. I can't imagine how anyone can do better, and I'm so grateful that she shares peeks into her life every week on Orangette and in this delightful book.",15,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Beth,539,10,5,"March 27, 2009","I heard of this book from a couple of sources and decided to pick it up. I now feel that Molly Wizenberg and I are best friends, and I have not yet even visited her blog, called Orangette. Great bedtime reading, as the ""chapters"" are quite short, each ending with usually one but maybe two recipes---and then I'd tell myself, ""what would one more hurt?"" so I'd read more. Her recipes are written as prose, leading you through each step. Along the way, she writes about her childhood, (and since she is the same age as my oldest, I can relate to that), her family in great detail, her love of things French, and the entry of the love of her life. She makes such simple things so satisfying to read about, like everyday stuff we all experience, and yes, all of them are food connected. I'd really never thought about that, and it was truly food for thought, excuse the pun. I intend to check out Orangette for sure, and also intend to try her recipes--somehow I don't think they'll disappoint. Mostly, I hope you get the idea that this book was WAY more than I had expected, and I would heartily recommend it to anyone who reads this...heartily. For me, this is the height of satisfaction. If I lend it to you, I'd better get it back!",8,5
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Laurie,642,6,5,"March 7, 2009","Molly Wizenberg has a wonderfully flattering way of writing about food and people. She makes both sound delightful. While readers of A Homemade Life will wish they could sit down with Molly over salad and cheese, they will especially wish they could know all these charming people: her father, mother, husband, and various friends in Oklahoma, Paris, and Seattle. Molly describes each in a vivid way that says, ""I love this person! I want to share him with you."" And with each person comes a recipe. I am looking forward to making Burg's potato salad, Lisa's scones, Brandon's chana masala, and Molly's chocolate cake. A Homemade Life is a winning book about Molly and the people in her life. We are fortunate to get to meet them, and eat with them, too.",8,1 comment
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Gina,595,8,3,"April 3, 2009","This book encompasses two pet peeves of mine: the blog-to-book craze and the cookbook-book combination. Blogs fodder is not always great book fodder. I enjoy a well-written blog, but I am less forgiving of a book that is not so well-written. I am not saying this book is not well-written, but I do think that the flow of the stories feel more like blog posts than short stories to me. As for the cookbook/book issue, it's a personal matter of wondering where to house a book like this. Is it a proper book that should reside on the bookshelf, or is it a cookbook that should be used and show some signs of use? I enjoyed this book, and I found a few of the stories rather touching. However, I also found myself rushing through a few stories because they were too ""personal journal"" for me. Overall, this is a nice collection of recipes and their backstories. ",7,1 comment
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,jess,835,71,3,"November 16, 2009","While I am skeptical of blogs-to-books, and have spent considerable hours of my life dissecting the genre in recent months, I really wanted to love this book. First, the author lives in the PNW. Me too! (Only 60 miles north of me, Molly Wizenberg has a restaurant.) She's from Oklahoma, but left the minute she could. Hey, me too! She had a long-distance sweetheart who became her spouse. Wow! Me too! So, imagine my surprise when I, self-identified emotional sap and carbohydrate connoisseur, became the first person in the universe to not adore this book. So the first half of the book is dad stuff, family, the food, France, and a little misdirected romance of youth. Then the second half is the True Love, the marriage, and more of the food. Molly describes her LDR, the airports, the once-a-month ""vacations,"" the courtship, the marriage, and I totally get their fresh-faced new-soul worshipful love, down to the description of her spouse as ""magic,"" while he is proposing marriage over and over long after the wedding has passed. This is what I want to remember about this book, becuase I inhabit that space, too. I agree, gentle reader, it is completely and totally wrong that I liked the part about love BEST in a book about food. And Molly cooks simple, honest, earnest food with fresh, local ingredients. Her food stories sound delicious and I have heard from friends that their restaurant is pretty good. Some day I will go there and eat their heirloom tomato salad. This was a blog-book I should have adored, but it just never really measured up to my expectations. I never read Molly's blog, Orangette, even though I know it is super famous. I thought I could avoid the death trap of ""we already read all of this on your blog,"" although through some careful google-ing, I was able to determine that the book more often than not just sums up her blog. The vignettes aren't strong enough to carry the book, although many of the stories are quite funny and heartwarming and heartbreaking. By the end, I liked Molly a lot, but I do not want to read anymore of her books, which are as of yet unwritten but which I am sure she will write, because she is wildly successful and beloved.

3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Allison Floyd,483,52,3,"September 6, 2011","The problem with criticizing memoirs is that it always feels like a personal attack on their authors, particularly when the author is your age, you both have dead fathers, and maybe just maybe there’s a little green-eyed monster sitting on your shoulder hissing “Hey! I can write at least as well as this! Where are MY book deal, freelance column with Bon Appetit, travel writing assignments, and True Love?” Which is of course unseemly. Maybe if I were a regular follower of the blog, I’d get it, but…My problem with this book is best illustrated thusly: “I promised to tell you about the young Frenchman, and it is kind of a good story, so I won’t make you wait.” In response to which I can only feel like the author and I are on a bus, or in the post office, or some other uncomfortably crowded public place, and she, donning a tea cozy with a cloying lavender and pale pink floral pattern on her head, is leaning in uncomfortably close, in flagrant disregard of my space bubble, and carrying on as if we were long lost sisters. In response to which I can only suppress the urge to say, “GAH! Get thee behind me woman! I don’t even know you. We are not having a heart-to-heart over chamomile, and moreover, we NEVER will.”An unfair criticism of something that is, after all, a MEMOIR? Probably. But lesson learned: if it’s a personal food narrative and doesn’t contain some reference to bones or meat in the title, then the reading of such is probably a doomed endeavor. Nevertheless, I made it to the end, so something kept me coming back, and it’s not just the drinking of the haterade. Despite that it commits many cardinal sins (lionizing France—I mean, do we really need another memoir that does that?; frequent use of the second-person; the incorporation of a high school essay), it has its moments, and was a nice, comforting book to read during moments of insomnia and before going to bed, like warm milk (with maybe too much sugar added) for the soul.

3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Julie,585,13,4,"March 3, 2016","I'm a fan of the Spilled Milk podcast, which Molly Wizenberg does with Matthew Amster-Burton, so I was pretty sure I would like this book, and I did. I especially loved how she told the story of her romance with her husband through recipes. The descriptions of Paris made me want to get on the next plane. All in all, an engaging book. Highly recommended.",5,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Les,774,11,5,"December 3, 2021","Years ago, when I was first got into blogging, I stumbled upon some non-book related blogs filled with beautiful photographs of home interiors and delicious-looking meals that satisfied my desire to live (and appreciate) a more simple life. Shauna Ahern's blog Gluten-Free Girl was one of the first sites that caught my eye and I looked forward to each new post about her life in Seattle with her husband, who at the time was a chef at a local restaurant. It wasn't just stories about their lives, but the enticing recipes that kept me reading. It was on Shauna's blog that I learned about Molly Wizenberg (who was also living in Seattle) and started following her posts on Orangette. At the time, my husband and I were living in Nebraska and we both yearned to move to the Pacific Northwest, so I lived vicariously through these blogs with each mention of Seattle and the surrounding areas, recognizing specific places we'd been to while visiting my dad and stepmom (who were living on Lake Union on their boat during that time). As is the way of early blogs of the late 90s and early 2000s, and much to my disappointment, Gluten-Free Girl and Orangette are now defunct. However, both women have fairly recent published works, which is exciting for this lover of foodie memoirs. Shauna's collection of essays (Enough) was released in 2019 and Molly's third memoir (The Fixed Stars) was published in 2020. I've had Wizenberg's first memoir on my shelf for about a dozen years and finally pulled it from that shelf and read it this month for Nonfiction November. I don't know why I waited so long; I loved everything about it! Each chapter reveals a little bit more about Molly's childhood, time spent in France, and life as a young woman living in Seattle. The anecdotes dovetail neatly with specific recipes, many of which I have marked to someday try. Wizenberg's writing is conversational, yet polished, and the pages practically turned themselves. It was easy to read a dozen or so stories each night, telling myself, ""just one more."" Now that I've finished, I can't wait to get a copy of Delancey, which continues with Molly and Brandon's story. (Delancey is also the name of their restaurant in Seattle.)Like most people who love to cook, I like the tangible things. I like the way the knife claps when it meets the cutting board. I like the haze of sweet air that hovers over a hot cake as it sits, cooling, on the counter. I like the way a strip of orange peel looks on an empty plate. But what I like even more are the intangible things: the familiar voices that fall out of the folds of an old cookbook, or the scenes that replay like a film reel across my kitchen wall. When we fall in love with a certain dish, I think that's what we're often responding to: that something else behind the fork or the spoon, the familiar story that food tells.These are some of the recipes that I'd like to sample (listed for future reference):Burg's Potato SaladBlueberry-Raspberry Pound CakeBanana Bread with Chocolate and Crystallized GingerBurg's French ToastChocolate Cupcakes with Bittersweet GlazeHoosier PieFresh Ginger Cake with Caramelized PearsDutch Baby Pancakes with Lemon and SugarJimmy's Pink CookiesDoron's Meatballs with Pine Nuts, Cilantro, and Golden RaisinsCider-Glazed SalmonFrench-Style Yogurt Cake with LemonButternut Soup with Pear, Cider, and Vanilla BeanCaramelized Cauliflower with Salsa VerdeThe Winning Hearts and Mind CakeA Homemade Life is certain to appeal to readers who loved Laurie Colwin's Home Cooking, Ann Hood's Kitchen Yarns, and Ruth Reichl's Tender at the Bone.",4,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,SheReaders Book Club,336,31,5,"April 23, 2018","I have long loved Molly’s Spilled Milk Podcast with Matthew AB and knew that I would eat up her book as well but even going in with that mindset, I was still pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed and whizzed through this book! I couldn’t find it for the longest time (I know, the internet). I insist on being thrifty when it comes to books. I like it to feel more like a treasure hunt and a major win when you find one that you’ve been pining for. Thank you, library used book sale for this wonderful prize! I’m going to give it to my Grandma and then make some of those recipes to share. There are no photos in this book which I came to appreciate because your imagination works great and you are never disappointed with your own results when comparing to a professional photo. This also made me pay more attention to the recipes and the assembly of each dish instead of just looking at a picture and making up my own methods.",4,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Kerri,435,2,3,"October 7, 2018","Pleasant but not overly deep book. Well, it's basically reading a blog. Sometimes the posts work. Sometimes they don't. The married for 18 year part of me found the romance portions eye rolling worthy but the part of me with aging parents found the middle section deeply moving. ",3,N/A
3090282,A Homemade Life Stories and Recipes from My Kitchen Table,Tina Culbertson,537,19,5,"October 8, 2012","Molly really spoke to me. I read this book and I felt I was having a conversation with her. Some bits were like reading a letter from someone I knew well, someone who poured out their heart and feelings. She is so much younger than I am but I sure could relate to so many things she wrote about. From the unresolved feelings regarding her father’s death to the cautious delight of falling in love with her soul mate. The calm and focus that creeps in when you are immersed in preparing food for people you love and her unapologetic Francophile side. (seems so many are determined to hate the French these days…)In the beginning of the book she talks about the clean-as-you-go rule (I always do, it’s just easier) and warns to read recipes all the way through before you start. Oh, how I wish I could adhere to that golden rule! I always have the intent but…ya know, there are just too many times I started a recipe and found I was missing a key ingredient. This causes undue swearing and sometimes, an extra trip to the market.Integrated into her story are recipes. The recipes are like a timeline of her life – the eye-rolling, teenaged viewpoint of her father as he declares, “You know, we eat better at home than most people do in restaurants,” but realizing the importance of “the steady rhythm of meeting in the kitchen every night, sitting down at the table, and sharing a meal.”There are so many good recipes it’s difficult to choose one so…I’ll tell you what all I tried so far. If you'd like to see photos and recipes please check me out at Squirrel Head Manor. I have made the Ed Fretwell Soup as this was an important recipe to honor her friend Ed, and to push on people at the Grief counseling. It was cathartic for Molly to be involved in the preparation of dish she associated with grief and her father…and healing.Prepared the Spring Salad with Endive, Avocado and Goat Cheese after reading that uber romantic way Brandon proposed – with those confiscated special diamonds!I made Cornbread with the creamy middle because this chapter described her revelation that girls do sometimes marry their fathers..hahaha…The Dutch Baby Pancake, well…I really like pancakes and this was the soufflé of pancakes !It’s in the works to make the wedding cake or, as she calls it, The cake of Winning Hearts and Minds as well as the French-Style Yogurt cake with lemon.My plan, which went spectacularly off course, was to start with the Yogurt Cake because this was the recipe which brought Molly and Brandon together. If it were not for that cake, he wouldn’t have written to Molly. And of course you just have to end the post (which I am having an epic fail here) with the wedding cake. It’s the start of Molly and Brandon’s life together. Plus it’s a wicked looking recipe which promises (I just know it!) a decadently rich chocolatey slice of a fine cake.So, one of my favorites, so far…if I have to pick one is this Spring Salad with Avocado…..wow! Fresh ingredients such as avocado, radishes, endive and creamy goat cheese, how could you go wrong.One of my favorite quotes is from the introduction:“When I walk into my kitchen today, I am not alone. Whether we know it or not, none of us is. We bring fathers, and mothers and kitchen tables and every meal we have ever eaten. Food is never just food. It’s also a way of getting at something else: who we are, who we have been and who we want to be. When my father sat down to the dinner table, he saw more than what was on his plate. He saw his childhood as the son of two Polish immigrants; his youth in a working class neighborhood in the 1930s………..”And this paragraph goes on to describe his life. When Molly walked into her kitchen, she brought all this with her.If you haven’t read this book, this memoir, it is one I recommend. I enjoyed it enough to stop checking it out of the library and purchase a copy. For the memories, for the food, for a good story. ",3,N/A
