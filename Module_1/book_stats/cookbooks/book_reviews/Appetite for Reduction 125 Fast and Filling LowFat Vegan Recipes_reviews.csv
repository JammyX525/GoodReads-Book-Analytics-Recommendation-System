8070469,Appetite for Reduction 125 Fast and Filling LowFat Vegan Recipes,Elevate Difference,379,77,5,"May 4, 2011","My library copy of Vegan with a Vengeance shouldn’t have been returned. Not in the state it was in after it lived in my kitchen for five renewed status cycles (the maximum number I was allowed before I had to return it to my local library). The book shouldn’t have been returned because it smelled like food. A cookbook, naturally, absorbs the effort of its teachings: oils and buttered thumb prints, dried arrow root smudges, and one small berry stain on two of the pages when I tried to turn them with fruit juice-stained fingers. Luckily, I don’t have to return Isa Chandra Moskowitz’s newest book, Appetite for Reduction, which is doomed to the same fate as its predecessor: lovingly used with pages that are turned with excitement, torn at its edges and bearing of all kinds of quirky marks, compliments of the daring cook.Moskowitz discloses her personal health reasons that resulted in her decision to find more recipes that are lighter in caloric intake. She also stresses her reluctance to contribute to the war on bigger bodied women. So what does Moskowitz do? She writes a cookbook for vegan stomachs searching lowfat, delicious recipes. For those in the vegan community who are also health conscious, Moskowitz has delivered the goods on a plate too irresistible to deny.Isa Chandra Moskowitz is the best friend we’re all looking for: she writes in a way we understand, a language that is easily understood and humorous. She is also the cook we want for our healthy lives and families. She gets it. She gets that we don’t want to give up taste and satisfaction for healthy living. With this book, she dismantles the notion that vegan eating and cooking is not either extreme of the rumor spectrum. Veganhood is not bland rabbit food, nor is it substituting large amount of full fat in place of flavor.From funky hummus creative ideas to “OMG Oven-Baked Onion Rings,” from sides to satisfying full entrée ideas, Moskowitz turns your vegan kitchen upside down, shakes out the fat, and replaces it with novel and tasty ideas to keep your mind interested and your tongue happy you tried something new. For this, I raise my spatula to Moskowitz with a need and heartfelt thank you. Vegan or omnivore, you will find something to rave about and savor in Appetite for Reduction.Written by: Lisa Factora-Borchers",16,2
8070469,Appetite for Reduction 125 Fast and Filling LowFat Vegan Recipes,Maggie,60,4,5,"November 13, 2011","I'm not a vegan. In fact, I'm not even a vegetarian. But I am someone who likes a variety of foods and is always looking for fast, healthy recipes. I bought this book after being a fan of Isa's Post Punk Kitchen website, and a few months later, I can say it was a great investment.I've really liked every recipe I've tried from this book. The writing style here is friendly, funny, and very easy to follow. There are a few more involved recipes, but there are plenty for when you're crunched for time and still want to eat something fresh and healthy. The nutrition information is provided for every recipe, as is information about whether or not the recipe is gluten- or soy-free, and there's a great introduction that talks about the different vitamins and minerals we get from fresh vegetables. A few of my friends are vegans, and a few also have wheat allergies, so I'm thrilled to have plenty of recipes to choose from if I'd like to cook for them. I highly recommend this cookbook for herbivores and omnivores alike (even if you decide to add a little bacon to your black-eyed peas and collards...)",12,N/A
8070469,Appetite for Reduction 125 Fast and Filling LowFat Vegan Recipes,Lisa Vegan,"2,734",1200,5,"January 3, 2011","A cookbook doesn’t have to be perfect for me to give it 5 stars. This is a 5 star book for me. It’s more perfect than most. Yes, I don’t use salt when I cook and I’d use even less oil than appears in some of these recipes, trying to lose weight or not, but most of the recipes are innovative and creative in how to maximize flavor using mostly healthy ingredients. The world isn’t the way it was when I first went vegan and, before that when I first went vegetarian. Now very available are plentiful vegan junk foods, vegan desserts, and other high caloric density, high fat, high sugar, and heavily processed vegan foods. So, I welcome books such as these, especially because over the past couple of months I’ve started losing some of the weight I gained over six and a half years ago when I hurt my knees and had to severely reduce my activity level. (This is the second weight control focused vegan cookbook I’ve read recently. The other book was Color Me Vegan: Maximize Your Nutrient Intake and Optimize Your Health by Eating Antioxidant-Rich, Fiber-Packed, Color-Intense Meals by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau, who is another Goodreads’ author member.) The author of this book does share some of why she wanted to create these recipes and, yes, a part of it was the time she spent writing her all vegan cupcakes book. As is usual for this author, the book is written in an entertaining way; it’s fun to read. I do appreciate that she pays attention to cost and alerts the reader about costly ingredients.I love the layout and organization of this book, even though all the photos are in the center (with page number of the recipes, which is helpful.) About 36 of the recipe results are photographed; in some photos two or three dishes appear together. I wish every recipe had an accompanying photo; the ones that are there look fabulous!There is a mini nutrition lesson at the beginning of the book that I did not need, but for novices to vegan eating or nutrition, it’s a good addition. The second listed author of the book is a R.D.The recipes have icons for: gluten-free, soy-free, 30 minutes or under, and downtime. (I love downtime!) Throughout the book there are text boxes for: tip, nutrition tip, note, bulk it up, ingredient scavenger hunt, etc.For each recipe there is quite a bit of additional information given: number of servings, active time, total time, and per serving calories, calories from fat, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat (I think always 0), total carb, fiber, sugars, protein, cholesterol (definitely always 0 since all the recipes are vegan), sodum, and (%) vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. All sorts of recipe preparation tips are given. I like that she gives steaming times for various vegetables, variations for hummus, variations for marinara sauce, and other such useful information. Best of all, in addition to the regular index, there is a recipe by icon appendix too. Even better, virtually all the recipes look quick and easy to prepare, and the author makes following these recipes look so doable. Some recipes that looked particularly enticing to me are lasagna with roasted cauliflower ricotta & spinach, baked falafel, Bistro broccoli chowder, Edamame pesto for pasta dishes, Arabian lentil & rice soup, yam & black bean soup with orange & cilantro, cauliflower mashed potatoes (caulipots), polenta stuffing, oven-baked onion rings, mushroom & cannellini paprikas, eggplant-chickpea curry, chipotle chili with sweet potatoes & Brussels sprouts, lentil & eggplant chili mole, fresh corn & scallion corn bread, sweet potato drop biscuits, cauliflower pesto soup, tortilla soup, guacamole, and (amazing because I very rarely like any salad dressings) green goddess garlic dressing.Contents:IntroductionMetric Conversion ChartMission: NutritionAbout the Recipe IconsChapter 1.

I feel like I should be listening to my GNR tape while reading.The author, straightaway, makes it known that this is not our mother’s low-fat cookbook. (Thank God!). She then pointed out that the book was designed with the busy week night chef in mind (can we get a second thank God?!).The author promises I’ll become the mayor of the produce aisle. Hot damn! I can’t wait for the inaugural ball.The writer is very tongue-in-cheek (don’t worry that is vegan friendly, I checked). In speaking of the salads of yore she states: “there was a time, a lonely lonely time, when salads were a pale and limp affair, regulated to the side of your plate, practically weeping. I think those dark days were also known as the 80s”. HahaShe then closes the salad paragraph with: “sometimes it’s nice to time travel back to those days when haircuts for asymmetrical, Axl ruled the airwaves, and the salad was just a salad”. She's a hoot!!The fact that Isa uses “lettuce begin” as a paragraph opener surely must mean we were separated at birth!Full disclosure: although there are not a gaggle of colorful photos in the book I felt they were not necessary and I actually did not miss them. But those recipes that did have photos included (center of book) were treated very well. The photos had a vintage\Amy Butler feel to them.Oh yeah – the author has a cat. That is ace in my book (Pun intended).I also totally loved the author’s use of the word “loverly” [mmmm, mmmm wouldn’t it be loverly…]The author, Isa, also offers a great feature on certain recipes: “ ingredient scavenger hunt”. Here she provide some important information regarding any lesser-known foodstuffs.One of the most important tidbits of information I picked up from this book was that lentils are nutritional rock stars! Rock on Wayne… Rock on lentil.I highly recommend this book for anybody who cooks or would like to learn how to cook. You don't have to be vegan. You don't have to be a vegetarian. You don't have to be a carnivore. I don't think cannibals would like this book though. Yes so maybe cannibals shouldn’t buy it. But anybody else who eats should buy this book. You can then come over and make my following favorite recipes for me:Quinoa PuttanescaCurried Chickpeas and GrainsEggplant Chickpea CurryLentil and Eggplant Chili MoleNote to Isa: I'm sorry I must pet the cat the instant I walk in the door. But I promise cooking the grains will come before kissing the husband :)",4,2
8070469,Appetite for Reduction 125 Fast and Filling LowFat Vegan Recipes,Gina,445,15,5,"July 7, 2011","After making six of the recipes, I think I can definitively say that this is the best cookbook in the universe. My zillions of other cookbooks are getting dusty and sad. Sorry, Deborah Madison. Red Thai Tofu: Delicious and easy! I will make this again. Butternut Coconut Rice: Amazing, and I don't love butternut squash. Chili-Lime Rubbed Tofu: Okay. I've never been a huge fan of lemon or lime on tufu. It seemed a little bland. Maybe I need a better chili powder. I don't think I would make this again. Smoky Split Pea Soup: I will never eat a pea--fresh, canned, or frozen. I hate, hate, hate them. But this soup is goooood. I'm going to put smoked paprika on everything from now on. ETA: I looked it up and it turns out that split peas and peas are totally different things. No wonder I liked this soup. Arabian Lentil & Rice Soup: Last time I made lentil soup it had a very dog-food aura about it. This one is about a million times better. The addition of rice gives it a little texture and I love it. Easy, too. It has cumin in it, which is the only spice I ever run out of before its expiration date. Cumin smells a bit like B.O. but it is so good. ETA: My first batch got eaten up so quickly that I made a double batch a few days later. That one was gone within 24 hours. This is good soup. It's also fast and easy, or at least it would be if I was faster at chopping onions. I can't seem to get the finger curl down. ETA: I have made this at least 5 times. It is a winner. Quinoa, White Bean, and Kale Stew: I like this a lot, but I'm not sure it would be my first choice when making soup. I used cannelini beans and I suspect chickpeas might taste better. It's good, though, and a great way to eat kale (which I don't like raw). Also, I now know how to clean and cut a leek (thanks lady on youtube!) ETA: I made this again with Great Northern beans this time and liked it much better. They are slightly more subtle than cannelinis. Baked Falafel: These just might be my favorite thing from the book so far, and that's saying a lot. I have made falafel before and it was a greasy mess and didn't really taste that great. These are fabulous and really easy. I made a double batch in the time it took me to fry up about 5 falafel last time (and they were from a mix!) It's also a really, really cheap recipe. I tossed a handful of dried garbanzos in the vitamix to make the chickpea flour (this is loud, but much cheaper than buying chickpea flour if you ignore the cost of the vitamix itself) and then mixed some sesame seeds, lemon zest, lemon juice, olive oil, water, garlic, and just a tiny bit of agave in the vitamix to make a tahini dressing (which was really more of a paste). Then we wrapped it all up in a whole wheat tortilla with spinach, cucumber, tomato, lemon juice, and hot sauce. And feta cheese, which is not vegan, but neither am I. Perfect, even if the tortilla was not authentic pita. Personally, I think pitas are way overrated. I'm never buying them again. ETA: I've made these at least 5 times--always a quadruple batch. Classic Black Bean and Veggie Chili: As written, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to be crazy about this one. It looked like it might be a little on the bland side, so I used this as more of a general guide, creating my own black bean chili. This cavalier attitude had already ended in disaster once this week (nastiest black bean quinoa salad ever), but it worked out this time and this soup is pretty tasty. Mods: added two large jalapenos with the green pepper, left out corn, put in a sweet potato (small dice), instead of chili powder I used dried chipotle flakes (not a 1-1 swap), doubled the broth, doubled the beans, and put in 2 T of smoked paprika to add smoke without heat. I would have liked to up the spice a bit, but some people around here are a little wimpy about that. Plus I'm a little wary after the great Chipotle Sweet Potato Enchilada debacle of 2010, where the enchiladas were so hot they were basically inedible and by the time you got through a few bites you were already ill and bloated from all the water you had to drink. So I just put some hot sauce in my bowl instead. I also tripled the garlic, but that's standard for me. When I see a recipe that calls for 2 cloves, I put in at least 6. Always. Generally my family is so glad they don't have to cook that they don't complain. I just realized that I left out the lime and agave, too, but I didn't miss them. Oh, and the cilantro. Not a big enough fan to intentionally add it to stuff. ETA: I've made this twice. Lettuce Wraps with Hoisin Mustard Tofu Tempeh Stir Fry: Mustard is one of those things I really miss about meat. I just don't come across a lot of vegetarian meals crying out for a big glob of yellow mustard. So I have been looking forward to trying out this recipe, although I can't really review the actual recipe, since I didn't use it, but the basics are the same. Sort of. I really wanted broccoli and didn't feel like pressing tofu, so I made a stir-fry with tempeh instead of tofu wraps and I didn't use the mirin. I found the sauce to be very, very sweet, so I added some soy sauce and seasoned rice vinegar. I like it, but probably not enough to make again. I'll just have to find some other use for my French's.

Every one was good, and the dressings were very creative. This is a vegan cookbook, but it's very compatible with WFPB eating as well, as the oil in this book is either left out or greatly reduced.

8070469,Appetite for Reduction 125 Fast and Filling LowFat Vegan Recipes,Laurie ,544,43,5,"February 14, 2011","I'm a definite Isa Chandra fan now (well, the Chickpea Cutlets from Veganomican had already won me over). I've been a vegetarian for almost 18 years and have lately taken to making about 40% - 50% of my meals vegan. I've never had such wonderful taste sensations and combinations as Isa Chandra makes. I really don't know how she comes up with so many delicious recipes. I really love her down-to-earth style of writing directions and all of the informative sidebars. It's like she's right there with you in the kitchen.Anyway, all of the recipes I've tried have indeed been ""fast & filling"" (and of course, low-fat) and quite easy. I encourage anyone to try some of these regardless of their diet. *Exception- chickpea haters need not apply.* :) Many recipes are also gluten & soy free, or can be made that way with the proper ingredients. Tons of recipes are under 30 minutes and others have plenty of ""downtime"", or hands-off time. The chapter subjects are salads, sides, veggies, beans, tofu & tempeh, pasta, soups, curries, chilis & stews, as well as some interesting quick little suggestions on bowls & sandwiches.I've yet to try one dish from every chapter, but I'm getting there. Here's the rundown of everything my hubby & I have tried & loved:~Everyday Chickpeak-Quinoa Salad 3*~Balsamic Vinaigrette 4*~Cauliflower Mashed Potatoes 4* for flavor, 5* for lightening up mashed potatoes~Silky Chickpea Gravy 4*~Chickpea Piccata 3*~Basic Baked Tempeh 4*~Creamy Mushroom Fettuccine 4*~Ceci-Roasted Red Pepper Soup 5*~Bistro Broccoli Chowder 4*~Caldo Verde with Crumbled Tempeh 5*~I also tried her Gravy Bowl suggestion for lunch 4*I've already mentally bookmarked many more to try very soon.

I love Vegan with a Vengeance and also Isa Does It! Here are my thoughts on recipes I've made.Godess Nicoise Salad - Fantastic! If it didn't take so long to make, this would be a regular repeat.Everyday Chickpea & Quinoa - Good. Would repeat but not anything to write home about.Pad Thai Salad- Was disappointed. The dressing was a very strong flavor and was easy to overdo.Caulipots-not bad. Would make it if I needed to use up cauliflower but prefer regular mashed potatoes.Refried beans -Loved this! Just didn't keep for very long. Best eaten day 1-2.Coriander mushrooms with cherry tomatoes - Loved this! Just didn't keep for very long. Best eaten day 1-2Mushroom and cannelini paprika's -too strong of a flavor and felt like it wasn't quite balanced.Black bean, olive and zucchini tacos- great! A lot more flavor without the corn tortilla. Will probably try again over rice so the flavor isn't muted.Apple miso tofu -disgusting! Maybe I just don't like large amounts of miso? Scallion potato pancakes- also found this disgusting. It seems like she might have trouble building flavor in certain recipes without fat. 2nd Avenue Vegetable Korma- loved with recipe with extra salt!

8070469,Appetite for Reduction 125 Fast and Filling LowFat Vegan Recipes,Lisa (Harmonybites),"1,834",324,5,"September 14, 2013","I'm partly rating this on faith, since I haven't had a chance to try many of the recipes yet. I was talking diets with a friend of mine who is a vegetarian (and note, never has had excess fat on her body in her life, sometimes I hate her. I told her I was once on the Scarsdale diet and described it to her--and her comment was that that sounded like the grimmest book on the planet--and recommended this if I wanted to cut fats from my diet. Mind you, my skinny friend uses recipes from this everyday. I, on the other hand, am very far away from the target group for this book. I'm not a vegetarian--and this isn't just vegetarian but Vegan. And this is very, very hippie. The introduction speaks much of things like ""cruelty free"" and animal rights and the environment. This isn't just a cookbook, nosiree, it's a cause! There's even a recipe for ""Caesar Chavez Dressing."" I kid you not. And that's not me. Although Moskovitz's sense of humor did mean I was more amused than irritated. This is the opening sentence of ""Chapter 1 - Full-On Salads:"" THERE WAS A TIME—A LONELY, LONELY TIME—WHEN SALADS were a pale and limp affair, relegated to the side of your plate, practically weeping. I think those dark days were also known as the ’80s. *snerk* I do appreciate the plethora of nutritional information. Each recipe tells you how many servings, how long it takes to make, and per serving the calories, calories from fat, total fat, trans fat, total carb, fiber, sugars, protein, cholesterol, sodium, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron. Also included are suggestions for what other recipes in the book would partner the dish well. I asked my friend some of her favorites--what I should try first. She told me the Buffalo Tempeh had become a standard with her, the mushroom tibs are delicious, the Garlicky Mushrooms and Kale a staple, the Onion Rings a treat, but the Chickpea Piccata is special. So that I decided to make first. The Grilled Portobello and Caulipots (Potatoes and Cauliflower mashed together with some broth and olive oil) were suggested as accompaniments. It was delicious! Portobello mushrooms, where have you been all my life! And the Picatta served over Arugula and the Caulipots? Nom! Nom! Nom! And this is a carnivore speaking. And btw, not someone I'd call an expert cook--but this was all easy to make.So, I'm rating this a five and calling it a hit. And I don't think I'm being premature.",1 like,2

It is perfect for the cook who is pressed for time, but isn't satisfied to exchange flavor for healthy eating. Isa Chandra Moskowitz spells out her approach to developing recipes in Veganomicon, a more comprehensive, instructive and sophisticated cousin of Appetite for Reduction. She explains that she loves strong flavors, relies heavily on her food processor, and likes easily obtainable ingredients. Check, check and check! Appetite for Reduction continues that approach with recipes using little to no oil and cane sugar. The fact that Ms. Moskowitz's fun, narrative instruction is chatty, breezy and occasionally a little bit irreverent is a bonus. Our home is what you might say ""uneven"" in its pursuit of plant-based, or even just healthy, eating, so I must mention how well these recipes pass my husband's skeptical scrutiny. Night after night, Ms. Moskowitz provides me with out of the ballpark hits. My husband's face is literally transformed by amazed shock at how good our latest vegan meal tastes. It happened with Big Fat Taco Salad, Cesar Salad with Eggplant Bacon, Sushi Roll Edamame Salad, and more. He couldn't get enough of Creamy Mushroom Fettuccine and would like me to make it regularly. Her recipes aren't just great ""for vegan food,"" as though the standard for flavor is lower. They're great, period. I highly recommend Appetite for Reduction, even if you aren't pursuing ""reduction"" or the elimination of animal products from your diet. ",1 like,N/A

I adore the things in it: OMG Oven-Baken Onion Rings, for instance. But I have an eBook edition, and I have to complain to the publishers on this one. It is many things I don't like about eCookbooks: page numbers do not relate to the eScript, the Index is not hyperlinked, no hyperlinked Table of Contents, references within the recipes should be hyperlinked...complain, complain, complain. Everyone knows that in the throes of cooking, one simply must have easy references or the references are for naught. Yes, it makes cookbooks more expensive to make as eBooks. Good reason why they should be priced higher, if need be. Anyway, I haven't lost any weight as a result of owning this book, but I can't blame Isa for that.
