452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Hirondelle,818,179,3,"May 7, 2012","I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand it is quite pretty, modern-looking, a simple introduction to these 3 cuisines and there quite a few recipes in here I mean to try. On the other hand, it is so much weaker than her The New Book of Middle Eastern Food! It´s like a summary of The New Book of Middle Eastern Food for Dummies (but with prettier styling and great photos. And not only that, but Ms Roden´s conversational style here can get a bit annoying if you are one of those people who reads cookbooks cover to cover (I do, I admit, if not too large and always with skimming when i feel like it. But I like to go over a cookbook cover to cover. That is how I get ideas, and techniques). There was this dinner with these people here, or this event here and that is repeated so very often - it´s not even really personal, it just seems so trivial, and not inducing to great trust that the writer is very familiar with the cuisine she is writing about, and I prefer to hear about history details or medieval tales in The New Book of Middle Eastern Food.",4,N/A

452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Heidi Polk Issa,80,2,3,"July 27, 2013","This book provides an excellent introduction to the world of Mediterranean/ME cuisine. Roden is extremely precise in the language she has chosen to explain each recipe, yet the details are never so pedantic that they take away from the taste and texture of each ingredient. She also includes bits and pieces of information about culinary history, traditions and practices in each area. The book contains several beautiful photographs of different dishes (my mouth watered more than once while trying to decide which recipe to attempt!)The book is divided into three parts – each dedicated to one of the title countries, and further divided into starter/appetizer, main course and dessert sections. Roden gives the traditional recipe, as well as useful information on regional varieties (thus the Lebanese knafe is equated with the Greek kataifi , etc.). Another bonus in the book – she readily suggests substitutions for particular ingredients that might be difficult to find outside of areas with a large influx of people of Med/ME descent (I found this particularly useful as I would otherwise have had to order some of these things online).All in all, a great cookbook by any measure, but especially for those who have an interest in Med/ME cuisine…",1 like,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Jerzy,467,104,4,"July 25, 2010","I've only checked it out from the library and didn't get to cook much from it, but the Chicken with Caramelized Baby Onions and Pears is delicious! The country introductions seemed pretty thorough and interesting as well.",1 like,2
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Horus,394,10,5,"April 20, 2022","This is a lovely cookbook with lots of great photos and some good details about the places the recipes come from. I appreciate that she offers more available alternatives for some of the ingredients, although, because she lives in the UK, sourcing some of the ingredients in North America might be less easy to find in some locations. The instructions are easy to follow and practical. ",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Liz C,616,1 follower,5,"October 29, 2021","Excellent. Claudia Roden introduced me to the range of Mediterranean food back in the 1980's when I was a student, with her excellent book, Mediterranean Food. This book includes the best Middle Eastern and North African recipes. Recommend to anybody who appreciates this type of cooking.",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Ashani,799,2,5,"September 2, 2021",I longed to read books by Claudia Roden. And this happen to be the first one. I love this !,N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Matthew Gatheringwater,156,1 follower,4,"March 19, 2009","I picked up this book at the library for the Lebanese recipes, but I had to renew it in order to try some of the Moroccan and Turkish dishes, too. Many of these recipes are simple and quickly made and there are lots of great salads and vegetable dishes. There are some hard-to-find specialty ingredients such as sumac or preserved lemon. Substitutions are suggested but I think it is worth locating the recommended ingredients. I've started using pomegranate molasses in so many (non-Lebanese) dishes that I wonder how I managed without it for so long.Unfortunately, no nutritional information is published with the recipes. Maybe that is why some dishes have more than two tablespoons of olive oil in a serving! Since I'm on a reduced calorie diet, I was pleased to find that most of the recipes I tried weren't spoiled by using half or even a quarter as much oil as recommended.There are many foods traditionally served cold, which means this is a good book in which to find recipes for packed lunches.",3 comments,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Hannah,17,2,4,"September 13, 2007","The food issue of the New Yorker had a profile of Claudia Roden, which led me to head to go out and get a library card. I was happy to discover that Arabesque wasn't checked out. So far, I've tried two things...a tomato spread from the Morocco section and baba ganoush, which I think was in the Lebanese section. Both turned out well. I will say that I have never seen a cookbook with so many recipes that use eggplants--I just wish I'd read this earlier in the summer when there were tons of them at the local farmer's market. I plan to keep trying recipes, although I suspect I'll mostly stick with the mezze (kinda like tapas) rather than the main courses.",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Jamie Felton,103,172,5,"January 11, 2008","What I've made so far:1. Saffron Chicken. Super easy and fast. I thought it would be difficult, but it turned out really well.2. Phyllo Dough Stuffed With Feta. Phyllo dough sucks. I really hate it, but if you can master it, these are really good and not too hard to make. The trick is that you have to work with the dough as little as possible while also working very quickly before the dough can start to crumble. ",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Lisa,111,29,2,"November 14, 2009","I browsed through this book last night when our date night ended with a trip to Barnes & Noble and although I was intrigued by the title and the cover, I wasn't thrilled or inspired by the recipes enough to want to continue reading it (opting to put it aside and pick up some bread books that looked great) or check it out from my local library. Oh well. Maybe another time this will be more appealing for me, but for now I will leave it on the shelf and go on to other cookbooks.",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Rachel,"2,811",53,3,"October 30, 2010","Claudia Roden has written another fascinating cookbook, which not only gives lovely recipes with titles listed in Arabic and English, but also tells a history of the food in each country and how it is traditionally prepared. Gorgeous photos and the print looks nice. I didn't bookmark that many recipes however simply because I have read many cookbooks on the topic, so most of them were nothing new. Recommended for food historians and those who like to cook delicious ethnic food. ",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Yasmeen,240,17,4,"March 22, 2012","I wish this had more pictures that would communicate how awesome these dishes are. I was blessed to know what each recipe looks like! Overall, it's a REALLY good cookbook with authentic recipes. I know that it is probably directed to westerns and not middle easterns, but there is no real difference between that and a local cookbook. I actually love accurate universal measurements, so I prefer this one.Can't wait to attempt Lahma Bel Ajeen and most of the salads. :D",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,"Lady Claire, Marchioness of Fancy Pants",455,17,3,"June 30, 2008","I enjoyed that this cookbook had recipes from three different Middle Eastern regions. It gave you a broad range of recipes to chose from. I am a beginner to Middle Eastern cooking, and I would have liked to see more photos of the finished dishes. One thing I did enjoy about the recipes in this cookbook is that they use similar ingredients in many of the recipes.",N/A,N/A
452254,Arabesque A Taste of Morocco Turkey and Lebanon,Firefly,20,3,5,"July 7, 2011","I agree with earlier posters who love the hardcover edition. The copy I have is even more beautifilly designed than the one pictured here on GR. It inspires one to get in the kitchen and get tactile and messy. I have tried a few recipes, and have many more bookmarked ... and I'm a veggie too! Really nice book ",N/A,N/A
