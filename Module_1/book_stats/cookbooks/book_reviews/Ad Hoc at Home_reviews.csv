6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Amy,4,6,2,"December 26, 2009","I know that one of Thomas Keller's goals when opening his restaurant Ad Hoc was to serve the best versions of simple family food: the best fried chicken, the best prime rib. These recipes may in fact represent the best of their kind, but I will never know, because I have zero interest in cooking anything in this book. We cook a lot in my house -- I'm married to a professionally-trained chef, and we cook dinner from scratch almost every night -- but we don't have the time or energy to cook Keller's recipes on a regular basis. Though these recipes may seem simple (roast chicken, vegetable soup), you will soon realize that Keller is asking you to cook each vegetable in a dish separately so each will be cooked to perfection. One recipe calls for 3 or 4 different kinds of squash, each of which must be cooked separately, before they are combined with farro and black rice, which must be cooked separately. This commitment to perfection is why Keller's restaurants are good, and it would be expected from his French Laundry cookbook. But this book is billed as ""recipes that you can make any or every day."" And for the most part, that is completely misleading.Listen, I get the importance of technique. I know that the way you roast a chicken can be the difference between a mediocre chicken dinner and a transcendent, crispy-skinned beauty, and I will say that this book can teach someone a lot about the best ways to do certain things. I am also not a stranger to spending time on food -- I've made jam and cider and pickles and cheese. But if I'm going to follow a fussy recipe -- for a special occasion or a weekend project -- I want the result to be something extraordinary. For this reason, Keller's French Laundry cookbook makes more sense, because the grandness of the food justifies the intensity of the cooking experience. Ad Hoc at Home is too much work to be simple, and too simple to be worth the work. If I want the best fried chicken, I'll fly out to Napa and let Keller's chefs do the work for me. I'm sure it will be just perfect.",13,1 comment
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Ted Fristrom,23,3,4,"July 9, 2010","Now that I've actually worked with the book a little, I can only recommended it with qualifications. It is more down to earth than other Thomas Keller books, but that also just makes it seem like there is less of Thomas Keller in it. Many of the main recipes are staple fare--roast chicken, roast pork, etc. and the only mark that might make them Keller-like is the obsessiveness with which things are cooked slowly and in separate pans. The instructions are really detailed in all the wrong places. It'll tell you how to cut a Kobacha squash into 5/8"" dice, but it won't tell you how to peel it. In fact, if you follow the instructions literally, you're supposed to peel it before you even make the first incision, a task which I imagine would leave many people with sorely nicked knuckles. In some ways, the details that are there may even make it easier to screw up. Especially since he likes cooking many things on the lowest cooking temperature possible. So even if you get your squash into uniform 5/8"" dice, a little difference in your stove top is going to still lead to greatly varied cooking times. I didn't mind so much, since I know when it's supposed to be ready, but still, in many cases I had to wait a good 50% longer than expected.In the end, I trust his recipes as I have in the past for things like roast chicken. They're simple on ingredients, and long on process--and that's generally a good thing. But it's mostly the same process recommended in about a dozen other cookbooks under the title of ""high roast,"" and the one in Judy Rogers's The Zuni Cafe is better described and, well, just better. That said however, the book shines in the side dishes, condiments, and the cheese primer. After you're done making your traditional, yet unremarkable roast, you can serve it with a rice and squash dish that includes farro, black rice, kobacha, delicata, and butternut. This will take twice as long as your main course to prepare, and take twice as many dishes. When he tells you to cut every squash in a different way, and to use a different roasting pan for each squash, you'll probably here the voice of SNL's The Anal Retentive Chef. But that's just him. That's Thomas Keller. And if you bought the book expecting anything different, you shouldn't have bought it all.  ",5,N/A

Chief Keller really cares about preparing good food his way. Nothing very practical for me about most of his receipts but who cares? I appreciate the passing on of his considerable knowledge and expertise. Can't help myself - this is a delicious read.",4,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Gina,"1,720",55,2,"July 27, 2015","I know it's not the end of the month yet, but honestly, I decided more than a week ago I wasn't going to attempt to make anything else out of this cookbook. I might try again sometime in the future when I'm retired or have a robot to help me. Until then, I just don't have the time.This is a beautiful cookbook. It is coffee table book size with beautiful photography. There is some fun and interesting stuff to read about Keller, his restaurants, his kitchen tool recommendations, and cooking techniques. I hope one day I'll be privileged enough to try his food in one of his restaurants. I have to question his connection to the world outside of his kitchen, however, when he declares that these recipes are for everyday cooking. Don't be fooled as you flip through and see many 5 ingredient recipes. There's a good chance 3 of those ingredients are the result of other separate recipes you would need to make first before making the final product. It took me 3 days just to make the beef stroganoff recipe - following the instructions for resting time, cooling time, and then final preparation. It was delicious, but ain't nobody got time for that. Other recipes call for each element, such as each vegetable, to be cooked separately before being added to the primary dish for additional cooking. At some point I'm going to run out of skillets. This is a beautiful gift for foodies, but lacks all practicality for regular, weeknight meals. ",3,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Amanda,347,34,5,"October 20, 2020","Beautiful book, excellent technique and lots of very useful instructions with photos on basic but necessary cooking skills, like cutting up a chicken properly for frying. He is also dead on about being prepared for cooking in the intro to the book (read the beginning of the book!): Measure out all your ingredients and have them lined up on the counter before you even start with your recipe, and i can tell you as a cook who tends to be ADD in the kitchen, this will save you from starting a recipe and realizing halfway through that you're missing a key ingredient or don't have enough of one, like eggs or something, so now it's all for naught. However, Keller somehow manages to turn even the simplest recipes into something overly complicated. I understand the need for perfection, that's why he's one of the greatest chefs working today and his restaurants are critically acclaimed. But this is pushing it as a cookbook for the home chef. I do enjoy a lot of the recipes, especially the preserving section, and his technique for cooking prime rib was fascinating and I'm eager to try it. I will probably buy this book for my home library for it's reference qualities, but I don't see myself making every recipe.If you want a truly amazing famous-chef-whose-recipes-are-amazing book to cook from that you will ACTUALLY cook from, then get a copy of Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles cookbook. I've yet to find a book that is so incredibly straightforward, accessible and useful with instructions like the Les Halles book is.",2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Wendy Darling,"1,519",33800,4,"May 8, 2011","I'm a big fan of Thomas Keller's. I've only eaten at his restaurants and been in his bakeries a few times, but each visit has been an exceptionally good experience, from the quality of the food to the courteous affability of the staff. (Fun story: I once saw a man on the subway in New York eating from a $42 jar of his foie gras. He did not share.) I like his matter-of-fact food philosophy and style, which in Ad Hoc just takes classic comfort food and does it really, really well. I consider myself sort of an advanced beginner of a cook but I am an ACCOMPLISHED EATER, so I enjoy finding chefs who can not only make great food, but can also demystify the process for the home kitchen.This book is gorgeous, filled with fantastic recipes and drool-worthy photographs--and it's worth buying for the recipe for lemon-brined fried chicken alone. Many of the recipes do take some time and preparation, but I expected as much from a chef like this. The book is also a little big and unwieldy for comfortable storage, but I still find myself hugging it from time to time for the inspiration and enjoyment it provides. There, you know the book is good when the only complaint is its size.",2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Suzanne,104,14,3,"January 21, 2013","This book is a lovely, well laid out instruction manual. Keller is a stickler for quality ingredients and methodical prep work, and it's fun to read what he does in his kitchen. However, I gave this 3 stars because I do not have five hours to prepare dinner. I also do not have a team of assistants to help me clean up the twenty five pans it's going to take to cook everything the Keller way. I don't even own twenty five pans. On top of all of that, I live in an area where some of the ingredients he lists are not going to be readily available. And this book is BIG. It's like a coffee table book more than a cookbook. It's more than a little awkward in the kithen, imo. I like to prop my Ipad on its stand, or do the same with my notebook or a cookbook I'm using. That's not possible with this behemoth.Great cookbook if you have the time and inclination. I'll continue to enjoy looking at this cookbook, but will probably use my other old standbys for actual cooking.",2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Ehrrin,186,31,5,"February 16, 2010","I've long lusted after a meal at one of Thomas Keller's restaurants, and it remains one of my dining goals in life. This is the first time I've read one of his cook books, but I'd heard that this one was especially geared to the home cook. It is amazing. At first I was put off by the gargantuan size, but then was thankful for every page and every inch. It's lovely, instructional, inspirational. I checked this out of the library, but ordered a copy for keeps while still poring over my library edition. Someday French Laundry/Per Se/Ad Hoc/Bouchon, you will be mine.",2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Amy,514,33,3,"December 18, 2015","Gorgeous, mouth-watering book. If I had the time to cook this way, I have no doubt my food would taste remarkable. But I focus a bit more on speed and health than perfect flavor and I don't think I'll be turning to this book too often. Others have given more detailed reviews on the length and detail of recipes (separate cooking, many pans, lots of perfection). For me, it's just not something I'll be able to do regularly, although a meal from here for a special occasion would definitely be spectacular.",2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Timm Higgins,37,10,5,"December 16, 2011","As a chef myself, there's one standard to go by and that is Thomas Keller. With this one, while not all that simple he does come down from the things seen in either the Bouchon or French Laundry Cook Book. While I don't usually cook directly out of them, I use them for inspiration when looking to put new items on my menu's. They're a fantastic read, and a wealth of information for even the home cook.",2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Kelly,307,33,4,"January 22, 2011",I didn't expect this book to cover half of my body length. And I certainly did not forsee any guffawing on my end. I feel as if I can make anything with my im-ag-ination...[image error]Perhaps I still have a bit of conquering to do. ,2,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Mandie Lowe,374,35,5,"February 15, 2015","*Update - 15 February 2015*This recipe book has become my everything. It is the first resource I consult when I am faced with a new ingredient, or when I want to know to which temperature to cook lamb, or when I want to try something new that I know will taste like restaurant food. Tonight I made the herb-crusted rack of lamb and it was perfect in every way. I followed the instructions, I set my timer and out came an absolutely perfect dish. It wasn't difficult, or complicated. Certainly, it required a garlic preparation, a honey-mustard glaze, the herb crust as well as the scored and seared racks of lamb, but none of those individual components take a lot of time to make, nor are they complicated.This is my favourite recipe book (and my collection is EXTENSIVE) and I would recommend it to anyone who gleans any enjoyment whatsoever from recipe books.______________________________________This book is too much.Way, way, way too much.I mean, I love recipes. Food, cooking it, eating it, creating things in the kitchen. It's a hobby. I like to read about it and look at photos of it and collect books about it. I pay for updated recipe software (Living Cookbook), scan all my recipe magazines in to save as PDF, take photographs of food or whenever I spot a recipe somewhere and keep a handwritten journal filled with my most comforting recipes. I subscribe to and read cooking blogs daily. Yet my passion pales in comparison to what it must have taken to compile this recipe book.In Ad Hoc at Home Thomas Keller took a simple concept - good home cooking as served by a restaurant - and pushed it as far as it could go. This book is massive. As I was reading through it, I became tired. It's pretty to look at, the recipes sound lovely, but at one point (about halfway through) I realised I wasn't up to the task. Usually I like to read recipe books or magazines in one sitting, paging through the recipes and deciding what to make first. With Ad Hoc I had to give up at the recipe for Scallion Potato Cakes (p230). I needed a break. It was just too much information. Surely there couldn't be that much information in one recipe book?Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. There is value for money here. This is a book worth owning. It just doesn't make for good leisurely reading. It's too much for a brain to handle in one large dose.Five stars, because what more could you ask for? This is it. This is THE recipe book. Buy it, own it, stroke it lovingly, but whatever you do, don't try to read it in one sitting. Mere mortals are simply not up to that task.As for the type of recipes it contains, that's easy. Everything. It's all in here. Yes, even grilled cheese sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies. Along with wine-steeped golden raisins, brined pork tenderloin, buttermilk fried chicken and parsley water. Have you ever seen such a combination of recipes together in a book before? It's insane! It's crazy and I love it. Get it. Treasure it. Bake some cookies.",1 like,N/A

Chicken and dumplings - 2.6 stars - we aren’t dans of broths soups so this could easily be loved by others. The dumplings are amazingly good.

6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,Katie,198,3,4,"September 19, 2011","This is a hefty book that I could see comfortably perched on counters all over the United States. Each copy would have a broken spine and splotched with drips and drabs of food. It would be thumbed through when a bit of inspiration was needed. Ad Hoc at Home is chock full of great tips and recipes and there really isn’t anything NOT to like about this book. It’s a great way to learn some basic (but upscale) recipes to try out in your kitchen. Don’t expect dainty restaurant dishes or anything terribly fussy. I think that you of course need to start with a foundation of knowledge in cooking before you can move on to increasing complexity. Ad Hoc provides an entire book of recipes to help you start to develop yourself as a skilled home cook. I also liked the little tips sprinkled throughout the book – they are actually very helpful (I find in many cookbooks those little “tips” end up just being filler). Overall this is a successful cookbook. I wish that it was a little lighter in weight – I think it may weigh 7 pounds, but I don’t really count that as a criticism. **** = glad I read it, I enjoyed it, I would read it again.",1 like,N/A
6391443,Ad Hoc at Home,J,326,44,4,"December 1, 2013","From the foodie perspective, this book is a treat, and owing to its size, it makes for great coffee table perusal. I purchased Ad Hock at Home in a boxed set a couple of years ago at a B&N after Christmas sale. It was 50% off. Ad Hock at Home is fun to go through, but a few of the recipes are something I might think about but never really make. That said, Thomas Keller is an artist, and because of that, his recipes can be a little intimidating. Whenever I look this book over, it serves as a source of inspiration, and it never fails to do the trick. I am amazed at how people like Keller can come up with so many creative ways of entertaining the palate. Keller also is a good writer and his stories are very touching. As my cooking skills go up, I find myself seeing the book in whole new ways with the passage of time. It is a book I am growing with.This book is a keeper, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates Thomas Keller's artistry.",1 like,N/A
