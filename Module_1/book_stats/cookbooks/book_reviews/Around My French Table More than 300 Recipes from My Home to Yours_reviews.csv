When I think of French cooking, I always think complex, time consuming and hard to find ingredients. Dorie Greenspan dispels that conception with ""Around My French Table...""The book is filled with wonderful recipes that even the most timid cook wouldn't be afraid to try. ",9,2
7847439,Around My French Table More than 300 Recipes from My Home to Yours,Stacy,456,25,4,"December 14, 2014","I finally understand why half the foodie world is going nuts over Dorie Greenspan in general, and this cookbook in particular. Named Cookbook of the Year by the IACP this month, Around My French Table is a must-have, a magical combination of tempting photographs, approachable yet sophisticated recipes, and superb writing. Each recipe is accompanied by a delightful anecdote behind how she acquired it and tips on how to prepare it best. For example, her ‚ÄúTop Secret Chocolate Mousse‚Äù recipe relates her quest to get the recipe for this delicious mousse she was served by multiple friends in France. It was so good, but no one would tell her how to make it. Finally, a close friend revealed what no one else wanted to: The recipe was found on the back of a bar of Nestle baking chocolate. It‚Äôs stories like this that make us feel like Dorie is a good friend teaching us to cook while sharing wonderful stories of the people and places in France we ourselves would like to visit. Some recipes are traditional, but without the fussy Julia Child approach; like modern French cooks, Dorie doesn‚Äôt mind taking shortcuts where possible, and she also includes ethnic-inspired recipes from former French colonized countries like Morocco and Vietnam.I loved the book so much, it was my pick for my first cookbook club event (where everyone brings one dish from the same cookbook). I want to make everything in here at least once, and I‚Äôm already off to a running start.",7,N/A

7847439,Around My French Table More than 300 Recipes from My Home to Yours,Stephen Simpson,636,9,4,"November 3, 2018","This is a surprisingly tough book for me to review/evaluate. If I didn't already have a lot of French cookbooks, I'd probably like this more and that's really not the fault of this book/author, right? I'd say a lot of the classics/must-haves are here, but there are definitely some big omissions, and she has altered some of them in ways that purists will probably complain about. Likewise, I can see French food snobs sniffing about the inclusion of non-traditional (""not real French"") foods, ingredients, and recipes. I was a little put off by her inconsistent use of names (sometimes she uses classical French names for dishes, and other times not), and I'm not sure I'd like how every recipe turns out. On the other hand, she gives good ideas/hints for adjustments and substitutions. In the process of writing this out, I actually talked myself into moving this from 3-stars to 4-stars, so I'd say this is a solid book to have in a collection, but I can't say it would/will ever be my preferred go-to French cookbook, and I do still think there are many better French cookbooks out there.

Do you love Julia Child? French food? Simple recipes? This is your new bible. Gorgeous to look at and so fun to read--I have a new interest in en papillote cooking-Yes, French cooking can be very healthy! Haven't tried everything in it (yet), but I think I will. Martha and Dorie doesn't have quite the same ring to it as Julie and Julia, but I don't care. I'm in love.",2,6

I loved the occasional descriptions of her shopping adventures in France and wished there were more of them.Since it is a cookbook, and a hefty one, I didn't force myself to read every word. But I did turn every page, read all of the comments in the margins, and skim each recipe to see if I could or couldn't live without cooking it, immediately. There were only two such recipes--her Beef Daube looks like a sensible replacement for the over-complicated Beouff Borgiononne (plus, I never have been able to spell it). And a baked cauliflower dish looks so scrumptious I'm probably going to try it for Thanksgiving. One invaluable tip I found was how to make my own Creme Fraiche. Next time I need the finicky stuff, I'll think two days ahead and make a batch with the leftover heavy cream in the refrigerator and the plain yogurt I buy for the dogs.",1 like,N/A
7847439,Around My French Table More than 300 Recipes from My Home to Yours,Cynthia,633,43,5,"September 13, 2010","There are recipes here for every skill level. The instructions are clear with lots of back story in many cases where Greenspan discusses who's recipe it is, why a certain ingredient is included and how it impacts the dish, some in depth vignettes on how to work with a certain food and how to choose your ingredient. She also includes serving and storing tips with all recipes. Best of all are the mouth watering pictures of many of the dishes. I also have Child's ""The Way to Cook"" which I like but with Greenspan you feel you're having a chat with a friend in your own kitchen. ",1 like,1 comment

7847439,Around My French Table More than 300 Recipes from My Home to Yours,David,262,4,3,"February 18, 2022","Not a bad book, but too much name dropping, and not every recipe needs a dreamy anecdote to introduce it. The recipes themselves are fairly traditional with a modern twist, but do tend towards the overly complicated chefy style that plague too many ""home"" cookbooks, and there is WAY too much cream involved. Other quibbles: The bread recipe ingredient amounts are volumetric only and lack weights (that's irresponsible, not quaint), and the recipe steps aren't numbered, making it harder to follow. The whole thing is also quite wordy.To illustrate, here's a slightly exaggerated recipe for rice in the style of the book:Although rice isn't particularly French, the Parisiens of course have their own take on it, as typified by the 5th Arrondisment bistro ""Chez Chat"", where chef Jean-Louis Frederik LaBoiue features ""Riz √† L'Ancienne"" on the menu. Parboil 1 cup of hand-harvested heirloom rice for 30 seconds, one grain at a time. Blot dry each grain, then split in half lengthwise to remove the germ.Lightly saut√© the rice in 6 tablespoons of unsalted Normandy butter for 45 minutes until golden brown. Deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup Cognac. Make a bouquet garni of chervil, marjoram, fennel, dill, and tarragon. Steep in 6 cups of extra-virgin olive oil for 3 hours.Thinly slice a shallot, soak in ice water for five minutes, then drain, dry, and mix with 1/3 cup of Dijon mustard, 3/4 teaspoon red wine vinegar, and whisk in the seasoned oil. Season to taste with salt, preferably fleur de sel.Gently mix the vinaigrette into the rice, add 3 cups of fresh dill, and swirl in 2 cups of heavy cream. Garnish with 1 cup cr√®me fra√Æche and sprinkle with piment d‚ÄôEspeletteServing: Pairs well with Salle Pleyel Beef Cheek Daube, Roasted Jerusalem Artichoke Tagine √† la Boulud, and Chantarelles Proven√ßalBonne Id√©e: top with freshly grated black truffle, or strips of candied orange zest if truffles aren't in season.

7847439,Around My French Table More than 300 Recipes from My Home to Yours,Wintergal,13,1 follower,3,"January 25, 2022","My rating is reflected in the amount of recipes that interested me enough to copy them and prepare to make them. For a large number of recipes I found interesting, the oven was needed, so often I rejected these as too expensive to make. I can‚Äôt justify using an oven to prepare potato pancakes, it‚Äôs just not an economically viable solution. When I‚Äôll be using an oven, I‚Äôll make some parchment or foil parcels the author suggests, there were combinations I haven‚Äôt tried that sounded promising (bok choy with more traditional greens done not in a typical Asian way, pumpkin and brussel sprouts as an example). There‚Äôs an interesting take on glazed carrots, several pilavs and marinated salmon in a jar, and selery root puree recipe out of the savoury part. Apple tart from different kinds of apples - that‚Äôs a really interesting idea!, and coconut cakes out of all things sweet. So though it‚Äôs not a bad book by all means, I could use it just a bit. Interesting to read the stories even if I wasn‚Äôt interested in the recipes to them. I‚Äôm glad to have gotten an option to not buy the book but borrow it from my library as an ebook. With some cookery ebooks, I want to have a paper version after all (very few of these get to be in my library as actual books and be read and used and loved), more often it‚Äôs easier to just check them out in library, read in Libby and take away couple of recipes. I‚Äôm still grateful to the author for the work done, even if I don‚Äôt love her final product.",N/A,N/A
