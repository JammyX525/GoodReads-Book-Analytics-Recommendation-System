17415999,Against All Grain Delectable Paleo Recipes to Eat Well  Feel Great,Sherry,586,59,4,"August 10, 2013","Let me begin by clarifying that I am not now nor ever will be a proponent of the Paleo diet. In my opinion it is a diet that rather defies logic but as someone who has experienced extreme discomfort from the foods commonly found in most diets I can completely understand and sympathize with the need to do something that will bring relief. I have had to rid my diet of all gluten, dairy, sugar and processed foods which brings me to why I enjoyed this cookbook despite the fact that I bought it as a e-book and I'm not so crazy about the format (not the books fault and at a savings of $30 something I'm happy to live with)The book offers many recipes for foods that I've had to do without because they've either had gluten, dairy or sugar in them and it's refreshing to find a recipe book where I don't have to omit or modify (too much) recipes due too my sensitivities. She's got some good recipes for basic foods that have had to be avoided due to the fact that they're too high in sugar or are processed. Her recipes for ketchup and barbecue sauce look good and don't even get me started on her recipe for caramel sauce (ooh-la-la!)which are all free of sugar and processed ingredients.Each recipe has a photo which I appreciate as I find that's an important part of picking what I want to cook (seriously, the photo of the caramel sauce is drool-worthy!)I'm also looking forward to trying her recipe for the nut cheese. All in all, a very good book and recommended to those who are looking for alternative ways to eating that support ridding your diet of sugar and processed foods. ",11,N/A

For those of you looking to move to a more wholesome and healthy lifestyle, this is a great cookbook to help you on your way. I must tell you that I do not eat wheat, gluten, corn, sugar or processed foods as they cause me many issues including weight gain, chronic sinus infections, constant colds, anxiety, depression, chronic fatigue, joint pain, among other things. I do eat some grains, but not often as my husband has gout issues that require him to eliminate all grains from his diet, which happens to be the original reason I picked up this book.I have tried smoked salmon eggs benedict, celeriac and sausage hash, and the lemon vanilla bean macaroons. All are delicious and will be made again. I am planning to make the blueberry waffles, Korean beef noodles bowl, granny sarella's spaghetti sauce and the world famous sandwich bread in the next couple weeks. The waffles and bread are particularly exciting to me as there are no bad reviews of these recipes on her site and they are very non-traditional being made with nut butter base.The author of this book was very ill and getting no help from standard medicine. She made her way to a Naturopath, as I did, and was able to get her life back on track by identifying foods that did not agree with her through and elimination diet, which I highly recommend. You can read more of her story here: Danielle Walker's health transformation. You will not be disappointed in this cookbook.",4,3
17415999,Against All Grain Delectable Paleo Recipes to Eat Well  Feel Great,Janey,188,4,5,"March 21, 2021","Venturing into a Paleo diet, this happened to be my first cookbook. I enjoy having an actual book to thumb through so I don't always have to hop online and search the blogs. I'm also learning that different Paleo books/blogs vary on what ingredients they use and/or what they allow. I'm focusing on sugar-free, grain-free, and dairy-free more than just ""caveman"" or ""hunter/gatherer"", then I hope to add back in raw and grass-fed dairy. One week in and we feel great--more energy, clarity, weight loss, and clearer skin--but we have buyers remorse with the dang cost of all the different high quality ingredients and products. We're hoping it's just the initial upfront cost with collecting all the ingredients to have on-hand.Anywho, loved this book. We've tried the Paleo waffles, graham crackers, sweet potato fries, and cauliflower rice. All were delicious; especially the waffles! Also, loved Danielle's story of why she HAS to eat this way. Her story, and the many others, is why I believe these kinds of lifestyle diet changes can cause a drastic improvement on one's health, whether it's just improving health or actually preventing disease. I believe a sugar-, grain-, and conventional dairy-free diet, while adding in quality vegetables, grass-fed pastured-raised meats and eggs, and raw or full-fat grass-fed dairy can relieve symptoms from some diseases and can free one of some medications.

17415999,Against All Grain Delectable Paleo Recipes to Eat Well  Feel Great,Alexis Asbe,1,3,5,"July 31, 2013","A true love story recipe for all of us.... Simple small town girl changes the world with her testimony. Danielle Walker shows up being exactly who she is; one of US! A real girl; self taught cook and photographer, wife, mother, daughter and girlfriend who finds herself in the midst of a painful disease and through her biggest struggle delivers healing and hope for many. Inspirational in an unassuming, humble, grass roots kind of way, I find the simplicity and clear almost basic nature of the recipes so refreshing. I love that she sorts out what to use and how to use them as if you are standing next to her and the mixing bowl. She is a pioneer in showing us that our story can have meaning and with the right recipe we can change the world. We just need to go AGAINST ALL GRAIN! I am going to order one for everyone on my Christmas list; it is the great gift of delicious food, love and health all wrapped into one! LOVE THIS BOOK!",2,N/A

Don't eat it period if you're on this diet you don't need to be making excuses and fake cakes. Eat real paleo meals not pretend muffins.",2,1 comment

I like reading about Danielle's story about her autoimmune issues and healing herself through food. I'm less likely to embrace a food lifestyle if it's the ""latest thing."" I'm looking forward to working my way through this cookbook. ",1 like,N/A

17415999,Against All Grain Delectable Paleo Recipes to Eat Well  Feel Great,Amanda Taddey,213,5,4,"November 20, 2017","I’m starting to experiment with a much more “clean” diet, less processed and eliminating some common triggers. Danielle breaks down Paleo specifically in this cookbook. I especially enjoyed the extras in this book explaining some common ingredients she uses that are a little off the beaten path for those who haven’t cooked this way before. I’ve made quite a few of the recipes in this book and so far have not had one I didn’t enjoy. The blueberry waffles are so good and comparable to gluten-made waffles. Many of the main course entrees are easy to understand and delicious. I made the chocolate chip cookies today and they turned out great! I’m not following a 100% grain free diet, but really amenjoying trying out some new ingredients and recipes. The one piece that poses a challenge is obtaining some of the ingredients she uses in these recipes. I still haven’t found a few or they are much more expensive than I’m willing to spend at this point. I did have some on hand before I got this book so the burden of a whole new shopping list was avoided slightly for me. ",1 like,N/A

The recipes are based on Walker's personal version of the Specific Carbohydrate Diet, and so many of them are still suitable for that diet, and the whole book is grain and dairy free, as well as free of refined sugars. The table of contents for each chapter tells you if a recipe is nut free, egg free, vegan, or fit for SCD.Walker uses palm oil shortening as well as coconut oil in her baking. Measurements are in U.S. Volume. There's no storage advice, and the index is arranged by type of thing with a little thumbnail of the picture next to it, and then there's another index by ingredient that's just a huge list of page numbers.Probably an excellent paleo cookbook! But not for me.",1 like,N/A

IFF your kid has diarrhea etc. 1st, no dairy is no casein protien. Includes modified milk solids. Remove instantly changes in 48hrs. Gluten takes 3 mths and must be weaned out. It is not a cure, it removes the IBS, daily nightmare , night terror , the stoned... where they trip all the time and never put their hands out. Normal tummies . ... nada. Returning to these foods they must be weaned back in . ... tiny bit at a time.There are some recipes I want to on try, like homemade almond milk... see the severe one still doesn't drink regular milk. He went on a dairy free diet at 6 mths. Does nothing and no reaction when he has cheese.",1 like,N/A

That being said, I would never make very many of the recipes because they are a little too complicated for my liking. Lots of ingredients (though mostly lots of spices) and just too complex for something I would actually make every day. However, this WOULD be a great cookbook for someone that is cooking for a family and/or someone that loves to cook and doesn't mind a bit of a challenge. Very thought out cookbook and very descriptive. ",1 like,N/A
