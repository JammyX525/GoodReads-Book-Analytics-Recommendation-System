2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Betsy,100,12,4,"December 19, 2010","CAVEAT: This book is potentially triggering for survivors of physical, emotional, and/or sexual abuse, as well as animal lovers.I heard Augusten Burroughs said, and I paraphrase, that Running with Scissors was a joyous romp compared with this book. Now that I have read it, I understand why. Running with Scissors does seem like a collection of insouciant anecdotes juxtaposed with the raw, unpolished emotionality that Burroughs unfurls in this narrative. I've read doubts from others about what in this book happened and what was less than 100% factual...whether or not every event in this book occurred is really a small detail. To me, Burroughs here exposes the terror, the powerlessness, the confusion of being the victim of an abuser against whom one can not have agency, can not escape, can not rationalize. People wonder why victims stay in bad situations, and this book expresses that slow, upheaving descent into abuse vividly--the complexity, the confusion, the instability that keeps the victim/s scrambling and unsure.There are some moments of inconsistency in the voice that Burroughs uses in his retelling (shifts in persona from child to words that seem more likely to come from an adult) and some lapses in time that elicit frustration. But, this is part of what makes this precisely a re-telling, a re-living, a re-memberance. Burroughs is, as one would, piecing this back together. The seamed echos make it that much more realistic, that much more like the re-claiming and re-telling of other abused people's stories that I have heard, more like my own voice, too.If you try to be the enforcer, the lawyer, the law when you read this, you might be disappointed or frustrated. But if you come to it as the listener, the empath, the psychologist, you can learn from his story.",80,6
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Lyn,"1,845",16300,3,"June 24, 2019","Sad, pitiful, disturbing but ultimately redemptive.Augusten Burroughs’, born Christopher Robison, 2008 autobiographical work A Wolf at the Table describes his difficult childhood with this parents and his older brother. To say that the Robison’s were dysfunctional is like saying Neil Peart of Rush is a drummer. The action in this novel takes place when Augusten in younger and mostly precedes the action in his 2002 novel Running with Scissors.Mostly about the caustic and troubled relationship between Augusten and his creepy, Dionysian father, this is also about how this poisonous upbringing effected him later in life. A ubiquitous theme in Burroughs’ narrative is that he does not want to be like his father who is somewhat mindful of the dad in Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values, though there is nothing charming about Father Robison as opposed to the roguish abstractly disconnected charisma of Phaedrus.There is much mention of his brother, John Elder Robison, who is the author of Look Me in the Eye: My Life with Asperger's. Knowing that John’s unusual behavior could be explained by his Asperger’s Syndrome created an oddly gratifying sense of theatrical irony while reading.A fitting illustration of the book was the scene where Augusten’s father gave him a baseball glove – no ball – and then the son-of-a-bitch wouldn’t even go outside with his son. Of course, what would be the point without a ball to throw and catch?This reads, though as a memoir (really a war story) as also a cautionary tale, especially in our modern day come-as-you-are society. I was raised by my step-father, a damn fine man then and now, as good a father as they come, and I have raised three wonderful sons. As an attorney I have represented moms and dads in divorce and custody proceedings and more than a few child support actions. I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. I have seen fathers who were genuine and true, flawed as are we all, but dedicated and loving and providing an example of what to be and too frequently, but humbly, what not to be. And … God help us all, I have seen the sperm donors who, but for morals and laws, are breathing too much good air. (the term worthless sack of s*** comes to mind).Burroughs does not give us a Field of Dreams happy ending, but he does get through a tortuous there and back again modern day fable of neglect, abuse, self-loathing and deliverance.",51,9
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,tee,239,244,2,"July 30, 2014","Burroughs is dramatic. He's a ranting, raving, immensely creative drama queen. Unfortunately his drama queen antics were too overboard this time around with way too many ""could have"" ""maybe he..."" ""i think he could have""s. Sandwich this with his writing being an awkward combination of sufficiently good and cringeworthy and you have a headache on your hands. The bright! he stared at the bright! when he was a year and a half old. Gah, save me.It goes without saying that I think abuse of children in any form is horrid; that includes anything Burroughs' father may have done; whether it was making him feel unwanted or scaring him. He sounded like a bitter, twisted, nasty old man - the way he supposedly treated animals shows that. For a child, the daddy that doesn't pay you attention and simmers with rage in his rocking chair can indeed be frightening. He is that wolf at the table. I guess in a way a desperate part of me just hoped that by the time you hit forty, you're hopefully starting to mend and ceasing to chase daddy's affection. When you read a memoir like this and see that this shit can still hurt so many years later, it's daunting. I say this at 31 years old with pocketfuls of unhealed bitterness of my own. Damage that I want to be mending but can't seem to. Perhaps Burroughs writing this book was cathartic and part of his healing process. If that's the case, I hope it helped.I guess it's just frustrating as a reader to see this guy putting himself back in the range of fire over and over again. Reading it as fiction, you'd want to slap him, really. Dude, you found an abandoned cabin in the fucking woods - go hang out there, why would you be so intent on wanting to curl up in daddy's lap? From your descriptions of dearest daddy it probably smelt like cheese anyway. Or rather, in true Burroughs spirit, if you'd cuddled daddy his crotch would have snapped you up with it's burning teeth of fire whilst wailing banshee screeches, lashing octopus limbs, fire, doom, death. You know, maybe, but daddy just sat in his chair drinking himself to oblivion in a vain attempt to deal with his shitty life and scribbled notes about the price of corn instead. Reading this book as the memoir it is intended to be, however, it's just sad. I was that kid seeking my mum's affection and attention. I kept going back for more. If I had been reading my story, I would've wanted to tell me to just quit it too.Part of me wanted to tell him to get over it. And himself. I think that had a lot more to do with the dramatic tone rather than his trauma. I mean, if you're going to be a dramatic jerk - at least make it worth my while. It's what I had expected. Instead, it was a patchwork of rather isolated incidents with a young Burrough's furtive imagination fuelling the drama. He wasn't physically abused, thankfully, and I well understand that emotional abuse can be ten times worse but it seemed that much of the abuse was implied. A look from daddy, could be three pages of what Burroughs thought the look meant. The dog that became daddy's dark sidekick after several days of young Burroughs' absence - had been magically turned by the dark overlord. Burroughs envisioned the dog having been tortured by electricity, poked with sharp implements ... and so on. The dog was a little nuts; it was likely it was hardly ever fed considering how neurotic and self-obsessed the entire family is. No wonder it was acting out.The thing that I noticed, was that he nagged his dad a lot and subsequently got ignored. Over and over. His bedroom door was no protection for his dad's fist; which was never used against anyone but was implied (over and over). And sure, a violent parent can be terrifying, a father punching a wall nerve-wracking but why not just write that, rather than imply things that apparently didn't happen? Every time he called his father 'dead' instead of 'dad', I cringed. He googled for missing students near where his father lived. I mean, come on, if that isn't a bloody overactive imagination then what is?! This book is less about his father's neurosis' and a lot more about his own.On a side note, if this isn't a fine case for why divorce is a must for some people then I don't know what is. Why would these two have even stuck together?! (Yet again, I say this having similar examples in my own life). Daddy was a boring, old, bitter man and his hatred and dissatisfaction with his life made him ill and sore and pained. When little kids come along and get in the way of one's misery and navel gazing, they got told to go away. I mean, who wants to bounce a curly-headed little angel up and down on one's arthritic, swollen knee. But then what child wants to be petted by smelly, flaking hands anyway? Maybe Daddy didn't want to subject such a bouncing, bubbly, charming little tyke, such as Burroughs to a mouthful of blackening stumps. The odour of death. Dark wings of Satan flapping all around that gingivitis cavern of gloom. And death. Which kills.I'm sorry Augusten, I don't know where my love affair with you took a nose dive. I'm pretty sure this book had something to do with it. I'm a little worried that if I re-read your other books, they'll only irritate the shit out of me. WAS I ON CRACK OR SOMETHING WHEN I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE AWESOME?! Or is it more to do with the fact that you are nothing without that humour for which I so loved you in the beginning. I hope your next ten, fifteen, fifty memoirs are at least hilarious.",47,18
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Melissa,99,9,1,"April 15, 2008","I had to stop reading this because I was so infuriated by the first chapter. I'm sorry, but there is NO WAY Augusten Burroughs remembers looking at the mobile above his bed when he was not even a year old (and in such detail!), or what the bottle tasted like at that age (or being sad when it was taken out of his mouth!), or that he was thinking the moment his friend got lost at the seaside (""I just assumed he'd never return""... what toddler thinks like that?). After ""Running With Scissors,"" I'm sure he has some dramatic argument for why memoirs shouldn't be a literal reading of the truth - or why ""the truth"" doesn't exist in a subjective world - or some bullshit, but I'm not buying it.",27,12
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Will Van,22,9,4,"July 7, 2008","Augusten Burroughs is one of my favorite contemporary authors, and it has always puzzled me a bit regarding the debate as to whether or not the events in ""Running With Scissors,"" and now ""A Wolf at the Table,"" are ultimately word for word truth. Given the corroboration from his older brother who has written his own memoir, I would have to say that there is a good chance that much of what Burroughs writes is based on his actual experiences. I suppose if I were a character mentioned by him and felt that I had been terribly slighted, It would be far more important to me (hence the lawsuit), but what do the best writers do? The embellish. They exaggerate. They often lie. Capote would say the same were he still with us.A Wolf at the Table is considerably darker than Burrough's most well-known work, describing his perspective of a father who was quite possibly a sociopath. The darkness in him begins to unfold slowly, through alcoholism, emotional neglect and manipulation, and this character study gives light to some of the developments in ""Running With Scissors."" A cynic might ask such questions as: do we really need another book about a traumatic childhood and a distant and emotionally abusive father? Shouldn't Burroughs just ""grow up and get over it already?"" Why should we care?The reason I do care comes down to his writing skill. He is simply brilliant at what he does. The often gorgeous prose, the depth of character development, and the emotional impetus that he conveys puts him in this category in my opinion. So much so, that I could care less if he actually remembers sitting in his high-chair at age two, staring through the holes in a saltine cracker. It doesn't have to be true to be great writing.

2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Jan Kendrick,11,4,3,"July 30, 2008","Wow.This is a tough one... A tough review to write, a tough book to read.Normally I like Burroughs' books, but I am truly torn over this one. Things I liked: The description, the imagery. I truly FELT (not just UNDERSTOOD) what he was writing. I also liked the way the book flowed. It was chronological for the most part, which made sense, but it wasn't rigid. It wasn't a day-by-day diary of his life. That would've been too much. Finally, I liked the threads he wove throughout the book: his father's health (knee, skin), the drinking, the animals, his fear of being/looking like him, the idea of loneliness... (There are more, but I don't want to risk spoiling anything..) Finally, I liked the ending. It was well-paced and appropriate.Things I didn't like: The beginning was hard to get into. He begins the book when he is less than a year old and talks about that time as if he has actual memories of it. It was hard to believe, which made it hard to read. I don't usually care about that kind of thing, but somehow it bothered me here. He just went on and on about life and huge thoughts he had at such a young age... Again, usually I am happy to extend grace on the details for the sake of telling a good story, but it was all just too much. Also, the voice in the book was awkward. In the beginning, he tried to use a childlike voice to reflect the age he was writing about, but it just didn't work for me. I found it more distracting and awkward than authentic. Finally, the subject matter was simply tough to stomach at times. That's not entirely Burroughs' fault, of course. It happened; he was just telling the story. But at times it felt more dramatic than it needed to be to get the point across. Some things felt more like punishment to the reader than necessary detail.All in all it's a well-written book that's simply tough to read at times. But I'm glad I did.",21,N/A
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Christine,44,1 follower,5,"August 2, 2008","Some of the ""Average Joe"" negative reviews of A Wolf at the Table that I've read online complain that author Augusten Burroughs' ""didn't really know what it was like to be abused"" or that Burroughs' mental anguish in the hands of his father's quasi-psychotic unpredictability ""was boring, same day in day out"" or that ""it wasn't funny."" Wow. What a bunch of self-centered, whiny turds.A Wolf at The Table is what it is - a simple memoir of a son who spends a lifetime searching for the love of his father (who happens to be detached, cunning, and mentally ill). Yet, it is powerfully written and evocative. Burroughs' growth and maturity as a writer, the ease at which his writing breathes from the page is most evident in A Wolf at the Table. It compelled me from the start. In fact, I contend that might be the best Burroughs' work to date.",18,3
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Paul,42,10,5,"May 2, 2008","I like Augusten. In this post-Frey Scandal world, it seems anyone who writes memoir has suddenly become suspect and frankly, I resent it. No one ever screamed FRAUD at Truman Capote for fictionalizing his past – well, at least not to his face, I’d imagine. Anyway, much has been made of the fact that the quirky humor that has kind of defined his style thus far is missing from this book (and make no mistake: it is) but then the subject at hand, viz., his alcoholic and possibly psychotic father, doesn’t really lend it self to odd character studies and witty observations – though, to be fair, I did have a good laugh at the odd turn of phrase here and there. The most exciting thing about this book is that Augusten’s prose has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years. He has said in interviews that he is now turning back to Fiction – sometimes people forget that his first novel,Sellevision,was Fiction – and I can’t wait to see the results. In sum: if you like Augusten you will love this book; however, If you think he is a fraudulent memoirist, then keep scanning the shelves.",17,4
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Sandra,770,98,4,"February 26, 2018",Very sad. It breaks my heart to think how many kids might be living in a hell like this right at this moment.,12,N/A
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,malic,38,17,5,"June 1, 2008","this book is terrifying. it's about a little boy who longs for love from his father, who in return psychologically terrorizes him.  This is Burroughs' third full-length memoir, and it takes place mostly before the time Running With Scissors was written about, with a couple of stories that take place in his adulthood. However, I think I would still recommend reading his books in order of when he wrote them. A Wolf starts with a melodramatic tone, and then Burroughs jumps into his memories of being a baby. While these memories set the tone of his family life and contrast with the lack of memories he has of his father as a very young child, I didn't quite believe them. His descriptions use too many adjectives that only an adult would understand. However, this part of the book lasts only a short while, and then it gets really good. Burroughs is a genius at writing from the perspective of a himself as a little boy, with insight from the analysis of an adult. He writes candidly about the physical and emotional abuse from his father, as well as his own love, fear, and anger towards his dad and his never-ending need for approval from him.  Burroughs also writes about growing up as a gender non-conforming boy. While Burroughs never directly never blames his dad's homophobia on their relationship, I could not help but wonder how much it impacted their dynamics. Probably, though, homophobia its self is too simple. Towards the end of the book, Burroughs writes that the time he lived with his mother's psychologist (Running with Scissors) was the most informative part of his life. I don't believe this at all. I think these first thirteen years of Burroughs'life living with his parents was, which is probably why he could only write this book after the four others. also, i listened to the audio book which Burroughs narrates and it's so incredible to listen to him tell his own stories.",10,N/A
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Luke,534,34,4,"December 29, 2008","If you've read and enjoyed Burroughs' 'Running With Scissors' then there's really no excuse for not reading 'A Wolf at the Table' - purely because it provides the other half of the story.Let me clarify. While Burroughs' earlier memoir revealed what a uniquely torturous childhood he'd had, it also presented it in a very John Irving kind of way - horrible, yet camp and darkly fabulous. There were, amongst the freaky parenting and bizarre psychotherapy (wankroom, anyone?) moments of happiness there, and it served to lighten the edge of the work.That's not the case in this memoir. It speaks pretty much exclusively of Burroughs' father - a figure who's not really mentioned at all in the earlier work. And from what's contained here, it seems that mentioning him at all is something that's required a lot of time to pass - the man is truly monstrous to his son, who merely wants to be loved.This is a strong, brave book. Burroughs' style is a little uneven, and I found my attention occasionally wandering - but his prose is much tighter this time around, and some of the horror of the family unit will quickly bring your attention back to the page.This is a deeply, deeply sad book to read, but it's worthwhile. It's amazing Burroughs survived at all, let alone lived to write something as confronting as this.",10,N/A
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,BAM the enigma,"1,765",352,4,"February 7, 2017","This is the third Burroughs memoir I have read. I honestly have no idea how he survived and became successful. The only word I have to describe his childhood would probably offend half of my followers, but it was seriously f$&@ed up. Unbelievable I'd have a drinking problem too. I think we all look back and think,"" man that was totally dysfunctional"" about aspects of our younger years, but Burroughs takes the cake. ",9,N/A
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Antoine,7,4,4,"August 6, 2013",Beautiful and painfully written. Augusten Burroughs tells a dark and twisted recollection of his childhood... As he experienced it. This book is for anyone who ever longed for the acceptance of a parent. Moved me to tears.,9,N/A
2145681,A Wolf at the Table,Kristen,239,12,4,"August 13, 2008","I read Running With Scissors and was alternately horrified and fascinated with the author's life. I read Scissors with a weird detachment, viewing it instead as a fictional memoir, because it was too difficult to read, imagining that what he described actually happened to him. But, I did enjoy his writing style, the wit, and his sense of humor. I wouldn't describe his books as ""funny"" but there is a certain dark biting humor to them.I started out reading this book, already mentally prepared, having read Scissors not too long ago. It turns out, this book is a bit different of a style. I still detached the little boy in the book from the author, because the story is just so sad. The relationship between father and son filled me with longing and fear, two things Augusten himself seemed very familiar with. He has a very unique way of writing that really puts you in the moment with him. And several times, as I read, and he described his fear of his father coming to get him, I felt my own heart race, as if I was afraid his father would come get ME because I was reading his son's book. The parts about the animals really bothered me. They link cruelty to animals to serial killers and Augusten often thought as a father as a serial killer, so I thought that was interesting. Augusten's father was definitely a menace to the family. I was especially sad when he turned Brutus against his wife and son. All in all, a good read. The story was engrossing. Some people wrote bad reviews based on the fact that his early memories were ""made up"" but all stories are embellished, even memoirs. I thought those memories really added to the story and the book would have lacked something without them. They helped to add setting and make his dad seem more HUMAN, like he was once normal and wasn't anymore. ",8,N/A
