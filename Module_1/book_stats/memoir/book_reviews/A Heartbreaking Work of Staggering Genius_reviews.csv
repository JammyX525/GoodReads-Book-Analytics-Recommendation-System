4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Tara,205,266,1,"March 20, 2017","**Note: This review was written almost 10 years ago. I would gladly delete it, but it appears some people have engaged in fruitful back-and-forth in the comment thread. I let it stand for the sake of their discussion, but since every once in a while I wake up to an email informing me of how some stranger on the internet thinks I'm an asshole (and as I'm also a person who can't stand the heat and would gladly get out of the kitchen if I could), I'd like to add a few disclaimers.This review was written by a young woman who never dreamed more than 2 or 3 people would read it. Hence, I was not attempting to be Northrop Frye. I was being silly. I entirely agree the review would be better if it attempted real, concrete criticism rather than aggressive shrugging. To write that review, though, I would have to really care about AHWOSG, and I simply do not. But that does not mean Eggers deserved mere snark. I leave it up only to a) allow people to continue their discussion and b) the mere recollection of it is a source of instantaneous humility.Finally, this review was the product of an incarnate, imperfect person with background associations and moods trickling into their work. I had a chip on my shoulder when I wrote this. You could say I was sneering at someone(s) in the review besides Eggers (of course, sneering is bad and one shouldn't do it at all, whether on the internet or face-to-face). As I wrote above, a good and meaningful review would be far more impartial, specific, and clear. But this isn't a good and meaningful review. It's a hasty sneer with perhaps some basis for its attitude but certainly not in the review as written, and the author would gladly delete it save for the fact that it hosts a comment thread other people find productive.So enjoy discussing AHWOSG on this thread, but if you are awaiting a response from me on the merits of the book or to further explode in fireworks of snark, I'm afraid you'll be waiting in vain. The thread stays; please, be polite to one another. Even if snark has some ground in the truth, it only encourages snark in others, and no one feels good or changes their mind when they feel attacked.** One of my least favorite books of all time. I cringed with frustration as I turned every page, and I only wanted to finish it so that I could say I found nothing redeeming. Oh sure, he was flashy and could draw a cheap laugh, but it was like admiration for bubbles: it went nowhere and said nothing. Henry James this is not (I don't love HJ, but I know talent when I see it and this is self-examination for voyeuristic purposes). I was disgusted with the title when I first heard of it; though I can see the attempt at self-ridicule, eh, nope, he's pretty satisfied with himself. I then heard so much lovely stuff about it, which worries me now in retrospect, but I tried it with an open mind: Nope Buddy!Why even go into the hundred reasons why it sucks, since the author is such a vapid creature full of style and lacking substance - the book doesn't really merit an intellectual attack. Really, I think it's every single thing that is wrong with certain aspects of modern literature. Foster Wallace and Eggers can suck my metaphorical dick, since they seem to exist for nothing else but their own pretension. Way to reveal modern angst boys, sorry that people a lot smarter did it better a hundred years ago, and said something relevant for people who weren't self-absorbed fops. I look forward to a future world cataclysm in which this book can be lost, and something worthwhile take its place in the literary canon. (Also, I apologize to all the people who really sincerely love this book. I know I like some things that can be deemed pretty trivial. And who knows, maybe the author is a nice enough guy. I just, I gotta say it, I really can't stand this book, and wish there were better books around to take away some of its appeal. Art for the ego just doesn't seem enough).My memories of the book have grown hazy, and I did write my first review while living in New Orleans. I think I slammed down a drink at Igors at 3 am while waving Flannery or Walker or Eudora in the air and swore that Franzen and Eggers were my metaphysical enemies and one day I would read Wittgenstein deeply enough to make seemingly-profound arguments about nonsense culture-consumers like ""Stop making literature a habit of stylistic consumption and read something and decide if it's true."" I remain too lazy, but still, I think we should read literature with an idea of the Good, and how to pursue it. My always-reforming vision has been consistent about thinking of this not as a charming memoir but as a lazy memoir without real love or value. I wish I could see what so many think they do, but it remains mirror-playing to me.. Maybe most of this is late-night fighting-Tara b.s., but I still think my absurd perspective is still more concerned about what is good and lovely and true than the steady narcissism of AHWOSG.",446,83
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Polly,1,35,5,"September 12, 2008","look. it's cool to hate on dave eggers. it's *so cool* to be post-dave-eggers, and talk about how you didn't really like this book all that much, and it's even cooler to totally hate this book. it's like a coolness interview question. ""did you like his book?"" ""yeah, I really did."" ""well, we can't be friends with *you*...""this is just like those hipsters who don't like justin timberlake. fuck you, hipsters. that new album is solid gold.I loved this book. I loved it, and I still love it. I wish to god I had sent away for the optional large-scale flow chart. at one point in my life, I had several (*several*) copies of this book, and I gave them away and lent them out and now I have none. one of those copies was practically destroyed with the underlining and highlighting and dog-earing-of-pages I practiced on it. I wish to god I still had that one.and listen, cool kids. deep in the uncool heart of you, you loved it too. so step off.",380,31
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Clare,46,26,2,"August 7, 2007","I disliked so very much about this book. The grating self-awareness, the oh-I'm-so-clever stream of consciousness asides, the indescribably tedious discussion of his magazine work. But the heart of the book, the story of Eggers and his young brother trying to be each other's whole family after the death of their parents, is genuinely sad and funny all at once, a difficult feat to accomplish. I wish he'd stuck to telling that story instead of trying so hard to make me think he's a staggering genius. This book made me realize how much I resent authors playing around with style before they've proved to me that they can just tell a sory in an effective way. I just want to say, ""You're not too smart for traditional prose if, say, Jane Austen isn't. If you have something to say, say it. Impress me with your grasp of language, not your ability to posture."" ",151,7
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,William2,728,2816,4,"June 7, 2020","A very fine book, but tied closely with its period, so a bit dated. I suppose the publisher will be footnoting it before too long. I’m going to have to read that really long, really serious Péter Nádas’ novel afterward, for AHWOSG is far too hysterical. Excessive hysteria pushed past all reasonable thresholds of human tolerance into the realm of whistling past the graveyard. I think it’s the twentysomething prospect of near-continuous coitus that’s to blame, making the text at times almost a giddy stream of consciousness. Yes, sex, and the subsequent sadness that visits all animals (see Galen), is effervescently behind the unrelenting half-grimacing hysteria here, the flopsweaty feigned cool. Everyone is a walking talking cut of meat, under constant appraisal, marked up or down accordingly. Every waking moment, my God, the pressure to be hot... (But this is subtext, mostly.)Then our narrator and his friend are fucking on a public beach at night. Some Hispanic kids come up. The lovers are virtually naked. The passersby are needlessly cruel as only youngsters can be. It’s as if they can’t turn away from this spectacle of sex. It holds them in thrall. They know they should move away but they don’t. Then our narrator makes things worse by threatening to call the cops. He can’t find his wallet, which belonged his late father. (N.B. The kids don’t have it.) He doesn’t hesitate to tell them of the disadvantage they will be at when the police arrive. It’s ugly, but riveting. (Akin to what happened recently in Central Park, New York, when a hysterical white woman turned on a proud African-American bird watcher.)Then the narrator blames his friend, John, who tries to commit what is admittedly a ridiculous attempt at suicide. His empathy fails. Eggers seems on a pace here to outdo Will Self’s not infrequently humiliating cruelty. Like Self, Eggers will go to almost any length to outrage the reader in the name of entertainment. And Eggers knows this, so then he pulls the cruelty in for a post-modernist query every now and then, in which his shame is poked and prodded as a means of self absolution. He upbraids himself, too. He really doesn’t let himself off the hook easily. Everything, you might say, no matter the cost, is bought and paid for.The narrator’s guilty and brilliant digressions, when he’s taken a little time out for himself, must be ⅓ of the book. When for instance he leaves Tōpf with a new sitter and goes out seeking sex. His imaginings of what might happen to Tōph in his absence are grotesque and wild. It’s touching because he’s 22, beginning his sexually active life, and divided between that travail and what remains of his family. The nonsense associated with his fly-by-night magazine, Might, is hilarious; especially the Adam Rich faux obit whose ramifications neither the undead nor the editors were prepared to handle. Then there’s Tōph who, with the narrator’s canny last-second maneuvering, gets a handshake from Bill Clinton outside Chez Panisse. The narrator passing a kidney stone. Have you ever seen one of those things? They look like jacks or perhaps a barb cut from barbed wire. Poor man. But the frisbee playing–there I drew the line; 35 pages on frisbee tricks; I think not. Anyway, the prose flies faultlessly along. Even the parts that are too long, like the MTV interview, which is a wonderful critique of the show’s clichés, but at 54 pages egregiously long. This is Generation X’s On the Road, but with name brands and well known movies and historical events peppered throughout. Reading it 17 years after publication it feels like a kind of period novel, not unlike Saul Bellow’s Humboldt’s Gift, but without the big picture view of geopolitical and celebrity shenanigans. That’s high praise.What strikes me most is Eggers’s recognition of his subject matter. That was very shrewd indeed. To know he had this story before him. The parental deaths are horrible, no question, and the pressure on the author to be a kind of pre-parent at age 22 to his brother Tōph is unfair. Fortunately, he and his brother were blessed by an enormously rich social network. That’s a gift. In that sense I envy them. That, if anything, was their saving grace.",99,16
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Matt,19,76,2,"January 15, 2008","as a huge douglas coupland fan, i thought i might enjoy 'a heartbreaking work...' i should've known better. i tried to read 'you shall know our velocity' last year and found it entirely unreadable. i gave up after 200 pages of nonsense. several friends raved about 'ahwoasg,' so i thought, 'ok, i'll give eggars another try.' again, i was horribly disappointed. the pros: yes, it's funny at times and very *honest* (though can we take eggars at his word? never trust an autobiography). i laughed out loud several times while reading. many of eggars observations are insightful and funny. and yes, we do feel badly for dave and toph (at least in the beginning) and the the sibs after they lose their parents and head west. the 'here's a drawing of a stapler' was a good one, but the novel is short on humor and long on 'look at me and feel badly for me and my poor little brother.' in the end i just didn't care, nor did i have any reason TO care. narcissists don't necessarily make compelling protagonists. the cons: 500 pages of psychobabble, 'witticisms,' and 'biting obseravtions' don't necessarily make one a 'talented writer,' as so many have stated. get an editor, for crying out loud. the prose isn't anything write home about -- it's sloppy and unfocused (and what's the dropping the 'f-bomb' 20 times per page? get a thesaurus while you're at it). read eggars and then read steinbeck, eugenides, or ishiguro and you'll see the masters at work. this novel is so completely self-indulgent and bloated that i kept looking for a needle under my bed to pop the darn thing. eggars tries WAY too hard to show how 'clever' he is (by using his oh-so-ironic hipster slang), but he's not as clever as he wants to believe (unless he's playing us all -- if that's case, i would applaud him). in short, it has it's funny moments, but so did my grandma's funeral. i'm just glad i bought it used.",91,13
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Charlotte May,670,1025,2,"October 12, 2017","Well, this was an uphill struggle. Such dense writing, about nothing important - paragraphs and paragraphs of random crap, like throwing a frisbee, or whether or not he will sleep with a girl and then being unsure what actually occurred afterwards. I’m baffled that Eggers managed to drag this out for just under 500 pages. There is no feeling, I didn’t connect with any of the characters, they were so two-dimensional. Just a timeline of his life bringing up his brother after his parents died. Moving from house to house, the paperwork he forgets, the difficulty of juggling his social life with the raising of a dependent. But the writing was just so tedious, so bulky, I didn’t like it, skimmed a lot and just generally felt like I’d wasted my time. I liked the premise, just not the execution. ",89,16
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Amanda,2,11,4,"September 7, 2007","Clearly, this is a polarizing book. All I'll add is that the first time I read it, sometime in the middle of college, I had all of the negative reactions I've read here. It was sometimes funny, and sad and beautiful and all that, but mostly it was an autobiography by an asshole who was full of himself and I just didn't see why I should care, why I should keep reading. And then I read it again a few years later. And I don't really know what happened in between exactly. Maybe I became friends with more assholes. Maybe I became more of an asshole myself. But I really loved it the second time. By the end, I was feeling the kind of exhilaration and momentum that I've only gotten from a handful of books ever. The other interesting thing is, I had this exact same series of reactions with Catcher in the Rye. Granted, I read that way too early. Like, 8th or 9th grade. But still, same reaction. So, maybe give it another try in a few years if you're so inclined. Also, I'm kind of okay with Dave Eggers being a bit of an egotistical asshole. Honestly, I think that he delivers enough that I don't really care what kind of guy he is. Yeah, the McSweeney's empire has probably been overhyped, and I won't go into that here, but I don't think that most of the attention he's gotten has been unjustified. At the very least, I think that he's trying to get more people to read and write. I'm not sure how successful he's been, but the goal is noble and rare and I approve.",68,4
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Jeff,49,66,4,"August 27, 2007","Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave. What can I say? I can sort of remember picking up this book in a bookstore somewhere and reading the first few pages… now, not the first few pages of the story, but I’m talking about the copyright page. Freaking Dave Eggers is writing his novel starting with the copyright page? Wild man, wild man! So, I read it. I liked it. It was this nonstop stream of consciousness kind of thing, which I found a bit comforting, cause that’s how I think. I mean, of course that’s how I think, cause my mind will just sometimes ramble on and on and on about nothing in particular. It could be about donuts that my mind is thinking about, it could be about women. Maybe it’s about basketball. I miss Michael Jordan. 1992 was the year they first made the Dream Team for the U.S. Basketball Olympic team. Do you remember all 12 members? I do. Swear to God I’m not looking this up: Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, John Stockton, Karl Malone, Charles Barkley, David Robinson, Clyde Drexler, Chris Mullins, Patrick Ewing, and the one college player Duke’s very own Christian Lattner (I don’t know how to spell his name… okay, I looked it up- it’s Laettner) And really what ever happened to that guy? How did he get on the dream team? One shot? He hit the winning shot in an NCAA basketball tournament. That’s it. That’s all he ever did. Shaq O’neill was waiting in the wings. Hell Isaiah Thomas could have been that last player, but apparently Michael Jordan didn’t want Isaiah on the team. Who knows if that rumor is true? Certainly not me. Anyway, a friend of mine read the book and she didn’t like it so much. Which almost made me question how I felt about the book, but then I thought, “No, stay with your belief system man! Don’t let someone else’s opinion sway you.” But that did get me to thinking if there were books that men preferred over women, and vice versa. I don’t mean sexist misogynistic type books, but I’m talking the writing style specifically. Is there a cadence to writing that men prefer? Is there a cadence that women prefer? Maybe someone should write a thesis about that. I know it’s not going to be me. I didn’t major in psychology, though looking back I wish I would have because there were so many cute girls in the psychology department. In conclusion, I enjoyed this book.",64,4
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Kelly,447,216,1,"May 22, 2009","Before I picked up this book I had heard endless tales of how wonderfully smart and funny this book was, how terrific the writing was and how the originality would slap me in the face like a cool wind on a summer's day. They were wrong. I hated this book like The Cure hates happiness. I understand writer's have their own style, and that is what, in and of itself, separates them from all the others. But, seriously, we learn paragraph breaks for a reason. It gives the mind's eye a break, a breather. Eggers, a rebel in his own mind, discards such mannerisms. Aside from that debilitating hindrance, the book is THE example for egotism gone awry. Now, before you start, yes, I am aware that a memoir book is, essentially, an ego stroke. But the good writers, they have the ability to make you forget that it's merely self-indulgence, sweep you up in their lives...in their story. Rather than want to beg the author in so many ways as to warrant that 500 feet order to invite you over, Eggers is the kind of guy you would actually go out of your way to avoid.  ",58,10
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Diane,"1,079",2605,2,"August 17, 2014","This book has not aged well.I read it when it first came out, somewhere around 2000, and I remember loving its high-energy sentences and how Eggers shared his emotions about losing both his parents to cancer and taking guardianship of his youngest brother, Toph (short for Christopher). I was in my 20s back then, and I could relate to the author's angst about life, his career, his relationships, blah blah blah.Fourteen years later, I picked it up again as a book club assignment. My reaction this time was almost the total opposite: I hated the author and how narcissistic he was, I thought his writing was pretentious and too clever by half, and the book was SO LONG and tedious that it needed a better editor. I'm talking about someone who would slash and burn more than 200 pages from this sucker. This person should have the guts to tell Eggers, “Dude, not every word you think needs to be written down. Maybe you should self-censor.” Some parts I would cut are the longwinded preface and acknowledgments (DO NOT READ! It is a waste of time and paper!), and also the unnecessary addendum to the paperback, called ""Mistakes We Knew We Were Making."" All of that junk is Eggers trying to be funny about his writing process and his wild and crazy group of friends in San Francisco, but it just comes across as annoying. (And when you get to his interview for MTV’s Real World, skip ahead 20 pages. It’s just him spewing nonsense.)What was interesting about rereading this book (now that I am older and slightly wiser) was noticing how much Eggers imitated David Foster Wallace's writing. It's a meandering and detail-driven style that one either loves or hates, so if you are a fan of DFW’s fiction, you might like this book more than I did. ",54,16
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Tom Quinn,531,135,3,"December 10, 2021","Heartbreaking? Check.Staggering? At times.Genius? Debatable.3 stars. I liked it a lot more on a second reading, years after the first, as a man now older and—dare I say?—wiser (a little bit, at least). As books go, it's not, like, phenomenal literature or anything but it is entertaining in a few spots and emotive in a few more. Eggers has a distinct voice, a heavy hyperbolic Gen X self-aware and self-absorbed style, very much a love-it-or-leave-it deal:We walk the halls and the playground, and we are taller, we radiate. We are orphans. As orphans, we are celebrities...We are the bright new stars born of a screaming black hole, the nascent suns burst from the darkness, from the grasping void of space that folds and swallows—a darkness that would devour anyone not as strong as we. We are oddities, sideshows, talk show subjects. We capture everyone's attention. (96)In between fits of insufferable-seeming self-adulation (one hopes it's exaggerated for effect!) and neurotic self-loathing, Eggers raises a few questions pertinent to his time: what is the nature of fame? What is the proper aim of youth? What from our past is worth keeping and what can, or even must, be jettisoned? And if everybody faces personal tragedy, does that make my own any more or less significant?",48,N/A
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Eric C,17,1 follower,1,"August 8, 2007","I was sick of Eggers'self-absorbed schtick after three pages of the preface. But, the cover read""pulitzer prize finalist"" (among other superlatives), so I forged on. I'd madeit to page 33 of the actual text (without laughing once) when I noticed Eggers'picture on the back cover. He reminded me of some people I'd met when I wasworking at a startup company during the early internet boom. They were so fullof themselves with their free-wheeling style, their stock options, and theirflat-front banana-republic slacks. I felt they were full of shit, but it tookme awhile to act on that feeling with confidence, and, thus, to stay in school. Historyultimately proved me right. Therefore, I decided to learn from that history,and I threw this book in the trash.",47,4
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Matt Quann,605,374,4,"March 16, 2018","For the first half of this Dave Eggers book--which everyone has been telling me to read since the dawn of time-- I was absolutely in love with Eggers' writing. Eggers' unique voice coupled with his heartbreaking, raw, and personal familial tragedy made for a story that was both poignant and interesting to read. I really enjoyed his asides, and found myself smiling when a conversation between Eggers and his younger brother evolved into a metatextual examination of Eggers' entire venture.But then I got to the long form interview and the wheels sort of fell off the back-half of the story.What worked as cute, funny, or poignant in the first half turns into some sort of artistic ouroboros in which Eggers rarely grounds the story enough for the more experimental tricks he's trying to pull off. Naturally, Eggers prefaces this shift during the aforementioned interview. There's some parts of the second half of the book that I really enjoyed, but it definitely lacks the quality of the opening half.It's a shame because I was so impressed with the first half and so lukewarm by the book's end. No doubt that the book is readable despite its experimental trappings: I read through it in sessions that were long, but I seldom felt as if I were putting in work. I'm glad that I finally got around to this one, thanks to everyone for pushing me to read it!",43,2
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Fabian,933,1525,3,"December 12, 2018","About a boy who loses both parents & must then become a parent to his own sibling... Sure, many elements must converge to make a wee autobiography one outstanding read. Here's the jist: Eggers is an almost-household name writer who abuses his witty (ha-ha-ha) title and confounds the reader with an (incredibly dragged-out) insistence upon his own life story. Bookmarked by the dual tragedy of losing parents to cancer (within weeks of one another) are a bunch of vanilla events making up the bulk of the narrative: the guy knows just how vanilla it all is, and by using the tragedy as a platform to exalt HIMSELF (!) he can comfortably become the new superliterary Tyra Banks. Obviously by starting with the incident and by ending with it, the tugging at the heartstrings is seen as mechanical, a (if not THE) gimmick. It IS heartbreaking, though. Almost enough to (just like with my experience with 'Animal's People"") put it down for good, if not for the attempt to make this into an even MORE personal account, promising much, even having revised editions put out, with new additions, clarifications notes, etc. Oh, Eggers: We truly care about you (why else read 400+ pages of your life?)!!! Post-modernism is promised throughout, as if this novel device will leave the reader awe-struck, as if the work shall surely be ""staggering""! The only development here is the author's promises of a ""straightforward"" first half and a whimsical, self-absorbed postmodern second half. It's all a LIE (!!!) There is so much anger in this that it negatively affects the plot itself (how he is completely obsessed by his blond haired-blue eyed sibling, how he thinks bad things will happen any time, how he wants to fight the status quo he has no real problems with...). Once one discovers that at an editor's request to paint a ""deeply hilarious"" portrait of tragedy (I will bow down only to this: the Writer's Balls... his deep courage to prostitute away such an intimate detail in order to sell books [a method which, by the way, actually worked!]), to make it wacky and somewhat self-aware (only in that dreary, lazy way of the Postmodern work labeling itself as such), all the magic, all realism (which, in all truth, is what's incredibly HEARTBREAKING) is gone.",41,1 comment
4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,MJ Nicholls,"1,995",3968,4,"August 4, 2010","It's taken me two years to get around to reading this much-hyped modern classic. In that time, I have put up four shelves, had intercourse over twenty times, eaten nine scones, and met one Scottish celeb. His name will not be published here, as he was rude about my purple-brown shirt. Fool.Dave Eggers is preoccupied with heart-rending human dramas of Promethean magnitude, as his follow-up books What is the What and Zeitoun attest: he is that long arterial cord thingie linking the heart with the mind. So it's hard to review such a maddening and addictive, charming and twee, frenetic and furious, hilarious and infuriating novel as this. Compared to his follow-up work, this memoir is light and breezy. The adventures of a recently orphaned lower-middle-class writer, building his reputation for literary innovation while raising his kid brother Toph, are hardly dripping with the pain and suffering of Valentino Achek Deng.Yet Eggers writes in a such a dazzling and strange way, you can't help but marvel at his literary magic. I left the book feeling slightly cold, however, somewhat overly aware of this book's artifice: the self-conscious asides reveal a jarring truth about the book-being-a-book that makes it hard to connect with on a visceral level. I think Eggers undermines himself, and in the final analysis, this impedes upon its lasting power.Still. We like Dave, do we not?",38,12
