9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Heather K (dentist in my spare time),"3,827",5502,1,"February 23, 2021"," *Unpopular opinion ahead!!!*  I have one thing to say: SCREW YOU, BENEDICT BRIDGERTON! I'll be the first to admit that I was really, really enjoying this story at the start. I mean, I adore Rosalyn Landor, who is a narrating queen, and I like Julia Quinn, who is very consistent for me. However, as I moved further and further along in the story, I realized that I wanted to punch Benedict in the face... hard.Benedict treats Sophie like utter trash. He blackmails her to either become his mistress or move into his family's house as a servant because he won't even entertain the idea of marrying someone as lowly as her, and then has the audacity to be insulted when she isn't genuflecting in gratitude. He tells her that if she doesn't tell him to stop WELL before they have sex, he won't be able to stop... because, apparently, he is an asshole. Well, that makes a VIRGIN feel safe and loved. He sexually harasses her, ignores her pleas to be left alone, and then is acts like a spoiled baby when he finds out her true identity. HE IS TRASH. The only person who I liked was Benedict's mom, who at least finds some courage to do something and think outside the box. I'm still angry about this book, even after I finished it.

Going into An offer from a Gentleman I was a bit worried. I had a friend tell me that Benedict (the hero) ask Sophie (the heroine) to be his mistress over and over for most of the book. That he went on about how she wasn't of his class. She had told me it ruined the read for her. I hate that mistress bullshit in books. It's one of the reasons I avoided most historical romance novels for years. I hate cheating! A mistress is just a side chick, that wasn't good enough to marry. That shit bothers me. It's just so disrespectful to women. Yes I know that was how things were back then but it still pisses me off. However I was enjoying this series so much that I figured I would just have to take one for the team. Read it and get it over with I don't have to love it just read it and then I could go to the next book. Shockingly I really ended up loving this book. 
  
This book reads as a cute retelling of Cinderella, with poor Sophie being the mistreated bastard daughter of an earl. Julia Quinn did a great job of making Sophie's step-mother Araminta a total evil bitch. I hated her so much and I felt she didn't get her comeuppance. I really wanted her to pay for the things she did to Sophie and her own daughter Posy. I thought Sophie was a wonderful heroine. She was sweet, resilient, a bit sassy, and smart. I love that she had such dignity. I was a little worried I would dislike Benedict, but I really loved him too. I did get a tad upset that he kept asking her to be his mistress, but not like I thought I would. I felt he loved her and treated her well. With that and the way things were way back when, and the fact that he realized he was wrong for asking that of her and apologized. I found myself forgiving Benedict right along with Sophie. 
  
I thought Benedict and Sophie were a cute together. I loved that their relationship was built up so well. That fact is most likely what made it easier to forgive Benedict for the whole ""be my mistress"" crap. On top of loving Sophie and Benedict, I adore the Bridgertons. The whole family is just so easy to love. I also really liked Sophie's step-sister Posy. I was glad that in the end she wasn't overlook and forced to deal with the evil that was her mother. This retelling of Cinderella was cute and flowed well. I had to stop once to feed my family and I found myself thinking about the book the whole time. I couldn't wait to get back to it and see what happened next. That is the mark of a great book. I can't wait to read Colin's book. On a side note, I listened to this book on Audio and Rosalyn Landor did an amazing job of bringing this story to life. ",225,14
9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Nilufer Ozmekik,"2,065",38100,2,"November 3, 2022","Oh hell no! This is not the love story I wished to read! Mansplaining, gaslighting, extremely hero and naive, kind, tormented heroine who still believes in him! Where the hell is that artsy, coy, carefree, vulnerable, bisexual, kind Benedict! Isn’t he portrayed like that on streaming series? At this book: he is portrayed like a manipulative Sun of a beach ( you know the original words) Nope, this is not the same Benedict and this liar, controlling man is not the hero we deserved to read about! After seeing the chances at the books, I think I will skip them and directly start watching series! ( even though the second season was not steamy enough to satisfy viewers’ attraction)  When I started to read the beginning I thought this book was retelling of Cinderella and it was totally fine with me if Benedict ( everything comes back to him) could be great Prince Charming instead of efficient, meticulous arsehole! Sophie Beckett is poor, unlucky girl, bastard child of earl, who is placed in the custody of her father’s new wife before her dear father passed away! Her stepmother is worse than Cindy’s stepmom ( she’s something between Evil Queen and Kris Jenner)  Sophie wants to do something for herself before accepting her new torturous life and she attends the masquerade ball, meeting with the arse… I mean Benedict. At the end of the night she disappears and two of them never see each other for three years till their fates intercept and Benedict blackmails her to become his mistress! Because he can not marry with a girl from lower class.  I’m stopping right here! Because I’m truly pissed! I’m repeating: this is not my cup of Chardonnay and truly not the love story I want to read! I hope screenwriters made necessary changes with the characters and incidents and turn this assholish version of Benedict into tolerable human being. But I have to admit I didn’t like this book at all!",219,4
9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Jessica ,"2,014",12800,5,"November 25, 2020","It's official. Benedict is my favorite Bridgerton. So far. From the start, I absolutely adored this book and how it was a Cinderella retelling. My heart went out to Sophie because she's a bastard child and was never really treated well. Then, her father passed away, and she was basically a slave for her awful step mother. One night, her fellow servants dress her up and send her to a ball, where she has an amazing time dancing the night away with Benedict. I really loved Benedict and how he always felt looked over because he was just the second Bridgerton. I loved him so so much. He was more quiet and wanted more out of life, and it was so cute how he loved to draw in secret. I wanted him to find his happiness with Sophie and for him to be with her no matter what her social ranking was. I just loved this entire book. There was so much angst between Benedict and Sophie and I loved how involved Violet was. The entire Bridgerton family is so endearing and I cannot wait to read Colin's book next! ",191,9
9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Jacob Proffitt,"2,851",1490,1,"October 23, 2018","This is third in the Bridgertons series. Couples from the first two show up and some events are referenced and there are definite winks at those who have read the others. In all, I recommend reading these in order.Normally, I'd snark about skipping this one because it sucks, but I'm a definite outlier in that opinion. Most of my GR friends rated this very high so you might want to take this review with a grain of salt. Or more. I'll admit that I'm relieved that my problem isn't related to the Cinderella pattern overlaying the story. I expected that to warp the story more than it did but it was relatively benign, all told.Like Cinderella, Sophie's defining characteristic is being a victim. Her life sucks and that's largely due to having suck parents. Her step-mother is a complete monster but her father wasn't a gem, either. The story breaks from the Cinderella mold about there. There's a costume ball where she loses an article of clothing that gives a clue to her identity and then we're done with the fairy tale. Benedict doesn't use it to track her down, her situation changes and Quinn pretty much forges her own story from there. This is not a bad thing, except that I had hoped for a bit more cheerful good will and kindness and that's not Sophie. She feels every bit of the injustice done her. She's not a complainer or anything, but man her life sucked and being cheerful in the face of that would have been expecting a bit much.Benedict, on the other hand, is not a prince, is not charming, and spends most of the story bullying Sophie to get what he wants. He has a single act of humanity (saving her from being raped), but that's not so much to his credit as it is kind of the baseline of what I'd expect from a human being witnessing her plight. And it's all downhill from there. He has zero compassion and less empathy and is forever thundering around manipulating and whining to get his own way. I kept waiting for a light to go off in his head for every new thing he learns about Sophie's life so far. In vain, it turns out.Exacerbating this empathy hole is the power differential between the two characters. It'd be one thing if he were being all demandy of someone who could reasonably stand up to him, but Sophie doesn't have that power. She has literally nobody in her corner and yet he feels perfectly justified forcing her to his will, up to and including threatening to turn her in for theft if she doesn't comply. A theft, by the way, that he'd be making up. So it's not enough to threaten to leave her in the middle of nowhere with no money or even spare clothing. No, he has to threaten being transported to some hideous place like Australia. Frankly, I'm thinking she'd get the better end of the deal if she had made him carry through. There's got to be someone non-horrible in Australia and heaven knows that she has nothing keeping her in England.I finished the last half of this in a kind of hate-fueled fugue. I should have dnf'd. I knew I should have. But I kept going. I do like the Bridgerton family and Violet (the mom) continues to shine, here. Her empathy and support and love was the one bright light in this otherwise blighted story.A note about Steamy: There's a single explicit sex scene and a couple that were nearly there. So this is light on my steam tolerance. I kind of hated every intimate advance, however, because Benedict is such a complete snotrag. How can she even stand being around the man, let alone kissing him? Ugh.",167,18

    “In her heart she longed for this man, dreamed of a life that could never be.” 
  
Now, before I start rambling on the wonderful moments I expecienced when I followed Sophie and Benedict's journey, I need to state that those three starts you see above do not mean I didn't enjoy An Offer From a Gentleman, because I did. The imprint of my butt on my living room's couch can attest to that. It's just that I enjoyed more The Duke and I and The Viscount Who Loved Me (which is my favorite so far), and I have to be fair and rank them accordingly. Putting that aside, An Offer From a Gentleman was a tad different from its predecessors. It was a Cinderella retelling, infused with sizzling tension, a generous dose of angst and drama, and the trademark Bridgerton humor and impossible situations that can warm even the coldest heart. Sophie is the illegitimate daughter of an earl, relegated to a servant by her cruel stepmother further to her father's death. But Fate smiles on her when (with a little help) she manages to attend the Bridgerton masquerade ball and meets the Second Son, Benedict, who is immediately besotted by the mysterious young woman with the silver dress. For one night, Sophie feels happy. Wanted. Belonging. But when the clock strikes midnight, the bubble bursts and she returns to her hard life, which is about to get harder. Two years pass by. Benedict has not forgotten that woman, but when he meets an intriguing servant that sees straight through his soul, he is torn and confused: should he move on, or wait for the mysterious woman to reappear and find his happily ever after with her? Little does he know that Sophie Beckett is both women.When you dive in the third instalment of the Bridgerton series, you don't attend many social events. You don't lose yourself waltzing or avoiding Ambitious Mamas (or going after eligible bachelors, depending on the side of this deadly race). On the contrary, you sew and clean and dream of a better life next to a girl who has never experienced love or affection, who cannot forget even for a single moment that she was born out of wedlock and spent half her life serving the people who were supposed to be her family. Sophie is a resilient character, true to her ideals, determined to never repeat her mother's mistakes and sentence her children to the contempt and disapproval of the society she faced all those years. But how is it possible to preserve her dignity and her morals when her Prince Charming, the man that haunts her dreams, reddens her cheeks and makes her crave things no proper maiden should offers her a life without struggles and destitution, in exchange for her beliefs and the vow to herself? Benedict Bridgerton wants Sophie with a burning passion. But she's a simple maid, he cannot possibly marry her, so he asks her to become his mistress. And that's what left a bitter taste in my mouth. Not the proposal, per se, but his insistence and self-absorption. Benedict was a caring, sweet yet sarcastic character who at times was very endearing, but these two traits, and the refusal to understand Sophie's motives, were the reason I (occasionally) wanted to smack his beautiful head. Sophie, on the other hand, she was admirable and strong, but her tendency to keep secrets perplexed the situation and caused (unnecessary) drama and heartbreak. However, I felt this story to my very bones. I ached, laughed (especially when the wonderfully loud Bridgerton family made an appearance), swooned and sighed, and that's what makes Julia Quinn, and the historical romance genre (please remind me to write a review for Secrets of a Summer Night sometime this year) ideal when I am in the mood for not particularly complicated, yet heartwarming and delicious romance with a touch of fairydust, which, to be honest, happens a lot lately.So, since I may or may not have ordered the next two books, like another Lady Whistledown, I'll keep you posted on the whereabouts of the Bridgerton family this summer.",137,8

 The Written ReviewI feel like I'm getting whiplash looking at the goodreads ratings. 5 stars - 1 star - 3 stars - 1 star - 5 starsLike... is this good or no?UpdateIt was good. Not as good as the first couple, but still decent!The Written ReviewIn this Bridgerton book, we follow the second oldest Bridgerton child - Benedict. He's moody, temperamental and above all, in love with a woman he doesn't know.Sophie Beckett is a Cinderella story through and through. She's the bastard child of an earl and her father places young Sophie in the custody of his new wife before passing away. And the new Stepmother? Cruel to the core. Sophie decides to do one, grand gesture before accepting her lot in life - she dresses up and attend a masquerade ball and stumbles into one Benedict Bridgerton.And it truly is a night she'd never forget...and three years later, when she makes her escape from the step-monster's house, she finds him again. Only he does not recognize her.Should Sophie say something? Or should she resign herself to being a true outcast?Mmmm....I didn't like this one as much as I hoped.Book 1 follows the Duke and Daphne - the witty barbs they trade along with the hilarious banter cinched them as a couple. Book 2 follows Anthony and Kate - who fit together so perfectly, despite them not realizing it at the time.And Book 3 follows a pigheaded jerk and a girl foolish enough to trust him.What I'm trying to say is that all of the books have their own problems. Sexism, misogyny, classism, etc. But normally (i.e. Books 1 and 2) the characters and the plot are good enough that I could manage it. But in book 3, Benedict was just an ass for most of the story. I feel like the author was trying to go the ""look at the biggest, baddest rake yet! Only Sophie can tame him!"" route but in reality...was he even worth taming? I mean, he does come around a bit at the end but even then...not my first, second, third...tenth...hundredth...choice in husband for the wonderful Sophie.",134,7
9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Nadine in NY Jones,"2,700",208,1,"January 8, 2012","I like Julia Quinn, I really do, but this was not her finest moment. Looking back on ""Bridgertons"" #1 & #2, maybe this just is not her finest series. This book was so ... blah. And the hero was such an ASS. On the plus side, it was nice that the heroine was not from conventional society, she is the bastard daughter of an earl, raised as his ward until his death, at which point she is Cinderella to the evil stepmother and two step-sisters. (She even secretly goes to a ball, meets the hero, and then flees at midnight. I really liked the fairytale aspect and had high hopes for the book at that point. That was before I knew the hero was going to turn out to be an ass.)The hero is the second Bridgerton son, Benedict. The heroine is Sophia (Sophie) Beckett. They meet, they fall in love, she flees, they don't see each other for years, she finds work as a housemaid, he saves her from rape and catches cold while rescuing her, she nurses him back to health in a little ""cottage"" he happens to own (yeah, got the hurt-comfort going both ways there), he teases her mercilessly, she falls in love with him all over again. Well, so far so good - it's a little tedious, a little blah, but not SO bad. They start making out on the forest floor, and this is where is all goes wrong. Our Sophie, being a bastard child herself, has vowed to never ever have sex out of wedlock, since she cannot bring her own horrid fate on her child. So, while she really REALLY wants to schtup our hero, she says no. He invites her to be his mistress, and want for nothing. She turns him down. He continues to push the issue. This is where he becomes an ass. (SPOILER AHEAD) It'll come as no surprise to hear that he does eventually talk her into have sex with him (ASS) and she regrets the action, although she loves him and it was a moment to treasure, blah blah blah ... He CONTINUES to insist that she become his mistress, even after she has quite CLEARLY told him no, and even told him WHY. He says ""well surely you can't expect me to marry you!"" ASS. More events unfold until the inevitable denouement, which I'm sure you can guess, though I will not reveal all (for those few who may be surprised). By this time I was so completely disgusted with him that I couldn't possibly be happy for them.Hmm I was going to give this 2 stars, but I just got so worked up writing this review, remembering how awful he was to her, how he pressured her relentlessly for sex ... it's got to be 1 star.",91,8
9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Anne,"3,785",6900,3,"April 12, 2022","3.5 starsSince the Bridgerton books aren't really fairytale-themed, I was sort of surprised when I realized this was a retelling of Cinderella.I love me some retellings!This was actually the least Bridgerton-y of all of Quinn's Bridgerton books. And I mean that in the very best way. This one didn't have the same formula - and thank god for that! If you've read these books, you'll more than likely know exactly what I mean. If not and you're curious you can check out my review for book #7 because I don't want to beat a dead horse in this review.Ok, so the mother, Violet, was actually really great in this one. And I've kind of hated her in every other book. <--so, wow.And the 2nd epilogue was reallyreallyreally good! Every other 2nd epilogue that's been added in has kind of sucked, so I wasn't expecting to love this one, and I did. It was so sweet.Now, this one did have the same problem that a lot of Quinn's male leads suffer from, which is this annoying tendency to say cringy shit in the bedroom. There's a lot of words like shush and trust me that I find a tad patronizing. And then the mother of all fuckers if you want to stop, you must tell me NOW or I shan't be able to help myself. Because yes, you absolutley can help yourself 5 minutes from now, you douchebag.I see a lot of people are mad at Benedict for not even considering it a possibility that he and Sophie marry at first, and then insisting that she take up residence as his mistress because she's a lower class (servant) than he is with his aristocratic blood.I can't really disagree.That attitude doesn't exactly lend itself to making women who love romance novels look favorably on him. And I'd say that the problem is the book was written 20 years ago and just suffering from old age syndrome, but I remember what I was like 20 years ago, and I would have disliked Benedict for that sort of thing just as much then.So. Yeah, that was just a poor choice on Quinn's part. I think it would have looked a bit better if he had just jumped in with both feet and let Sophie be the one to say it wouldn't work because of their difference in backgrounds. Coming from her, you could chalk it up to society & self-esteem issues. Coming from him, it just sounds like he's a pompous ass.But I'm not a best-selling novelist, so what the hell do I know?Ok. Did anyone else think it was weird that Sophie never mentioned any of the servants? Like If I were a servant, and knew how badly they were treated or treated like less than, and then somehow I became the mistress of the house I think I would meditate on what kind of employer I would be in the future. Don't you think you'd be really sympathetic toward the people who were brushing your hair, and cooking your breakfast, and emptying your chamber pots? But once Sophie becomes Benedict's wife, you never hear her say that she's going to do anything differently in her home. Not really. She's just hella glad that she is where she's supposed to be now. I mean, you know Sophie won't be a bitch, but I guess what I'm saying is that I would have liked to have heard her views on servants now that she was the one in charge.Also, what happened to the servants in this story? You'd think that Sophie would reach out to the housekeeper that she was close to as a child, right? I mean, she and the other housemaids that helped Sophie get ready for the ball (and why would they risk their jobs for her like that?!) were never mentioned after that scene. If the point of the story was that Benedict needed to see Sophie as someone just as important as himself, then all of the servants should have been important. But it was mentioned that Sophie felt stuck between two worlds because she had been educated and therefore couldn't really relate to the other paupers.Ehhhh. It seemed like at some point she would have made friends with the people she worked with. You know, unless those sorts of people don't have real feelings.Peasants. Tsk.And speaking of real feelings. The scene where Benedict comes upon Sophie being attacked by these drunk nobles from the house party he was leaving, didn't make me feel particularly warm and fuzzy. Yes, he stops them from raping her. And while I appreciate that, he did it in this very flippant way. Almost like he was inwardly sighing that he had to be a decent chap and put an end to this tomfoolery. I think it was supposed to make him look cool and suave, but there are some things in life that should make you lose your shit. It wasn't until he got to know Sophie as a person that he looked back and got upset over what could have happened to her. Then again, this was never supposed to be the sort of novel that makes you think. It's just a fluffy romance and I should probably quit picking it apart. And I actually hate to admit this, but even with all of the problems, this was still one of the more interesting/better Bridgeton books to me.",90,10

I enjoyed every minute of it especially when Araminta gets her just desserts.The Bridgertons are such a wonderful family it is fun whenever they appear.

    In his heart he’d always believed there was only one perfect woman out there for him.His heart had been right. There was only one.
  
An Offer From a Gentleman is the third Bridgerton book and it's Benedict, the second Bridgerton's book. Benedict and Sophie meet at a masquerade ball. Benedict is in high society standing, where Sophie is not of the same class. Nothing can ever come from their meeting, but Benedict doesn't know that. He's had the lady from the ball on his mind for two years, when he finally runs into Sophie again. Only he doesn't realize it's her. Only Sophie knows that secret. Benedict is a bit of a savior for Sophie. She's had a hard life after being raised by her evil stepmother. I adored Sophie and Benedict's love story. It was heartwarming, sweet, and gave me the warm fuzzies. I know it's part of the times, but the only thing I didn't love was  How Benedict pressured Sophie to be his mistress because he couldn't stand to lose her. I understood it, but I thought it was selfish of him nonetheless.. This was another great addition to this series and I can't wait to get to Colin's story next!

9408584,An Offer From a Gentleman,Brittany McCann,"1,461",378,2,"January 23, 2023","Benedict destroys all that could be good in this novel. This title is misleading because Benedict, sure as F, isn't a gentleman. At this point, I am noticing a disturbing theme in the Bridgerton siblings. They all think that their sexual urges/needs are more important than anything else. The excuses are endless, mostly blamed on love or a selfish need that rules one's senses. This is so disgusting to me that this is the main theme of this novel. It makes all that is good pale in comparison. I really like SHOW Benedict, but book Benedict needs to be stoned. His actions echo more of show Anthony's personality. Sophie is a likable enough character. Weirdly, most of the novel is from her perspective, when really with most sexual urges and judgments of women not mattering due to their placement at birth Benedict. *gag me now*. I felt bad for Sophie and how much she justifies the sexual pressure due to her love for Benedict. This relationship is so emotionally abusive I wanted to shake some sense into her. She spends at least 70-80% of the time justifying him. I honestly didn't have any issue with the intro Cinderella thread that Julia Quinn gave us, as it was such a small part of the overall narrative and was a good catalyst for plot movement.The highlight of this book is more of Violet (mom), whom I love. However, I am starting to judge the crap out of her for her kids. She sees this and is worried to an extent, but everything is just ""explained"" away for the time period. Again I get the regency time period, but my God, am I glad that I do not have to live in this shit storm of time. Will I continue with the series? Yes. The highlight is the sibling relationship, and that was lacking a lot in this book. There was a lot of preview of Hyacinth that I enjoyed, and I can tell she will be a hellion. I have been waiting for Collin's book, and please don't let him be as big of an ass hat as his older brothers.Quotes of what the F is wrong with this predatory bastard:""There were a thousand things that Benedict wanted to ask her...He was so damned afraid she would change her mind if he allowed her to put any of her thoughts into words..."" umm this feels like a date-rape mindset to me...""He knew that she wanted respectability, but she knew he could not give it to her.""""It would mean compromise, mostly on her part.""
