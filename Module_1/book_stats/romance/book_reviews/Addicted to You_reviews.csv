55475442,Addicted to You,mel ‚òΩ,365,6532,2,"November 16, 2021","2.5 starsme talking to myself before reading this book:""im not gonna read this. nuh uh üò©üëãüèº""""no for real bishh don't read this. you read the blurb - h being a sex addict and H being an alcoholic. this will just stress you the f out. you have TWO midterms this week, sit your ass down and Don't You. Dare. read this or i-""
  ""... i fucking read it.""
i SWORE to myself that i was just going to skim read this and only read the parts where Rose and Connor interact so im prepared for Kiss the Sky but one thing lead to another and i ended up taking an 8 hour break from studying so alas here i am. ~ went in for Rose and Connor, came out wanting to read the whole damn thing just to see more Rose, Connor and Ryke content ~aaand what do i have to say about Lily and Lo? well...Lily (a sex addict) + Lo (an alcoholic) = T O X I Ci can't really rant about this book without spoiling so, // SPOILERS AHEAD //this whole book was a painful ‚ú®mess‚ú® the first 39% had a lot of OM drama and a little bit of OW drama for 2 chapters where Lily hears Lo with another girl, Cassie and that OW stayed with them for a week or something and then it was over. and as for OM drama well... she is a sex addict so she wasn't celibate. AND THEN when they finally get together that's where all the toxic shit happens. there were more bad than good that happened here and most of the time i do feel bad but other times i get so frustrated because of how selfish they both are- especially Lily. but i can't exactly be really mad at them cuz of their addiction and well, selfishness is the reality for addiction so- everything is just COMPLICATED. again, it's really hard to like or even relate to the main characters and root for their relationship because they both enabled each other's addictions and there's also not much depth to the characters as they were all about their vices so that's why i couldn't connect with them (side note: i only think this way the first time i read this but i've read almost half of the addicted/calloway series and lemme tell y'all,,, lili and lo?? I'LL DO ANYTHING TO PROTECT THESE TWO FICTIONAL CHARACTERS. imma keep my original thoughts here because not only did lily and lo had a character development but i did as well when it comes to my feeling between these two).also, i know Lily is suffering from her addiction but i feel so uncomfy whenever her mind wanders off and checks random guys out and creates sexual fantasies in her head and this happened a few times even when she and Lo were already together. i also feel uncomfy when she finds it hard NOT to cheat despite all this, i can appreciate how the authors showed - not told - the struggles and negative aspects of what sex addicts go through and how it can impact friendships and family relationships. it felt real to me so that's why it was so painful to read. but again, there's A LOT more bad than good in this book in every sense so yeah it makes sense for every encounter to be painful. though, i just finished Ricochet now and lemme tell y'all- Lily's character development tho. YES.‚ûµ 
  Connor and Rose + Ryke
alright, alright now let's talk about these three. FIRST of all.‚Äî Ryke: i had no idea who he was before this but like... he can get it.‚Äî Connor: yes i do the cooking, yes i do the cleaning üòå‚Äî Rose: *bends the knee* MAH QUEEN.i really can't wait to read Calloway series but these three really made me want to read the whole damn series. i literally have like- 3 books to get through before Kiss the Sky. rip.aaand i was NOT expecting Ryke to be that to Lo. i loved him because he was supportive and seemed to care more about his well-being but... mind-fucking-BLOWN. it makes sense now why he's like that!!if you ask me who i like more, Connor or Ryker? please don't ask me thx.* * *listen, listen. im a newbie to this whole fandom/series and i don't know anyone so bear with me. i originally wanted to just read the Calloway sisters series for Rose and Connor because i've been seeing tons of edits of them and i'm currently in a mood to binge read another series so i was like ehh why not, it's not like i have exams and papers coming up and it's not like i have an exam in an hour or so right?? anyway, stan Connor and Ryke for clear skin ‚ú®

55475442,Addicted to You,Christy,"3,706",31500,4,"February 24, 2019","4.5 stars! Addicted to You is a story that is just that- addictive. I can‚Äôt imagine finishing this book and not needing to dive right into the next. I can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôve waited this long to read this series, but I‚Äôm kind of glad I did. I can binge read them all now. :D Lily and Lo are childhood friends and a couple as far as everyone knows. In reality, they‚Äôre both addicts. Lo is an alcoholic and Lily is a sex addict. They both come from rich, affluential families and if their families ever found out, it would be bad. So they pretend. They pretend to be a couple, pretend to be together to take the heat off one another. In reality, they are best friends and enablers for each others addictions. They are always there for each other and always have each other‚Äôs backs. Even if their relationship isn‚Äôt the healthiest, you can tell their friendship is real and so it the love between them.
  
     ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a permanent fixture in my life. You're not going anywhere.‚Äù 
  
 After carrying on this charade for years, something happens between this couple. They both come to realize their feelings are stronger than just friendship. They love each other as more than friends. Even with their addictions, they want to try. Try to turn what first started as a facade into something real. Become a real couple. Maybe Lo can drink less and maybe Lily can control her addiction to being only with Lo. Just maybe they can do this together‚Ä¶ 
  
    ‚ÄúI want to love you more than I love this.‚Äù
  
 Both of these characters are destructive, damaged and flawed. And I loved them both. Lo is such a fantastic guy- he had so many issues of his own but he loves Lily fiercely and wants her to be his. I adored him. I also loved all of the secondary characters- Ryke, Connor, even Rose by the end. I can‚Äôt wait to read more about them and I‚Äôm happy to know they‚Äôll be getting their own books! This story had such a unique plot. I loved that even though both of the main characters fed their addictions, they really did care about one another and honestly cared more about helping the others than helping themselves. By the end they learned sometimes you have to help yourself first before you can help the person you love. I have a feeling in Ricochet they will both face many challenges but I hope that their love will endure and pull them through battling their demons. The writing style was perfect- I couldn‚Äôt believe that this was written by two people, it had such a great flow. Addicted to You is the start of an intense, emotional, edgy and addictive series that you won‚Äôt want to miss out on! ",248,69
55475442,Addicted to You,Aestas Book Blog,"1,059",74800,5,"February 25, 2014"," WOW!!! I have found a new favorite series!!! I swear it was like this book was written for me. It had all the elements I love in a story -- great writing, deeply flawed but lovable characters and an emotional intensity that kept drawing me further and further in. I'm totally addicted ;) The story is about Lily and Lo. They're childhood friends who have grown up together but they each have an addiction -- she's addicted to sex, he's addicted to booze -- and if their very wealthy and controlling families ever found out, they'd both be kicked to the curb... and so they lie.¬†They live together and pretend to be a normal, perfectly functioning couple and by doing so each one gives the other an alibi and a safe zone to feed their addiction.
  
    ""We lied for each other and hid our infidelities, playing the role of doting boyfriend and girlfriend. The deeper we sink, the harder it is to crawl out. I fear the moment when‚Ä¶ someone discovers our secrets. At any moment, everything can crumble beneath us.""
  
But sometimes there are moments when their pretend relationship feels like the most real thing in the world because what neither of them are admitting out loud is that their feelings for each other are real.
  
    ""In this moment, I'm yours.""
  
By covering for each other and understanding what it was that they each needed, they'd found a way to cope with their addiction. It might not have been healthy but neither of them could stop and they found a balance, albeit a dangerous one, that worked for them... But everything changed when they were forced to go on a family yacht trip -- sequestered together away from any possibility of enabling their addictions in secret, the only thing they had was each other...I'm going to stop here but seriously, I just LOVED the whole storyline. I felt so deeply invested in it and I read so many scenes with that butterflies-in-my-belly feeling. I don't know... there's just something about flawed, damaged characters who clearly love each other SO much and are trying as hard as they can do make it through something together that just strongly tugs at my heartstrings.Both Lily and Lo were such intriguing characters. The whole story is told from Lily's POV and I really have to commend the authors with the way they were able to portray her addiction -- the vicious cycles, her need, her self loathing, her dependence on it. It would have been very easy to make Lily just seem like a slut but they wrote it in such a way that you could genuinely feel that this was an¬†addiction - no different than¬†drugs or alcohol. It wasn't just about someone who was promiscuous, this was something that was much more deeply wired in her.And Lo... OMG Loren Hale totally stole my heart!! He was such a deeply tormented and flawed character and it was so clear how¬†much he cared for Lil but I could also sense his inner conflict at not wanting to step in the way of what she needed while he himself was such a slave to his own addictions.
  
His voice lowers‚Ä¶ ""I don't have any right to tell you to stop...¬†I'm here for you. Always.""

They were oddly perfect for each other. They each understood the deep seeded addiction the other suffered. They'd seen each other at their worst and the way they¬†cared for each other (and I'm not even talking romantically, I just mean¬†caring from one person to another) was just so incredible heart wrenching.... I mean, HOLY EMOTION!!!!And all these hidden feelings were building in the background so by the time they actually took their relationship to the next level and officially became a couple, these feelings all came to the surface and I just¬†felt it so strongly!!!!
  
    ""I'm not one of your conquests,"" he says in a throaty voice. ""I know what you want, and you don't need to take it. I can give it to you...¬†Let me try,"" he says, his hand cupping my face. ""Let me try to be enough for you.""
  
GAHHHH!!!!! That scene!!!!! I'm getting all emotional just thinking about it!! I love Loren Hale!! I love how much he loved Lily and how he didn't try and change her per say. It would have been so easy for a guy in his position to be jealous and irrational given the type of addiction she had but he accepted it all as a part of her. He didn't just love her and put up with her addiction, he accepted her as a package deal.Ok - now, I know that some of you are going to be curious as to whether or not there is cheating in this (especially given Lily's addiction) and I'm happy to say that¬†no¬†- there is no cheating. However, before they're officially a couple she does sleep around but, with the way it was written, I totally understood it and Lo understood it too. This story just has totally different parameters than a normal romance would. But after they become a couple, there is no sleeping around at all.Towards the ending, the emotions began to intensify as their addictions began to take a stronger hold of them. You could feel the breaking point coming and it hurt to see these characters who I loved so much falling so far. I cared¬†so much for them but had to wait for them to save themselves. My heart goes right out to Lily and Lo and I can't wait to see them overcome the obstacles that I know will be their future. But I have faith in them and I believe that their love for each will be strong enough to get them through it.While there isn't a brutal cliffhanger at the ending, it definitely leaves you wanting more¬†right away!! Think kind of along the lines of a Find You In The Dark style ending.But luckily the next books,¬†Ricochet and Addicted For Now are both available so you'll have more of the story to immediately move on to.This series has me hooked!! I'm totally addicted and can't wait for more of Lily & Lo!¬†‚ô•Rating: 4.5+ starsMy review of Book #1.5 ‚ûú http://bit.ly/1baSZSKMy review of Book #2 ‚ûú http://bit.ly/1baTdJGMy review of Book #3 ‚ûú http://bit.ly/McHotQ**************************** For more of my reviews, book news and updates:‚ú¶ Main blog: Aestas Book Blog‚ú¶ Facebook Blog Page‚ú¶ Twitter ",222,80
55475442,Addicted to You,Matilda,217,1198,2,"December 20, 2021","2 starsNot only did I age about 10 years while reading this, but the amount of enabling by both Lily and Loren was starting to trigger me. I understand addiction, I‚Äôve seen it, but enabling someone‚Äôs addiction and knowing that you‚Äôre doing it makes you partially responsible for anything that happens to them.Lily was just a bad person all around. She‚Äôs extremely fucking selfish and she‚Äôs selfish enough where it wasn‚Äôt possible to justify all of it by her sex addiction. The girl refused to acknowledge Loren‚Äôs alcoholism until Ryke forced her to because what? She didn‚Äôt want to lose him? Because his existence enables her and she needs that? I couldn‚Äôt stand the way she refused to seek help despite understanding that she has an addiction and that it‚Äôs debilitating. He enables my addiction. Always has. And the longer we‚Äôre together, he always will.I also wanted to acknowledge a particular moment where Lily states‚Äî
‚ÄúBut you don‚Äôt need me to drink. You don‚Äôt have to ask me to fix a whiskey sour. Your addiction doesn‚Äôt infiltrate my life like mine does yours.‚Äù‚ÜíI mean is she serious right now? The fact that she‚Äôs refuses to talk to Loren about his addiction IS putting her at the very center of the problem.Lily is also just a hypocrite. She brings random guys to her and Loren‚Äôs apartment (even escorts) and has sex with them while Loren is in the next room, listening to everything. BUUUUUT, the second he does the same thing with one girl she goes off the deep end???Loren was definitely the better MC, but he was still extremely fucked up. He would purposely tease Lily and arouse her throughout the entire book, but especially before they entered their relationship. He did it because he wanted her to ask him to have sex and not use random men. That‚Äôs seriously not fucking okay and he would also do it constantly during their relationship, in front of other people and in public!Between Loren and Lily egging each other‚Äôs addiction on and Lily constantly being in heat, I didn‚Äôt feel anything for their relationship. To me it just felt like 2 very fucked up friends that started fucking, not 2 people in love. There wasn‚Äôt even a big ‚ÄòI love you‚Äô scene, it just sorta‚Ä¶happened. Ryke, Connor and Rose are definitely the standouts for me. Connor and Rose are absolutely adorable and I dig their enemies to lovers while Ryke is just perfect?? At this point I couldn‚Äôt care less about Lily and Loren‚Äôs relationship because they‚Äôre the type of people that should never ever be together.Personally, I have a hard time enjoying romances where characters are suffering with addictions. I think it has to do with me not being able to love characters when they love their addiction more than each other. But that's just me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",202,36
55475442,Addicted to You,Candace,"1,174",4130,3,"October 22, 2016","Well, this was certainly different! I've had this book sitting on my shelf for a long time. Finally, I got a chance to listen to it. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but this wasn't it. That isn't necessarily bad though. I'm still trying to wrap my head around this story.First off, let me just say that both of the main characters are completely screwed up! Lily is a sex addict, sleeping her way through her early-twenties like there's no tomorrow. Meanwhile, Loren, aka ""Lo"", is drinking like a fish. Both of them are completely out of control.Best friends since early-childhood, this dysfunctional duo is deserving of an after-school, Lifetime movie special. Holy hell, they were frustrating! Talk about co-dependent and enabling! These two needed some serious help.Oddly, it was their addictions that made them more human. Even though their behaviors were appalling, their weaknesses made them personable. Otherwise, I'm not sure that I ever would have been able to feel any sort of connection to the two trust fund babies. There was just nothing about their privileged lifestyle that I could relate to. Although addiction isn't something I can necessarily relate to either, it helped to see them as flawed humans that also have struggles.As their addictions spin more wildly out of control, circumstances change. Lily and Lo are willing to act on their feelings, even if it means risking what they have. One bad situation leads to another and the two cannot hide their problems any longer. While I enjoyed this story, I didn't love it. These two were a bit too dysfunctional for me at times. It does end without answering many questions, so I'll probably pick this series back up at some point. I hear that it gets better. After all, I am curious to see how these two manage on a more long-term basis. All in all, I'd say this was good, but not great. I give it 3 - 3 1/2 stars.",156,48

55475442,Addicted to You,Sophie,218,533,2,"February 12, 2022","Hah. This book was quite literally a garbage sandwich. I say that because I felt like the beginning was promising, I was kind of like, ""Oh wow, this premise is really unique, and the writing isn't half bad, let's see where this goes."" But the middle? Hot steaming f8cking garbage. The book did kind of redeem itself at the end though, I will give it that. I've given it like 2.5 stars because I did like some of it, just not roughly 60% of it. Lily is a sex addict. Lo is an alcoholic. They're both trust fund babies and long-time childhood friends. They live together and they've been pretending to be a couple for like 3 years so they can keep doing all of their problematic stuff. So- yeah, Lo drinks himself to oblivion and Lily has sex with a stranger (or 5) like every day and she always needs to be watching porn or something, you know, addict stuff. Lo kicks out Lily's one-night stands in the morning, Lily makes sure Lo sleeps on his side so he doesn't choke on his own vomit and die. You know, cute stuff like that. I could handle the dysfunctional relationship in the beginning. Yes, it was messed up and toxic but they had an arrangement, they weren't a couple and they didn't owe each other anything. It was almost kind of cute I was like, ""Haha, these guys are so f8cked up, but at least they have a sense of humor about it!"" Everything was fine basically until Connor and Ryke showed up.First of all, what kind of a f8cking name is Ryke? Is it supposed to be like, ""Rick""? or ""Rye-Kay""?? Like what the heck? He was annoying. I know Connor technically showed up first in the story, but I have to talk about Ryke first. Here are a series of letters I have written to each of the characters in this book because I don't know how else to express my grievances with them to you without addressing them directly first.Dear Ryke, Your name is spelled dumb. Why are you here? Literally nobody wants you here and they have said as much. Yes, thank you for that one time you helped carry Lo home because he passed out at your party, that was kind of cool of you, but now it's time to go. We've given you those comic books you never shut up about, now go away. Please and thank you. - me Dear Lo and Lily,Ryke is a journalist, who wants to know more about your lives, which are obviously f8cked up. You are the son and daughter of major corporations whose reputations could very obviously be ruined if people found out about the way you guys are living, why the actual hell didn't you kick out Ryke the second he told you he was a journalist?? Be better social elites.- me I realize that towards the end it becomes apparent why Ryke is so invested in Lo's life, but for the majority of the book, it's hard not to hate him because he just seems like a nosey pr8ck.Let's talk about the type-A power couple everyone seems to love so much in this book. Dear Rose, I dislike you. You show up at people's houses unannounced and that is just straight-up crappy. Plus you're just kind of mean for no reason. I started to like you more towards the end, but for the majority of the book, I was not a fan. - me Dear Connor, Wow, you're a real winner. You're basically like Ryke but worse. You're nosey and superficial and just soooooooooo arrogant it's not even funny. You are actively mean and say inappropriate things all the time and you think all women are gold diggers and yeah I obviously hate you. Frankly, you and Rose deserve each other. You can give people unsolicited life advice and show up at each other's houses unannounced together forever. - me Dear Lo, Hi. I get that you and Lily are friends and stuff and you like each other. Cool. What I don't get is the human miscommunication trope that is you. You are literally the king of mixed signals, so good job, you get an A+ in being confusing and condescending as f8ck, if that's what you were going for. I would be mad at you, but obviously, your life is super f8cked up and you are kind of not doing so great in terms of like, adulting/being a human, so I can't even really be mad at you. - me Dear Lily, Hi, honey. I did not need to hear about all of your detailed fantasies about literally every stranger you saw throughout this whole book. Also, I'm a little mad that you didn't make that poor Giggalo a cup of coffee. - meI understand that the whole point of this book was to illustrate how hard addiction is, be it sex or alcohol, or whatever. I actually really appreciated how in the beginning of the book that the author never described the sex that Lily had with strangers. I thought it was sort of a nice touch, speaking to the namelessness of all of Lily's sexual partners and her lack of emotional involvement with them. I get that Lily thinks about sex all the time, but eventually, I just got kind of sick about hearing all her dirty thoughts about essentially every human that existed in this book. In terms of the sex between Lily and Lo, I was actually very of disappointed. I felt like there was always no build-up and that it was awkwardly rough, personally I thought it would've been nicer if the author made their sex a little more tender and intimate, I wish she that she would've shown that having sex with someone you love is way more powerful and fulfilling and DIFFERENT than having sex with a stranger or someone you're not at all emotionally invested in or attached to. The ending was ok. Last like, 40 pages, better. Sort of. I know there are like 4 books left in this series, but I don't think I'm going to read them. Sorry, I know a lot of people liked this one, just- eh. meh.",134,17

 I LOVED THIS BOOK. I loved the characters, the writing, the storyline, how DIFFERENT it was from any other story I have read. It was emotional, heart breaking but refreshing, sometimes comical, full of drama, and also intense.Lily and Lo- Lifetime friends. Addicts. Lovers. Liars. And two of the most dysfunctional/flawed but amazing characters I have met. Lily is addicted to sex. Lo is addicted to alcohol. And they both use each other as a crutch to justify the addictions they cannot seem to control. They pretend to be a couple to their families, so they can continue to indulge in their addictions and not be questioned. After some time, they become a real couple, only to come to the conclusion that maybe they really aren‚Äôt that good for each other. Maybe feeding into one another‚Äôs addictions is only tearing them and their families apart. I was a little hesitant when I started this, knowing something as serious and intense as addiction isn‚Äôt something that is considered easy to read about. But the writing and characters (ESPECIALLY the side characters) drew me in and kept me there.I just love when I read a book and the characters begin to feel REAL to me. And that is precisely what happened here. It was like I could almost feel the love, the shame and guilt, the pain Lily & Lo were feeling as they battled their addictions. And in the end it was beautiful and heartwarming to see how their family battled along side them. Even though their relationship was an unhealthy one, the love between Lily & Lo will have you rooting for them to fight and get better.I seriously cannot wait to dive into the rest of this series!Addicted To You (Book 1) |http://amzn.to/2zRYSYS

BOOK reminding the reader over and over and over again how Lo makes her so horny (*sings oh me so horny ‚Äì me so horny ‚Äì me love you long time*), but they did it once a long time ago and can‚Äôt do it again because it will ruin their friendship, and even though he constantly leads her on and is all . . . .
  
she doesn‚Äôt ever take the hint and instead chooses to remind him incessantly that he shouldn‚Äôt do things like that to a sex addict while still wanting him to do stuff like that to a sex addict and oh for Jeebus‚Äô sake . . . . 
  
Which, of course, they finally do, but seriously for being a NA story with a disclaimer about all of the mature content as well as being about a SEX ADDICT there sure wasn‚Äôt a whole lotta sex ‚Äì it was more fade to black and innuendo rather than straight up . . . .
  
Plus, even though there were only around 325 pages to this book it felt like about eleventy trillion with all of the nothing happening except for bitching about needing to f*&^ all the time and the not-helping each other ever like STOP their totally unhealthy lifestyles until the very end which OF COURSE ended in a stupidass cliffhanger and no. Just no. I know this was supposed to really hit the old emotions, but for me????

Yes.Did I only finally read this -and will hopefully continue reading- just to get to read the companion Calloway series? Yes.Were I even slightly interested in Lo and lily‚Äôs story? Not really.Were they as dysfunctional and toxic and a potential train wreck as you might probably expect? Again yes. For now, I feel like Lo and Lily are just a means to an end and I‚Äôm not above using them to get to what or whose book I really want.",95,34
