54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,She-who-must-not-be-named ,179,1142,5,"February 17, 2022"," WARNING : TOO MUCH ANGST THAT IS INJURIOUS TO YOUR HEALTH There, I said it.The Book Gods have finally listened to my prayers and combined the ingredients of intriguing premise, ultra powerful protagonists, amazing secondary characters, captivating world and not to forget- delicious, tantalizing romance and poof - A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire was born- One that will woo you into its clutches and make your heart thrum at a faster rhythm in your chest, one that will make you smile like an idiot at one moment and leave you with countless tears the next, again plastering your face with a permanent grin owing to the very entertaining banter between characters. This book will bring out  all  your emotions.A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire begins with a compelling start and advances with more action, world-building and steamy romance. The writing was crafted beautifully and the visuals were lovely to read about. There are so many endearing aspects but one aspect is and will remain constant.   SPOILERS FOR From Blood and Ash, even in the comments' section  Hawke Flynn My heart, my world 💙. My obsession with him is quite simple. He laughs, I laugh. He is furious, I'm furious, he cries, I cry. He is breathtaking and intoxicating and all the other good adjectives I can come up with. He might have a lot of blood on his hands, but his gentility, intensity and soft-heart, especially where Poppy was concerned touched the fan girl in me.  ""I have a lot of blood on my hands, Poppy. Sometimes, so much that I don’t think they’ll ever be clean. So much that I. don’t know if I ever want them to be.""  Whatever Poppy  believed to be true was a lie. Watching her come to terms with all of it made my heart swell. She is the character that you will always respect and look up to. She is brave, valiant and fearless and her obsession with sharp objects and stabbing is something I'll never understand 😂 ‎ Kieran  ‎The best secondary character ever. His bond with Casteel warms me and his budding friendship with Poppy is raw and natural. He may be gruff on the outside, but he's a total sweetheart from within and I love him. Casteel and Poppy's romance is not something I can get over, ever. Their pretenses, their conversations, her retorts and his  inappropriate  behavior in the most inappropriate of times delights me. But their intensity, protective nature, and their readiness to sacrifice their lives for one another goes beyond physical and ignites my soul. For the most part, I was ANNOYED at how oblivious they were to each other's feelings. *Casteel melts Poppy with the intensity of his gaze* and yet Casteel : I don't have feelings for her.*Ignores all important discussions about his kingdom just to make sure Poppy's had cheese* Casteel:  I'm just using her to get my brother back, what are you saying-*Threatens to kill someone for eyeing Poppy and actually kills someone for being mean to her* AND *talks smut all the time and says ""I want you, Poppy"" at least a hundred times* and yet Casteel:  I don't feel any- Me: Yep. I could practically feel steam coming off of my ears and when they finally confessed, I could feel myself breathe again. JLA sure as hell played us! There were so many obstacles, frightening, hungry creatures, violence, ‎betrayal and horrific truths, but the pages of the book also brimmed with  trust, love and warmth .It takes a lot of effort and talent for an author to make readers gasp, fangirl, set their soul on fire, sick to their stomach and make them close their eyes and pray that things don't become utterly chaotic. I've only read two books of Jennifer L. Armentrout but I respect her for blindsiding me like that, for keeping me on my toes, barreling my way through the twists and turns of the book whilst also pleading with anticipation. Huge respect. I don't care who you are, but if you have a thing for sexy, addictive fantasies, then look no further. There's no way this book won't appease you.","1,091",97

54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,Sofia,294,5912,1,"December 4, 2021","If I wanted to learn how to walk, I would ask WikiHow. Ah, how I’ve missed Poppy Ballfoyer and Mr. Golden Violates Consent. In this book, they revisit some of their favorite skills—talking about nothing, insisting the other is lying, and fawning over eyeballs. 
  My heart stammered as my eyes locked onto his, orbs a shade of stunning, cool amber.
 
  “I’m doing that because I like lying on top of you.” “Well, I don’t,” I bit out. “That’s a lie.”
Kingdom of Flesh and Fire is basically 2000s YA paranormal Wattpad fiction.How do I summarize the plot when there is no plot? I can’t believe it took an entire book for Poppy to get from Solis to Atlantia. A whole book. A 637-page book. Nothing happened. No character development, no action. Just Casteel and Poppy pretending to hate each other but then kissing every other page.
  He smiled up at me, his eyes twin golden flames.
The world’s Twilight phase is finally dying, right? Don’t worry, Twihards. When the world needed Twilight the most, JLA appeared. She’ll save you with her buff vampires and buff werewolves and the biting of lips.
  Casteel watched me sleep? Wait.

  ”That’s creepy,” I murmured. “The watching me while I sleep part.”
She also stole from ACOTAR (uh, like everything: mates, Atlantians, the characters’ personalities) and Shadowhunters (parabatai). Nothing—and I mean nothing—about this book is original. 
  It turned his eyes from cool amber to warm honey.
The worldbuilding is still just names of real places with a letter changed. Is this trying to be subtle? What’s the difference between a Craven and a vampry? Nobody knows. The language in this book is confusing, as well. It’s a fantasy book, but words like yeah, okay, weird, hey, sucks, lemonade, weirds me out, nope, and wanna are used. 
  The golden hue of his irises had chilled.
“Casteel Hawkethrone Da’Neer.” *chokes on my cocoa*Even Rhysand It’s Your Choice But Not Really is better than Casteel. He’s seriously asking Poppy to marry him after forbidding her from leaving the house? And then he honestly believes he’s giving her a choice? He essentially says she’ll die if she doesn’t marry him. He keeps avoiding the question and ignoring her protests and basically forcing her into marriage. Is this a horror novel? 
  “It’s official,” Casteel said. “I’m going to have to kill him.”“What? Why?” “I don’t like the way he looks at you.” “How does he look at me?” “He looks at you like I do.”
Not Casteel pinning her to the bed and not letting go when she asks him to repeatedly. Not him killing someone for no reason and Poppy forgiving him because sHe BeTrAyEd yOu (fOr SoMeThiNg MiNiScULe) So It’S oKaY. 
  The intensity in those amber eyes held me captive.
Poppy and Casteel have this game they like to play called Pretend. No, they are not toddlers.Yes, they are adults. Mature adults? Debatable. But adults nonetheless. They yell at each other and then Poppy asks, “Can we play pretend?” Then they suddenly tolerate each other enough to get married. Communication at its finest. Speaking of communication, the queen of abusing ellipses and commas has returned! And she’s better than ever 😍
   “Are you… well?” I asked. “The wound appears...quite fierce.” “It is a very...fierce wound.”

  A fawn-colored one that reminded me of Kieran but smaller, limped backward away from a knight.
Does anyone actually proofread this?Of course, there has to be an infodump machine by the name of Alastir. He’s there to conveniently fill Poppy in on everything she doesn’t know. I wish I had an Alastir to tell me how to fix my life.
  I twisted toward him, ignoring the jump in my pulse as heavy, hooded, amber eyes met mine.
Poppy’s powers are random. She can do anything and there are no limits. Just whatever is convenient at the time. She was chosen because the gods “found her speshul.” Her power is a total plot convenience. Someone needs to be saved? Whoa, she has another power. She needs to get out of trouble? Whoa, she has another power. 
  Casteel’s eyes were like warm pools of gold.
0.0001 dArK sPiCe AnD PiNe stars; but why is there only one female character.____I can't believe it took Poppy 637 pages to travel from one place to another. They weren't even that far away. This book was a waste of time. I can feel my brain cells slipping away. Review to come...",579,111
54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,Val ⚓️ Shameless Handmaiden ⚓️,"1,794",27800,2,"March 23, 2021","2 Stars***Unpopular Opinion***Le sigh. I know I'm very much in the minority here, so keep that in mind; but off we go... Honestly, I feel like I could just rubber stamp this with a copy/paste of my review of book one, but I will will endeavor to sally forth some minimal effort. Well, okay, maybe some copy/pasting. In my review for book one I said:I feel like Jennifer L. Armentrout (JLA) saw the success of Twilight, A Court of Thorns and Roses, Throne of Glass, and Shadow and Bone and said...Because this book felt like a mashup of all of those series. Especially ACoTAR...for real though. And I still feel that way. I also said: ....holy boredom, Batman. The first 67%+ of this thing was so tedious. SO tedious. It's not so much that I hated it or anything, but more just, well...I feel like JLA could have achieved exactly what she achieved in the first 67% with about half the page count...Things finally started to pick up around 75% and I was happy as a clam by a solid 80% - which is the only reason I rated this thing above 2 stars, actually.I still feel that way as well...with the caveat that I was halfway bored until approximately 80%+ this time. Seriously though, people, borderline nothing happened in this book for a righteously solid chunk except an endless wallow through Poppy's thoughts. And if we weren't in her thoughts, we were listening to dialogue through which she basically repeated all the thoughts we just read about. There's a word for that, which I will ""think"" and ""speak"" simultaneously, you know, to save you the time I lost: redundant. When we weren't meandering through Poppy's redundant thoughts and dialogue, we were seemingly wandering aimlessly throughout the countryside and low-key mooning over each other while throwing tired witty verbal barbs like confetti at a surprise party.Also, at least a solid 30% of the book was any one of the following scenarios:-Poppy thinking about stabbing someone.-Poppy talking about stabbing someone. -Someone else talking about Poppy possibly thinking or talking about stabbing someone. -Poppy stabbing someone.-Poppy saying, ""I have a lot of questions."" -Someone else following that up with, ""Of course, you do.""-Other characters saying, ""I have questions.""-Poppy asking a ton of questions. About things we already read her thinking about or talking about. On fucking repeat. Very little happened in this book plot-wise until almost the very end. There was just so much chaff that could have been trimmed, so much aimless meandering through redundant everything: narrative, dialogue, even the characters. They all feel very interchangeable. With no development. And don't even get me started on how immature and clueless a lot of these seemingly centuries-old characters act and just feel on the page. Thank God for Kieran, though (the only character with half a personality) and the somewhat exciting ending, or I would have given this one star. In fact, it's only because of the ending that I will even consider continuing with this series. I must admit I am curious what will happen. But only then because I am going to wait to get book three from the library (like I waited for this one). Honestly, I just couldn't be bothered to actually spend the money finishing this otherwise. Edited to add: For those wondering...if I do read book three and dislike it, I won't rate it. That wouldn't be fair and I'm not here to hate read just for a trash review.

54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,Nicole,707,1732,3,"May 4, 2021","Was this fun?Extremely.Do I want to read the sequel ASAP?Oh yes.Was it perfect?Not by a long shot.I just finished reading this book and I’m thinking I read over 500 pages and what progress has been made since the total kickass From Blood and Ash? Not much. However, I read it fairly quickly and wasn’t bored at all. Nonetheless, it doesn't deserve 4 stars because it had its share of flaws. While they did not affect my enjoyment –most of the time- they certainly made me lower my rating. Sadly, I can't discuss this book without any spoilers for the first one. I’ll simply make a list of the pros and cons. I'm feeling too lazy to write comprehensible paragraphs.Cons: this won’t be a short list but I want to say that I liked this book in spite of these and I grew fond of the characters a lot.✏ Poppy’s violence. Oh, Poppy is so violent. It was so forced. She spent the whole book wanting to stab Cas or Kieran. And Cas saying he’s turned on by that. And it went on and on. Most characters –who don’t hate her- talk about her violence. Ok. We got it. Enough already.✏ Poppy’s questions.she's special because of this.✏ Poppy and Cas fighting their attraction. Not discussing their relationship. Cas taking too much time to explain his reasons for wanting to marry her –which of course was going to drive her crazy. ¼ of the book was spent on those two bickering or kissing. This isn't slow burn anymore this nonsense. Also, some adjectives were used too many times like “indecent” “intriguing” especially when JLA was trying for dirty talk between our MCs.✏ Another ¼ was spent on Poppy’s inner monologues. Which led to nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. Not ashamed to say I skimmed through those parts.✏ Barely any major event happened  I spent the first half wishing she doesn’t get captured and the other half wishing she does. we only had one minor event which promoted for the second big major event and then the last few pages. Yes, I enjoyed it anyway but when I finished the book and looked back, I realized the summary would be rather short for this amount of pages.✏ Poppy being all so special with special abilities, I’m sure this will be explained later but I felt that this book became too fantastical? Sure it is fantasy but the first book did not set up the world-building for this level of fantasy. Almost like whatever cool idea occurred to JLA she squeezed somewhere without giving much explanation.✏ I thought I was missing something but I read some other reviews that shared my opinion. We still had info-dumping. In a second book. I was confused a few times but lacked the energy to find what I’m missing so I carried on.✏ This book going to erotica books kind of places, sure I do appreciate some scenes but the Joining? Euh...✏ HEARTMATES AKA ANOTHER WORD FOR SOULMATES AKA MATES EXISTS IN THIS WORLD. WHY WHY WHY.What I liked:  which I’ll keep brief because of the 4.7 rating avg, most reviews are raving about this book.✏ I genuinely love Poppy and Casteel, even though they do not communicate enough in my opinion, not nearly enough, I like them as individuals. ✏ I also enjoyed the secondary set of characters, especially the wolven. Kieran, Netta, Jasper, etc. But I only wish we had less dialogue about Poppy's personality. Or simply fewer pages so the events that took place can be seen as more significant.✏ I’m very curious about how this story is going to continue, I can only guess part of it but because I wasn’t paying attention to all the info shower, I missed some stuff, so yeah no idea what is going to happen now but I am waiting for some heck of an explanation. A logical explanation might I add.✏ Did I mention the fun? I think I did but I need to emphasize how much I enjoyed reading this book (with its outdated title). It took me 7 days to finish because it was a very busy week but I was reading in most of my limited free time. Which is mostly before sleep. Which means I had to struggle to stop reading. I ended up sleeping after 2 am on workdays. Shortly, the strength of this book lays in its addicting quality and its characters even if their interactions weren’t the best all the time. If you enjoyed the first book, you’ll also enjoy this one too, although you most likely won't find it as good.",386,86

GET A FUCKING THERAPIST OH MY GOOOOOOOD. take a sit sarah j maas. this dynamic and trope is everything to me. everything. its my number 1 trope i love it to death. im honestly impressed this author managed to make me hate this so much. like that took effort of jla's part. it truly did. i applaud it. im gonna need a good villain/mc romance now to get over my frustration over my unmet wishes. or not read this dynamic for a very long time unless i know the writer knows what they're doing. anyway i hate this fucking book fuck this book FUCK THIS BOOK",374,49

So allow me to give you a breakdown of what is currently going on in my obsessed brain:✦ Am I too biased to even attempt to rate this objectively? Definitely.✦ Isn’t the rating ultimately about my thoughts and emotions and, besides, can’t it be said that if the issues did not obscure my enjoyment then they don’t truly matter to me anyhow? I believe so, yes.✦ And did I love this? Love? I am dead.✦ Did that love have everything to do with the romance and characters which are, in the end, the entire point of this paranormal-fantasy romance? Undoubtedly.✦ Were the characters and romance everything I, the aromantic dark-loving I, look for when picking up romance? Unequivocally✦ Are they particularly healthy? Not really.✦ Do I care? Not even a little bit.✦ Will you now be assaulted with me “level-headedly” gushing over this romance and trying to explain why it’s so special to me? You got it. *winky wink*To put it simply: if you, like me, crave from time to time a disarmingly seductive and feral new adult romance of enemies to lovers in an engagement of convenience, overflowing with deliciously addictive drama, delightfully humourous banter, easy-to-love side characters, and wickedly creative steam, a recurring theme of real or play-pretend deftly woven throughout its every thread, and want it to be unique and make you feel and cheer and bleed, A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire will provide even better than its predecessor, with a young woman who will never again be a passive pawn, a prince who is more mad than man, and a war of love where neither side is afraid to fight to steal a heart and keep their own.
  “Beauty, my sweet child, is often broken and barbed, and always unexpected.”
I’ll admit, this series feels like a mix of so many pieces plucked from other bestsellers, namely 
  Twilight
 and A Court of Mist and Fury, except it’s somehow not a bad reminder because the pieces are turned on their heads. Where Twilight had a problematically romanticised dynamic of a cat and a mouse, AKoFaF has two cats playing chase. Where ACoMaF was too sweetly romantic for me, AKoFaF does it more ferociously. Honestly, what is more captivating than two savage souls tearing into one another, taking pieces and denying that the other holds too many of theirs?Now to put it not simply:➸ 
  AKoFaF Vs. FBaA: Fave or Not?
Let’s let get the whining out of the way before I can get to the level-headed gushing. AKoFaF is, technically, better than FBaA. Which is only natural, as the tension is already there, the scale is grander, the world is vaster, it’s even smuttier (and I do not say this lightly because I was murdered), etcetera etcetera, you know how this goes. BUT, while I’m giving both books the same rating, while they are both predictable and I don’t mind, while both are not good at building mysteries in a way that it makes sense before unravelling, FBaA was a fave (an all-time fave) and AKoFaF was not. Why?✧ What made FBaA iconic is no longer there: It doesn’t matter that the first book was smaller in scale—bigger scale does not automatically equal a better book. And 
  From Blood and Ash
 did what it did just right, focusing on the iconic dynamic of a secret-warrior Maiden and her shameless flirt of a guard; but AKoFaF did not. With a bigger scale comes a bigger responsibility, and you just can’t take the same approach and unceremoniously dump it into a wholly different type of book. JLA did capture the grandness rather well at the very end, and she evidently stole my heart again. And yet.
Credit: Catherine Crowley
✧ Someone explain to me why people found FBaA to have a slow start and not AKoFaF: With FBaA, being stuck in a keep was understandable and expected; there was no urgency to move from the MC’s home. But in AKoFaF you turn every page waiting for them to get off your asses and move already. And yet they don’t. Don’t get me wrong, I loved all the small drama and the new enemies to lovers romance, but it needed to happen on the move dammit not in a keep no one cares about.✧ There is no conclusion what the fuck: I’m just gonna go ahead and question my and everyone else’s sanity who thinks this is a complete book. Spoiler alert, it’s not. Or maybe I just misplaced the last chapters where the build up and the mysteries raised through the entire book actually got even a semi answer. My bad. Please move on to my incessant gushing now.➸ 
  Romance: The Heart & Soul of It All

  “You’re beautiful when you’re quiet and somber, but when you laugh? You rival the sunrise over the Skotos Mountains.”
In all the vast, wild world, there are different kinds of relationships; there are cute partners who give each other sweet whispers and kisses, there are steely partners who provide peace in their steady embrace, and then there are playful partners whose very dynamic is a cat and mouse chase. All relationships have a little bit of the three, but yours magnanimously naughty soul gravitates, unsurprisingly, towards the ones with a dominant playful side. That’s why I live for Poppy and Cas.In all the aforementioned vast, wild world though, there are also different kinds of understanding; when we hear the word, don’t we usually think of sympathy for another’s pain, comradeship in compassion, or acceptance of different beliefs? Well, what about rage or hate? What about understanding one’s vengeance and seeking no sympathy? Understanding is, as a rule, crucial to us living side by side as varied humans, but yours raging truly gravitates, you guessed it, towards the latter the most. That is also why I live for Poppy and Cas.
  “Retribution is yours, if you want it,” he said. “And if not, I will be your blade, the thing that ends his miserable existence. It’s your choice.”
Readers keep comparing these two to Feysand from A Court of Mist and Fury and they need to stop. Stop this madness right this moment! Feyre and Rhysand are, as a rule, sweetness seeking people. Yes, they have their playful side, but the core of their relationship is being cute and adorable and romantic and whispering sweet nothings. That doesn’t make them any less of a great couple (I do love them), it just makes them less of a my type of couple. Whereas Poppy and Cas, despite occasionally being romantic and adorable and making declarations of love, operate on a bloodsport-type of dynamic (seriously, Raleigh Ritchie’s song Bloodsport exists for these two no kidding; you can find it on my playlist), baiting, circling one another, looking to draw first blood. It’s a constant, neverending challenge, a game of who will best whom, and it killed me and revived me and dug a den deep into my abandoned heart and no I’m not dramatic you’re dramatic.Their repeated scenarios of stabbing-threats and pretending-promises aren’t JLA being out of ideas (her banter and, obviously, drop-dead steamy scenes are signs of her creativity), what they are is an accurate, in-character core to their bond, the type of which you’d usually find in well-developed partnerships with too much history. What they are is a cycle: he teases, she brandishes dagger, he in enticed, she is enticed, so he teases, so she brandishes dagger, so he is enticed even more, and you know how it goes. That most likely sounds like a very dysfunctional romance, but to quote Cas, “You can’t spell dysfunctional without fun, now can you?” He wants a fight, she wants a fight, it’s a win-win. And them both being vengeful, ruthless creatures and experiencing a blooming development to embrace the other’s darker side is only a plus. Stop criticising them for not being a sane, boring, logical matching please and thank you.
  “By the way, I’m not yours,” I told him. “I don’t belong to anyone but myself. Nothing changes that.”“What if I just wanted a piece of you? A tiny piece that belonged to me? [...] Tell me what piece of you I can have. It can be any piece of your choosing. Whatever it is, I’ll take it.” His chin grazed my cheek. “It will be my most prized possession.”
Three further points to note in response to criticism of AKoFaF: ❶ the issues and possibly problematic aspects to their dynamic are not glossed over and instead acknowledged, ❷ he is clearly insane, and she wants him not as in the body-betrying kind but the I-want-you-even-as-I-hate-you, I-love-you-even-as-I-shouldn’t, and I-might-be-a-little-insane-too one, there is a difference, and ❸ even as Cas perpetually teases Poppy, he is not dismissing her and laughing at her but in delight of how she is serious about her threats, all because he loves the challenge she is.➸ 
  Casteel: I Will FiveEver Be Swooning

  “That was a temporary loss of sanity.”“That’s my favorite kind.”
You see, the reason I’m in love with Cas is not because he is devilishly charming, irresistibly handsome, and willfully princely (though that helps), neither is it because he is impossibly insufferable, unbelievably challenging, and endearingly ridiculous (though that came close); it’s because he is an unhinged, vicious, murderous tyrant next to all the above, having gone through horrors, changing, and then carrying out his own horrible acts, effectively earning the title of the Dark One (unlike SOME hero-or-villain supposedly dark YA love interests *cue eye roll*). Casteel is mad, but all the best people are.
Credit: Dominique Wesson
One of the main reasons for why AKoFaF slayed as it did was the delve into Cas’s character, deadly dark side and lonely vulnerable side all unleashed on the reader. I can only beg JLA to not ruin him in the sequel because finding a character I stan this much is rare and scary—too many times have authors chosen to step back from the madness, efficiently breaking my heart of ice. I still bear the bruises.➸ 
  Poppy: I Agree With Casteel on This One

  “Fearing what you’re capable of doesn’t mean I fear you.”
I know Cas has said it enough times but...she is rather violent, isn’t she. I realise that coming at things like a battering ram is not the best strategy (it’s actually one reason why Gryffindors, despite being a huge part of me, annoy me every now and then) but I, to put it simply, adore her. Maybe it’s because I relate to her impulsive randomness, maybe it’s due to how hilarious her living-to-snap way of life is (I would sacrifice anything for a good laugh—even you); or perhaps it’s based on her aching for freedom or how she remains clever and rather wise when she’s not overwhelmed by her emotions; mayhaps it has to do with her deserving the “badass female lead” description, her rashness pointed out as she proceeds to provide me with a queenly character development. I have no idea.What I do know is that Poppy spent too long trapped in silence as her future was chosen for her, her life discussed around her with only being on the recieving end of an order, and she will no longer wait to be rescued or controlled. I cheered with every breath in and every breath out for her to show them all that, “forcing a warrior to don a veil of submission was never going to last.”➸ 
  Kieran: A Moment of Appreciation, Please

  I turned to him. “Were you injured?”“Would you fret with worry if I was?”The corners of my lips turned down. No? Yes? “Not particularly.”“Ouch.” He pressed a hand to his chest. “You wound me yet again.”“He’s not wounded,” Kieran answered. “At least, not physically. Emotionally, I believe you left him shredded.”
This is naught but a short paragraph of me telling you of how thoroughly my baby Kieran snatched my heart with his semi-bored constant sarcasm, his growing friendship with Poppy rooted in his imparting of wisdom, and his precious bromance with Cas. Move along now.➸ 
  World Building: Do I Need To Rant Again?

  
Fortunately for you, the answer is no. Yes, there were still parts of the mythology that were poorly explained (e.g. everything that has to do with the deities and heartmates) but the missing glue creeped between the jumble of picked paranormal slash fantasy elements to turn the mismatched into a successful match, and the world expanded tenfold. So, you won’t hear me complaining. (I realise you just did, but shhhhh, go to sleep.)➸

54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,❀ Rose ❀,275,208,2,"October 29, 2021","2 starsOkk Judging by all the five star ratings that i’ve been seeing for this book, I’m honestly in the minority here but that’s ok. A lot of things hindered my enjoyment of this book so let me just get into them.🔹  Overall feelings: 〰 Oh my ever loving God who the hell allowed this book to be this long for no freaking reason? I liked some aspects of it but if you’re going to go into this book please know that this is, in every sense of the word, a  filler   book... and it  shows. 🔹  The pacing: 〰 Here’s the thing, a slow paced book doesn’t normally bother me that much and usually, if the plot is action packed, then I find that I actually prefer slower paced books as they help me have enough time to understand everything that’s happening. However, not only does nothing interesting or of import actually happen in this book, but the author shows you every single second of every single  hour  of every single  day  and I just couldn’t help but wonder...  why???? 🔹  The plot : 〰 Who? What? Where?When I tell you nothing of import actually happens... I mean it. Since we see every single second of the day, the whole book takes place over the span of what? A week? Maybe two? Mostly they’re on the road and trying to get to Atlantia but they literally only get to the city in the last 10 pages... which is why the only interesting event to happen in this entire book happens in the last 10 pages. And for a 600+ book, I don’t think that’s normal. Had this book been 300 pages shorter, i would have loved it. Hell, had it been 600 pages long but with real dialogue or at least a real plot, I also would have liked it. The entire plot of this book is:- Someone gets hurt, - Poppy heals them, - Everybody in town sees what she’s doing, - People are either afraid of her or in awe, - Someone tells her that she’s amazing, - Poppy blushes and says that’s she’s not. I kid you not, that’s the entire plot... kill me. Kill me now. But the repetitiveness of the plot leads me to my next point...🔹  The dialogue : Remember when I said that this book needed to be 300 pages shorter? Yeah, that could have easily happened if the repetitiveness in the dialogue had been dealt with and cut out. I kid you not, when I tell you that you absolutely have to hear about how ‘random’ Poppy’s questions are and how ‘intriguing’ Casteel finds her every.single.chapter. And it’s not like they use different words to describe these things. Oh no, they literally use the words “random” and “intriguing” every time which just made me want to...  *combust*. That’s not the only repetitive thing however. Every single time Poppy meets someone new, they have a discussion about how “violent” she is and how she stabbed Hawke when he betrayed her. This conversation legit happens every couple of chapters and at one point, it’s just like... I get it. I was actually there when it happened so I don’t need to reread the events over and over again. I get that she’s not  like other girls , I promise- (thankfully, no one actually uses this phrase in the book so thank God for small mercies I guess). 🔹  The characters: 〰   Hawke: I still liked him in this installment but some of the things he did just annoyed the living crap out of me. For one, we get that you like Poppy when she’s threatening you. I promise you that we get it. Secondly, the whole miscommunication and not telling your partner how you feel for so long just annoyed me. Finally, that scene at the end with the battle against the duchess and her army... the fact that he and Poppy legit stopped in the middle of the battle to kiss and have a whole ass conversation about how they need to get out (which, don’t even get me started about how he would have left his people to get massacred just to be able to get his wife out) just made me irritated with them... again. Also, are you kidding me with the scene in the duchess’s carriage?!? They’re literally STILL ON THE BATTLEFIELD  in the middle of THE FREAKING BATTLE . But oh well, to each their own I guess *shrugs*. 〰   Poppy: Biggest disappointment in this entire book for me. If you’ve read my review for the first book (which I loved) then you’ll remember that I absolutely ADORED Poppy and that I found her to be one the best female characters that I’ve read in a while because I thought that she was soo well balanced (I explain what I mean by that in my review of the first book). In this book however, it felt like Poppy went from being a three dimensional, well developed character to being someone with one personality trait... which was that she’s violent. Literally. Her threatening to stab or kill someone got old pretty fast and just made me wish that she would show the different facets of her personality just like she did in the first book. That didn’t happen however which left me feeling incredibly disappointed in her character arc. 〰   Side characters : I liked all of them. I don’t like Alistir but that’s ok since I think that the author actually wants us to be weary of him. Kieran i liked but the whole thing with him and the joining just made me uncomfortable. I would much rather him be an older brother figure to Poppy than anything else to be honest. 🔹  Final thoughts: 〰 I think that this book would have been much much better had we had the chance to see them in Atlantia (the part where Casteel’s parents live). I would have loved to see both main characters deal with the king and queen in this book instead of prolonging the inevitable meeting for so long. Most of this book takes place on the road and that just did not do it for me. Although I enjoyed some aspects of this installment, I think that this is a filler book in every sense of the word. I was also really disappointed when I learned that this was going to be a series instead of a trilogy because that’s usually how and why filler books are created... to prolong the journey for no damn reason instead of just getting to the point. That said, some things did amuse me and I did like some scenes so I do recommend reading this book if you enjoyed the first one. And since I seem to be in the minority here, then chances are you’re probably going to be enjoying this much more than I did!Happy reading.——————— Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/",270,59
54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,Lacey (laceybooklovers),"1,986",9742,4,"September 4, 2020","Ever since I finished From Blood and Ash, A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire shot up to the top of my most anticipated sequels of 2020. FBAA is one of my favorite books this year and the ending absolutely killed me. I NEEDED to read more of Poppy, Cas, and this epic fantasy world full of gods, magic, and vampires! Thankfully, this much-awaited sequel did not disappoint. I loved being back with our main characters, who have such great banter and chemistry together, and learning more about this new world Poppy is discovering.AKOFAF literally picks up right where FBAA left off, with the wildest proposal ever. Poppy is rightfully hurt and angry at Casteel for his lies and betrayal, so their relationship, or what’s left of it, is on thin ice. Now to add in a marriage? It’s crazy – but it just might work. They both have something at stake and will do anything, even marry each other, to reach their goals. And in the midst of this marriage of convenience(!), Poppy also has to deal with being an outsider and despised by the Atlantians for being the former Maiden.I was expecting a ton of angst and tension after what happened in FBAA and JLA dishes all of that out SO well. I was feeling so much for Poppy and Cas – they don’t want to want each other, but the lust and chemistry that developed while they were Poppy and Hawke is still there and only gets stronger the more time they spend together. JLA nails the push and pull of the romance, the longing, the heartache, and the love. Poppy and Casteel are both fantastic characters and there was never a time I didn’t root for them or want them to get their HEA. And I just gotta say, our vampire prince hero is even hotter this second time around! I loved him as Hawke but he’s way more compelling as Casteel.We do get much more of the world-building, as expected in a fantasy sequel. There isn’t as much action and the pacing of AKOFAF is definitely slower, as it focuses more on fleshing out this fantasy world and developing Poppy and Cas’s relationship. But one of the things I love about JLA is that her writing is so easy to read. I never felt like there was too much info-dumping and despite how much more detailed and in-depth we get into the Atlantian world, I never felt like I was lost reading it all.AKOFAF is a fantastic follow-up to one of my favorite reads of the year. Poppy is more of her badass self, the romance is steamyyy (I am HERE for all the hot fantasy romances!), and I just love this world JLA has created so much. If you thought the FBAA ending was awful (in the best way), prepare for AKOFAF’s! The cliffhanger will have you screaming!",247,27
54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,Lucie V.,978,1513,5,"June 13, 2022","Oh. My. God.  😍 This book is even better than the first one.*Long review ahead, #SorryNotSorry.✅ Strong main character ✅ Awesome love interest✅ Amazing secondary characters ✅ Hate/love and a lot of angst✅ Sexual tension and some sexy moments ✅ Funny and witty banter ✅ Action ✅ Pace and plot❗️❗️ Kind of cliffhanger ❗️❗️ Trigger warnings: violence, murder, and mention of cannibalism
  
    ""I am born of the first kingdom."" Casteel's voice carried like the wind and snow, stroking over the knights, who all turned, one by one, to look in his direction. ""Created from the blood and ash of all those who fell before me. I have risen to take back what is mine. I'm who you call the Dark One,"" he said, and chills danced across my skin. ""Yes, I have the Maiden, and I'm not giving her back.""
  
So many people told me that the second book was even better than the first one, and I was skeptical because I really enjoyed the first book, but they were right. The action, the love/hate, the angst, the plot twists... I can't find the words to explain how amazing this book is. It is the perfect mix of powerful main characters, great secondary characters (Kieran! 😍), funny banter, action scenes, political intrigue, and a slow-burning (and intense) love/hate relationship with a lot of sexual tension and steamy moments. 
""All you have is me. Let me be enough."" ❤️A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire picks up right where From Blood and Ash ends. Poppy and Cas have a few relationship issues to work out in this book and even though the steamy scenes and the tension between them are delightful to read, I was so desperate for them to realize that the other loved them back. It created a weird mix of excitement and frustration, but it made the book so enjoyable. Their game of pretending, their conversations, and Cas's inappropriate behavior delighted me, and their intensity and protectiveness made me feel weak in the knees a few times. I love them so much (I would let Casteel do whatever he wants to me, and I would thank him for it).Honestly, for a book that’s over 600 pages, the plot does not progress that much, but I don’t care. At all. Because the interactions between the characters are so funny, cute, angsty, and heartwarming at the same time. Because Poppy showed everyone once again that she is a strong badass fighter and that she is not a meek and demure maiden waiting to be saved. Because Kieran is an awesome secondary character and I enjoyed every single interaction he had with Poppy. Because there is action, and fighting, and because this is an AMAZING BOOK.
  
    “He was the first thing I’d ever truly chosen for myself.I chose him because he made me feel like I was something other than the Maiden, and he saw me when no one else ever really did. He made me feel alive. He valued me for who I am and didn’t try to control me.”
  
Poppy just realized that all she believed to be true about her kingdom, about the Atlantians, and about Hawke are lies, and she now has to come to terms with this stinging betrayal. She is hurt, confused, and angry (and stabby), and I loved how she remained strong through all of it, and also how she held onto her anger. She did not forgive Cas after 2 hours just because he apologized and showed his dimple. Poppy is brave and fearless at times, and her obsession with sharp objects and stabbing has become a running gag in the book, but it really made me laugh. 
  
    ""He has done things some might find unforgivable. Things that would haunt your sleep and leave you with nightmares long after you wake. He may hate being called the Dark One, but he has earned that name.’’ Kieran’s pale eyes meet mine as a shiver curled its way down my spine. ""But he’s the one thing in all the kingdoms that you, and only you, never have to fear.""
  
Cas is trying to find a way to protect Poppy, and what better way to do it than keeping her at his side as his soon-to-be wife. The relationship between Cas and poppy becomes more intense and even more complicated the longer they spend together. There is action, fights (verbal and physical), and sexy hot scenes, and I honestly couldn't put it down. I. Love. Casteel.  Cas is as amazingly awesome as he was in the first book. He is funny, sexy, caring, intoxicating, and so many more adjectives that I can't come up with at the moment (I might be a little obsessed). 
  
    “Make me feel incompetent and kill more than me, Princess.”
  
That. 🖤That one sentence shows how proud he is of the fact that she can defend herself, doesn't think she needs him to save her or protect her, and how he likes her fierce and violent side. 🖤
  
    We were only pretending.But this felt so very real.""Only on one condition,"" I said.""You have a condition now?""I nodded, my heart thundering. ""I don't want to pretend,"" I whispered. ""I'm Poppy and you're Casteel, and this is real. Can you agree to that?""His eyes drifted shut for a heartbeat, all the striking lines of his face were tense. ""Always,"" he whispered. ""Yes."" 
  
One thing that I truly ADORED in this book is the angst. I love it when there is angst in a relationship before the characters get their HEA (and I really hope they will get it). Poppy is slowly realizing that she fell in love with Hawke and with Cas, even though she tried to hate him. She is also convinced that he doesn’t really care about her, he just wants her to be in good health so he can use her to get his brother back. So here she is, stuck in this place with the man she loves, and she “knows” he does not love her back, but at the same time he is being sweet and charming and sexy so it hurts her even more because she falls in love a little more every day. Obviously, Cas is in love with her, but she’s oblivious to it, and he is also making a good job of hiding it behind his “Dark One” mask and careless smiles. The last 25% were so full of conflicted feelings and angst and I REALLY like that!
  
    ""I wasn't rocking that much!"" I denied, wiggling to put space between us.""I wouldn't advise that,' he said, voice gruff as his arm tightened.""Why?""""Squirm a few more inches lower, and I'm sure you'll find out.""
  
The sexual tension between Poppy and Casteel is *chef’s kiss*. They have 0 skills when it comes to clearly communicate with each other, but when it comes to hot and steamy moments charged with sexual tension, lust, and desire, they are 10/10.
  
    Wanting to know how these people knew what Kieran and Casteel were, I twisted at the waist.“You’re naked!”“I am,” Kieran replied.And he was.
  
‎Kieran is one of the best secondary characters ever. His deep bond with Casteel is amazing and his shy and budding friendship with Poppy makes me want to see more of him in the next book (I also have to say that 
  that one scene
 with Cas, Poppy, and Kieran made me realize that I would not be against some sexy moments between the three of them 🔥🔥🔥). I really love him. Delano is also a secondary character that I grew to love very much. He is less present in the book, but he made me smile too with his little comments about Poppy and Casteel, and he is one of the only Wolven who respected Poppy from the start and gave her a chance instead of immediately disliking her for her association with the Ascended.
  
    ""Please don't fight atop the horse,"" Delano called out. ""None of us wish to watch Setti trample either of you.""""Speak for yourself,"" came Kieran's droll voice.Casteel straightened ""Don't worry. Neither of us will fall. It was just a love tap.""""That did not look like a love tap,"" Naill commented.""That's because it was a very passionate one,"" Casteel replied.""You're about to get a love tap to your face."" ""It turns me on when you're armed with something sharp.""""There is something entirely wrong with you.""He came around to my front. ""But you like what's wrong with me.""
  
I love their snark and witty banter. Especially now that there is anger and angst mixed into it. The running gag of Poppy being violent and stabbing everyone was also funny and I adored how Kieran mastered the art of being sarcastic while appearing bored and emotionless. His interactions with Poppy always made me smile either because he was so obviously exasperated by her (but still like her way down deep inside), or because he was defending Cas and he was being so loyal to him.
  
    The man was suddenly lifted up and tossed aside like he was nothing more than a bag of small rocks. I had no idea where he landed. All I could do was stare at Casteel.He stood above me, his face splattered with dots of red.“You’re bleeding.”“You have three arrows sticking out of you.”“You’ve been injured. Where?” He knelt beside me, ignoring my somewhat unnecessary observation.“I’m fine.” I sat up, my eyes glued the arrow jutting from his stomach as I sheathed my dagger. “Does it hurt?”“What?”“The arrows.” I paused as he grasped my left arm, pushing the cloak aside. “The arrows that are sticking out of your body.”
  
A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire is full of action, violence, betrayal, twists and turns, and horrible truths, but it is also filled with fierce love and friendship, and perfect and delightfully intense sexy moments. This book is a rollercoaster of emotions. I laughed out loud many times, I was at the edge of my seat for most of the book and now that it is over I feel like crying because the final revelation with the cliffhanger ending is KILLING me.
  
    “I don’t want to pretend,” I whispered. “I’m Poppy and you’re Casteel, and this is real.”
  
 😭 I love them. 🖤Also, I have to say that I do not trust Alastir, I am sure he was the man talking to Poppy's father the night they were attacked... And even if he's not, I don't trust him and I don't like him. He was also clearly behind the attack at the very end of the book, and he probably also has something to do with the attack that killed Poppy’s parents.

It will answers some of the questions, but to no one's surprise will also leave you with a lot of questions and theories thanks to the mean cliffhanger. 
  Atlantia rose from blood and ash. We are no longer a fallen kindom. Not by any sense of the world. We haven't been for a very long time. We are a kindom of fire.
I was kind of afraid to start this book, because I thought I would be confused. I've read Book 1, From Blood & Ash this year and it should be fresh on my mind, but it's not, cause I've read a lot of other books since then and some details are kinda fuzzy. If you're like me and too lazy/don't have time/or for whatever reason to reread From Blood & Ash, let me assure you: A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire gives a good summary or rather brings up important plotpoints that will remind you of the previous book.  What turned out surprisingly  well was the pacing. While it took me a while to get into the first book due to all the world building, A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire was better paced from the beginning til the end. It had a good balance of actions, fight scenes, dialogue, world building etc. Not to say that there weren't parts that were dragging, but it was way easier to get into the story. 
  Feelings were not stagnant. Neither were opinions or beliefs, and if we stopped believing people were capable of change, then the world might as well be left to burn.
 I'd love to tell you something about the plot but I'm shit with plot summaries so I'm just going to ramble about the characters and the romance, cause let's be honest that's what I'm most interested in.   ↳ ✧ 
  Penellaphe 'Poppy' Balfour
 ✧ Poppy is a badass character, but then all females in fantasy series seem to be super badass. It's nothing special and it's not like it hasn't been done before. It's sounds very negative, but I don't mean it in a bad way. It is what it is and that's okay. Despite that trope being overused I still love Poppy so much. Poppy is the girl that has been hidden from the world since her birth, groomed by the society and the queen she lived in to behave, be quiet and do what she's told. AKOFAF is the continuance of her character development into the real Poppy. The character development was so good. In this book Poppy learns a lot more about her powers that are evolving and her role in all of it. Let's not start about her abilities with a knife, sword or bow. We stan a  ✧ queen ✧ or should I say ✧ princess ✧  who can cut up her enemies like a fine steak. 🔪 
  “I bet you’re one of those wolven bitches. Hear they like their women all cut up.” He made a calling sound, one used to summon a dog, and my grip tightened. “Tell me, girl. What kind of bitch are you?” He lifted the club again, and I made my move. Shooting forward, I slipped under his arm and grabbed the dirty tunic. Thrusting the dagger up, I used every ounce of strength I had to drive it deep under his chin. “I’m this kind of bitch,” I growled. The muscles under the mask pieced together by human flesh went lax as I jerked the knife free.
It will be interesting to see how Poppy is going to deal with what happened at the end.   ↳ ✧ 
  Casteel 'Hawke'thorne Da'Neer
 ✧I love you and I will love you until the end of time.  Casteel also known as Hawke in From Blood and Ash, but I'm going to just call him Cas because I like that name better lol. Cas has built a name for himself as the 'Dark One' but honestly the only dark thing about him is his hair. Otherwise he is ✧ babyyy ✧ He is a tortured soul that is still dealing with his past. Cas is putting on his charm infront of his people and trying to so hard to be enough without knowing that he is enough. Everything he does, he does it fiercely. The prince of Atlantia does not play when it comes to Poppy. The things he says to her I don't know but it just wants to make me cry. Cas has some swoonworthy things to say i'm telling y'all!! 
  ""I need to feel your lips on mine."" He planted his hands on the carriage wall, caging me in. ""I need to feel your breath in my lungs. I need to feel your life inside me. I just need you. It's an ache. This need. Can I have you? All of you? 
While Cas background was very wishy-washy in the previous book for a reason, I enjoyed learning more about his past and his family in AKOFAF. I was soaking all the information about what shaped him into the man he is now like sponge in heat. It's giving his character more dimension with rough edges, cause he's more than just a pretty face.  ↳ ✧ 
  Kieran I-forgot-his-last-name
 ✧Jennifer L. Armentrout has the talent to write the best secondary characters. Kieran is no exception. JLA uses the same formula for all of her side characters: sprinkles a bit of sarcasm here, a little arrogance there, insert a definition of loyal and supportive friend and BOOM you'll have JLA side characters. BUT 👏. IT 👏. WORKS 👏. EVERY 👏. TIME 👏.  Having said that, I looooved what Kieran brought to the story. Kieran and Cas bromance is one of my favorite things in this book. Their bond is so strong and only death can pull them apart. His brother from another mother. Also Poppy and Kieran's growing friendship was hilarious. They reminded me of two siblings who annoy each other daily but also care about them a lot. Honestly their interactions with each other is sooo funny!!  
  ""He is not wounded,"" Kieran answered. ""At least, not physically. Emotinoally, I believe you left him shredded.""I rolled my eyes. ""Then why ask if he's okay if he's not hurt?"" Kieran started to reply, but Casteel beat him to it. ""He's a worrywart. Constantly fearing that I've been injured or that I've overexerted myself. Wanting to know if I've gotten eight hours of rest and eaten three square meals a day.""""Yeah, that's exactly it,"" Kieran replied drolly.

  I reacted without thought, slamming my elbow into his stomach. Casteel grunted out a curse. “Please don’t fight atop the horse,” Delano called out from somewhere behind us. “None of us wish to watch Setti trample either of you.”“Speak for yourself,” came Kieran’s droll voice. Casteel straightened behind me. “Don’t worry. Neither of us will fall. It was just a love tap.”“That did not look like a love tap,” Naill commented. “That’s because it was a very passionate one,” Casteel replied. “You’re about to get a love tap to your face,” I muttered under my breath. Casteel curled his arm more firmly around my waist as he laughed. 
If something happens to Kieran in the next two books, I'm ready to hail fire on y'all.  ↳ ✧ 
  The romance
 ✧
  ""No."" His forehead dropped to mine. ""There is one mor thing I need. Something that I've needed for days. Weeks. Months. Maybe forever."" The bridge of his nose brushed mine. ""But I know you won't allow it. Not like this.""The pounding in my chest moved lower. ""What…what have you needed for so long?""""You.""
 Oh my goooddd. THE ANGST guys the angst!! Fake dating or in this case fake engagement is always bringing a certain level of angst with it and I was here for it. Poppy and Cas having to fake that they are in love infront of everyone is doing things to my heart. The uncertainty for the characters if what was said/done is pretend or real? All the kisses, touches, stares… Give me all the longing!! That really tugged on my heartstrings.   Poppy and Cas relationship ended on a rocky note in the first book, in this book Poppy starting to learn again that maybe not everything was a lie. Their dynamic is interesting… Poppy's love for sharp objects and Cas' kink to be turned on by it. That's some entertainment right there. While their banter greatly entertained me, sometimes Poppy's stabbing tendencies were repetitively mentioned. It was maybe a bit too much.  But, the honesty between and Casteel and Poppy is a sight to behold. I mean after a betrayal the only way from there is up. The truth is out. The cards are open. Communication is key and Poppy and Cas do that. Whenever Poppy asked a question no matter how hard hitting it is, Casteel answered her honestly. 
  ""Always,"" he whispered in the breath we shared. ""Your heart was always safe with me. It always will be. There is nothing I will protect more fiercely or with more devotion, Poppy. Trust in that–in what you feel from me. In me.""
These two are so cute together.. So many heart eyes!! 😍😍😍 Casteel and Poppy are slowly making their way into my top JLA couples. #1 is always going to stay Daemon Black and Katy Swartz, because they're ✧ royalty ✧ and no one can change my mind.  Anyway, i'm excited for what next to come. Hoping for a spring release with how fast JLA is writing *fingers crossed*

54319549,A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire,danerys,448,190,1,"December 24, 2021","Are yall ready for a rant review? Because I have a lot to say. I have been planning this review pretty much the entire time I’ve been reading this book, it’s the only thing that kept me sane. I... I don’t even know where to start in terms of AKOFAF. AKOFAF. Hmm. That sounds a little familiar. Where have I heard it before? Oh, right. ACOMAF. Those sound suspiciously similar, and if I’m being 100% honest, this is kind of (very much) an ACOTAR rip off. I mean, yeah, the plot and shit isn’t the same, but some scenes and certain dialogue and things like heartmates you can tell are taken right out of that series. JLA must’ve read it right before writing this book lmao. So that was just Complaint #1. Would you like to hear the others?꧁The Plot꧂Well.... what plot? What plot, exactly, are we talking about here? Cuz I don’t see shit. Unless you mean info dumps and vague world-building and unnecessary sex scenes in the middle of battle and Casteel talking about Poppy being violent and stabbing people and Poppy being ✨curious✨and ✨nOt LiKE oTHeR GiRLs.✨ If you’re talking about that, then yeah, sure, there’s a plot. But other than that? Nope. Nothing happens. Nothing ever fucking happens, except for at the ending, which I’m starting to think is JLA’s way of making sure people continue reading her shitty series. I said what I said. This entire book is pretty much Poppy and Casteel and Kieran s l o w l y making their way to Atlantia. Of course, they only get there at the very end, and in the meantime, all their is is people talking about how ✨speshul✨ Poppy is, random battles, and Poppy and Casteel having Communication Issues™️ AND cringey dialogue. Let’s not forget about the cringey dialogue. I swear, (and I’ll go back and check,) these characters have the exact same conversation multiple times. And they’re not dialogue you want to be hearing many times, either. Believe me when I say it’s cringey as fuck. It all consists of lines like:❥“..... intruiging....“ many times from everyone❥“...so violent and it turns me on...“ from casteel❥“...poppy...stab someone again...“ from everyone❥“there’s something wrong with you.“ from poppy❥“i bet you do.“ from poppyAnd many, many more, though I don’t really care to name them all because it makes me want to gouge my eyes out. And I think you guys get the point. As another reviewer said, this is a filler book, and it shows.꧁The Characters꧂Poppy:So, in my review for the first book, I said that I didn’t find poppy annoying or whiny. Well, now I’m taking that back. She is both of those things. Before I get into the specifics, let’s start basic here. Her name is Penellaphe. Penellaphe. What kind of name is that?! I feel bad for her lmao. So yeah, even her name is bad. Ech. Now, for her personality. Oh, wait. What personality? As far as I can tell, the only personality traits Poppy has are being ✨violent✨, wanting to stab people, being ✨cURiOUs✨ and asking questions. Also being sheltered and not knowing anything about anything. So of course she’s going to ask questions. That’s not a personality trait, that’s not something to be praised for. If you have been sheltered your whole life, of course you are going to have questions about things. That’s just common sense. Casteel and Kieran and everyone else act like Poppy’s so ✨sPEshUL✨ and ✨nOt LiKE OtHER giRLS✨ because she asks questions, and honestly it’s fucking annoying. Back to the girl herself. I’m pretty sure she has the exact same thought process about 109 times in this book. Maybe more. The point is, it gets us absolutely nowhere. At the end of the first book, she admits that she is in love with Casteel. Halfway through this book, she comes to the conclusion that she might care for him beyond sexual attraction. W H A T ? I don’t get it. I don’t understand. Haven’t you come to that conclusion 20 million times before? I’m done, you guys. I’m so done. Casteel:So, I liked him as Hawke in the first book. I got annoyed with him at the end, because he was making me angry and ✨uncomfy✨, but i just assumed that oh, it’s fine, I’ll just fall in love with him over again in the second book. Well, no. Thats not what happened. If anything, Cas gets even more annoying in this book. All he ever thinks about and all he ever talks about is how amazing Poppy is and how whenever she’s violent it turns him on. Thats his entire personality, right there. Also, the author tries to make him so perfect. She tries to make him treat poppy ✨so well✨, believe in all the right things, and yet also be ✨bad✨ and ✨morally grey.✨ Well, i hate to tell you, JLA, but this is not how you write a good morally grey character. She just makes him confusing. Even poppy admits it at one point in the book, that Casteel is unpredictable and we never know how he’s gonna act. Actually, I disagree with that. I can predict how he is going to act, because he acts the exact same way each time we see him. But, each time we see him, the way he acts is confusing. It doesn’t make any sense, I know, but that’s exactly my point. Casteel doesn’t make any sense. Essentially he’s just an always horny, more annoying, cheap copycat version of Rhys from acotar. Yes, I said what I said. Kieran:Yay, I can finally talk about something I actually liked. Someone. I rated this book 1.5 stars, which means there was maybe one thing I liked about the book. Here is that thing. Right here. Kieran. K I E R A N. Yeah, he’s not the most original, and yeah, he’s not the most complex character ever, but he’s the best. He’s just the best, that’s my only explanation. I actually think the main reason for me liking him so much is that he, too, has to put up with Cas and Poppy 24/7. I relate to that. I relate to that a lot. He also just makes every situation better because he’s the only character who’s actually funny, and on occasion he makes fun of the two main characters, which is just the best fucking thing. So yeah. We stan Kieran in this house, and that’s about it.(Yes, there were other characters, but they’re not important enough to mention, so I’m just gong to skip over them and pretend that they don’t exist because I wasn’t paying attention to them anyways.)꧁The romance꧂Cas and Poppy:See, the thing is, I actually liked their romance in the first book. I’ve thought about why I liked it, and I’ve come to the conclusion that it was because of the trust. You cannot have a good, healthy relationship if there is no trust. That was not a problem for the first book. Poppy and Hawke trusted each other just fine. They were cute, they were sweet, there wasn’t really anything wrong with them. And then. And then. Hawke betrayed Poppy and became Casteel, Poppy was angry but still liked him, they had angry sex, blah blah blah. But all that trust that was there before? Gone. The author tries to bring it back in this book, by telling us over and over that Poppy trusts Cas and vice versa, but it just isn’t there. Yeah, they have pretty good sexual tension, and their smut scenes are fine, but other than that? I don’t see much. They can barely even admit that they love each other in their own minds, much less saying it out loud. They’re in constant denial of their feelings, and the whole will-they-won’t-they thing is annoying as fuck. Also, Communication Issues™️. There are so many communication issues it aint even funny. Poppy and Cas can’t tell each other anything. The closest they come to telling each other something along the lines of “I love you” is Cas complimenting Poppy and Poppy blushing and changing the subject. Occasionally there will be some cheesy line from Poppy that doesn’t make much sense, but that’s about it. It’s kinda sad cuz I was rooting for these two in the beginning, but things change ig ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.The Joining:I feel like y’all would want to know how I felt about this, so I gave it it’s own section. It’s gonna be a pretty short section, but still. So. On one hand, I do think the joining is a little weird and I’m not really sure what the purpose of it is.... for what, JLA? What’s the reason? I don’t really understand, it doesn’t seem necessary to the plot or the character development or even the romance, for that matter. But. On the other hand, I’m all for it, and I’m not really sure why Poppy keeps complaining about it. She gets to sleep with two super-hot guys? (Just ignoring the fact that they’re gonna do some cannibalistic shit too.) She’s lucky asf. Also, we need some more Kieran in our lives. Kieran is the best thing ever, so I think that’s the overwhelming reason why I generally would like the joining to happen. Bring it on lmaooo.꧁The writing꧂So it pretty much just tries to be SJM’s writing. Some of the phrases JLA uses are taken right from acomaf, and it’s honestly pretty obvious. The rest of the writing isn’t generally bad; there were some phrases that were good.... but there were most definitely things that were cringey asf, as I’ve said before. Mainly the dialogue, as I’ve also said before. I don’t really want to go over that again though because I don’t want to relive the discomfort lmao. So I don’t really have much else to say, except for that this isn’t a well-written book by a long shot, but I have most definitely read worse. It’s no doubt written better than most Wattpads and fanfics, which I always take as a good sign. That’s about it lmao, I know this is probably the shortest section yet. (What does it say about me that my section on the joining was longer than my section on the writing. 💀) ꧁Wrap-up꧂Okkkk, so that’s pretty much it for my review, I hope y’all enjoyed. Rant reviews are so much fun lmao. Bye now, thanks for reading if you made it all the way to the end that’s impressive asf, now go and read the book that you know you should be reading rn but aren’t. (Ik cuz I do that too ehehe.)",191,44

  Review [Sept. 14, 2020]:

  “I don’t want to pretend,” I whispered. “I’m Poppy and you’re Casteel, and this is real.”
Can you hear me crying? That's also real.This book was too beautiful.🥺AKOFAF is definitely one of the best books of 2020 imo and my favourite from JLA.I didn't even think it was possible to love JLA more than I already do, but it is. 🔥THIS QUEEN🔥How does she do it?!?! Casteel, Poppy, and Kieran have got to be my favourite characters from all of her books. The banter between them all and just....everything.🤧 Awww now I feel like crying even though there's no reason to. JLA is simply just amazing.
  🛑WARNING: SPOILERS FROM FB&A BELOW!!!🛑

  A Kingdom of Flesh and Fire
 picks up literally right after Casteel Da’Neer aka The Dark One aka the Prince of Atlantia aka Hawke Flynn (so many different names) declares to all about his plans to marry the once-Maiden, Poppy Balfour. Well, you can guess how that went with Poppy...She definitely wanted to stab someone i would too honestly And so it began: The battle between Poppy & Casteel.🔥⚔️
  “I was the Maiden, nearly groomed my entire life to remain pure and focused only on my Ascension. I was Chosen to be given to the gods, even though I never chose the life. I didn’t get to choose what I ate, when I left my chambers, or who was allowed to even touch me."" ""But he was the first thing I’d ever truly chosen for myself.”
Poppy has got to be one of my all time favourite MCs. I love this girl so much sdfsfs she's such a strong and witty female protagonist. Finally, after being subjected to a life of no choices and silence, Poppy can now be herself and speak out to those who insult her. And being declared as the fiancé of the Prince of Atlantia—well, of course she's going to have a lot of enemies and hatred directed towards her.Even so, she speaks her mind and refuses to let anyone put her down or scorn her. Her curiosity also never ceases to amaze me ahaha omg I love that all the questions she asks annoys Kieran endlessly. Their bantering is just too good.
  “Do you think he’ll believe us?”“Yet another question?” Kieran leaned back, crossing his arms. “Seriously? Do you ever get tired of asking so many?”“Apparently, you don’t, since you just asked three of them.”
And though she used to feel a self-conscious of her scars, now Poppy stands proud and looks straight into peoples' eyes without absolute fear of what they'll think of her. I love this girl sm.
  “Somewhere along the way, I no longer saw her as a bargaining chip or a tool for revenge. I saw her for who she was. Who she is—this beautiful, strong, intelligent, endlessly curious and kind woman who was as much a victim of the Ascended as any Atlantians.""""I fell in love with her, probably long before I even realized I had.”
omg how could anyone 
  not
 fall in love with Casteel?!?! Even after all the lies and betrayals, you could understand where he was coming from. He wanted so badly to save his brother, Malik, from the Ascended and was planning on using Poppy to get to him, but all that changed from the very moment he met her. Instead of going through with that, he completely changed all his plans just to find a way to be with her.🥺 ohmygod I cant-And then there's Casteel's fierce protectiveness over Poppy. I love how even though he worries and tries to convince Poppy from taking huge risks, he doesn't actually stop her. He respects Poppy's decision and ability to do what is necessary. He's always taking care of her, too.
  “Fight me. Argue with me. I won’t stop you. But I will not allow you to put your life in jeopardy.""
And don't forget those 
  dimples
 as Poppy loves to point out.😏
  “He was Casteel then just like he’s Hawke now,” Kieran stated quietly, drawing my gaze to him. “And you know that. You just aren’t ready to accept it.”
KIERAN CONTOU, MY LOVE. He's literally like the wingman and barrier between Casteel and Poppy for majority of the book. He had to deal with being in between the heat of Casteel and Poppy's arguments and conversations. You have to admire him for all that ahhh I probably love him the most. He knocked some sense into Poppy, that's for sure. ahaha and the conversations the 3 of them had omg
  “I’m curious,” Casteel said, causing me to jump. I hadn’t even heard him approach. “What are you two discussing that has Poppy looking as if she’s five seconds away from crawling under the table?”“Nothing,” I said.“I was just telling her about how you have heightened physical senses,” Kieran answered at the same time as I did. “Like your ability to see better than her, and scent her arousal—”“Oh, my gods!” I spun on the bench, swinging at Kieran, but he easily avoided my fist.“I’m sorry.” Kieran didn’t look remotely remorseful. “I meant desire. She doesn’t like the word arousal.”
Poppy hating on the word arousal ahaha I can't. She was so embarrassed omg. Casteel, Poppy, & Kieran are definitely at their best when they're together.😌And then of course, there were appearances of both new and old characters👀 Some wolven, Atlantian, Descenters, and Ascended. Declan, a wolven, was placed on guard duty a few times and his responses to Poppy demanding to be let out were just too good omg.
  “No one wishes to chase you through a snowstorm.”“I’d rather not be gutted by the Prince, so no.”“The Prince will return soon.”My favorite was when I’d said that I just wanted some fresh air. “Nothing personal, but there is literally no way I would trust you enough to crack this door open to allow even an inch of fresh air to enter your chamber.”
Someone's learned their lesson from the last time they were on guard duty with her *wheezing*Then there's Alastir.... I'm a little conflicted about him hmmm I do love him for being such a kind wolven to Poppy, but certain events have left me wondering some things. Still, he'd only met Poppy yet he was already offering to help her. So kind.🥺
  “So, that is why I’m offering you my aid. If you are being forced into this, I will help you escape. I will do everything in my power to ensure safe passage.""""But I will make sure you are somewhere neither the Ascended nor Casteel can ever reach you. All you have to do is tell me, and this will be over for you.""
Ohmygod wait--I just realized something. I have a theory ~ So I'm a little suspicious of Alastir after what happened at the end of AKOFAF, with those who were trying to kill Poppy, knowing about her empath abilities. It's most likely Alastir, but now I'm thinking....With that quote above, what if when he said he'd ensure safe passage where nobody would be able to find her—what if he was planning on killing her?? Then neither Casteel or the Ascended would be able to reach her.haha okay maybe I'm reading too much into this, but...it could be a possibility. definitely sus though.I must, before I end this, put in those moments with Poppy threatening the life of others.😌 Mostly just Casteel and Kieran.
  He chuckled. “Careful, Kieran,” Casteel murmured, catching my hand before I could swing at Kieran once more. “She’ll be threatening to stab you next.”The wolven grinned. “I’m pretty sure that’s already happened.”“I hate you,” I announced. “I hate you both.”
Poppy loves them so much--so sweet🥺
  “Obviously, Casteel takes after his father when it comes to women with sharp objects,” Jasper commented with a snort. “I feel like I’m missing some vital information that Delano conveniently left out when he met me halfway.”I frowned, but at least I knew where Delano had been.“You stabbed Casteel?” Jasper repeated. “In the heart? With bloodstone. And you thought it would kill him?”“In my defense, I felt bad afterward.”“She did cry,” Casteel remarked.I was going to stab him again.
Poppy's murderous intentions and violence is too funny, especially when she's around others who bear witness to it. I so need more of that.😂👏👏okay but after 
  that
 ending the 3rd book has definitely landed into my most anticipated releases for 2021. sdfdsds I can't wait!!! I NEED THE NEXT BOOK NOW. *sobbing*I just love JLA so much. You can really tell how much her writing has changed from her first few books. Truly just a queen <3Hopefully, the latest the 3rd book comes out will be spring 2021. I don't think I can bear waiting a full year or more....
