57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,Val ⚓️ Shameless Handmaiden ⚓️,"1,794",27800,5,"April 4, 2021","4.5 StarsLike many MZ fans, I was neurotically checking amazon virtually everyday awaiting this book release. Color me happy when it popped up yesterday. And, luckily enough, I was enjoying a lazy day and had all the time in the world to read it. Which I did in one sitting. This was just exactly what I was in the mood for. Like all MZ books, it was super slow burn with a somewhat meandering plot...a lot of the characters and tensions were very MZ formula, i.e., Van had her marathons and fucked up family and Aurora had huge hikes and a previously fucked up relationship. In fact, Van/Sal and Aurora felt very similar to me in a way that a lot of MZ's main characters do...Rhodes was very Aiden/Renier with his grumpiness...But you know what? I don't even care. Because I like MZ's lead characters. They are usually good guileless people with good hearts and interesting backgrounds and I enjoy that you have to work a little bit to get to know them, even if they all are a little similar. I enjoy the way she writes...the details and the nuance...the way things are slowly revealed to the reader in small chunks. And this book was no different. Did I love it as much as Winnipeg and Kulti? No. Because those books are like unicorns, folks, and I accept that. And I've learned that picking up an MZ book with lighting strike expectations only leads to disappointment. That said, I went into this book expecting to really enjoy it and I did. However, to be blunt: If you are over the formula, the character interchangeability and the slow burn, you might not like this book. But if you don't mind, you will find this to be an enjoyable read.",715,79
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,mel ☽,365,6532,4,"April 13, 2021","3.75-4 stars ✩⋆this book really made me wanna get out of my bed, stop reading till 4 am, and instead wake up at 4 am, go on 5 hour hikes, go camping and generally just go outside... ... but am i gonna do all this?there's just something so peaceful about the outdoors and small town in fiction. like, it just makes me feel so comfy, just- soo at peace, ya know? i don't know why. is it maybe because it reminds me of twilight aka one of my comfort movies? yes, of fucking course. and the fact that this book has found family/home trope, small town, a dilf and his cute adorable teenage kid, slowburn (no, like, this is VERY slowburn guys), grumpy/sunshine trope? just- I M M A C U L A T E.  but anyways a little backstory, ⤷ this book is about Aurora De La Torre (h) who just got dumped recently by her famous dickhead boyfriend. a year later, she decides to move back to her childhood home and do many of the things her mother used to do. and lo and behold, her landlord, Tobias Rhodes (H), at the new place she was staying at? yeah, he didn't want her there because his son, Amos secretly allowed her to rent their garage apartment. but as y'all know, sunshine characters always win over the grumpy assholes over time.this gave me KA vibes, mainly the gamble and sweet dreams and the feelings i felt while reading this were close to what i felt when i read my favorite MZ books (kulti, wall of winnipeg and wait for it) so if you like any of these, im pretty sure you'll like this book. ➳ 
  characters
aight let's talk about Aurora first kay? yeah, i love this bish. i really do. she reminds me of Diana with a little bit of Sal mainly because they all annoy the grumpy H's all the damn time with their sunshine, optimistic personality which i love to see in MZ heroines. i just love reading about her journey when it comes to grief, honoring her mom, and just overall realizing that the ""love"" she had was shit and she now knows what she👏fucking👏deserves👏. we love to see it. whenever she doesn't wish happiness for her ex and her ex's mother- ugh my petty self was delighted af because look at this:
  ""I wish that I could tell you that I hope you'll both find peace and happiness in your lives, but I'm not that good of a person. What I hope for is that you'll leave me alone... If I see you or Kaden again, I'll make sure you regret it.""
i-i know forgiveness is apparently the best thing ever but is it really? do the wrongdoers really deserve our forgiveness? nah bish i don't think so. and now let's talk about the dilf to end all dilfs. how do i feel about Rhodes.. hm.. let's just say, non-fictional men could NEVERRR!!!. would a non-fictional man really build a tent for you because your camping trip was cancelled so he did all this just so he could see you smile again? would they? WOULD THEY? yeah, i don't think so. though, even if i love this man, just like in hands down, i still felt more connected with the heroine more than the Hero but i'll talk about this later.➳ 
  romance
this was SLOW slow, holy fuck. listen, i'm used to MZ slow but this is even slower than the usual MZ's slow slowburn, you know what i mean? they finally touched each other's hands at around 58%. that's how slow this is.although this was slower than usual, this was also kind of the fastest. and what i mean by that is they did NOT have sex in the very last chapter which is unusual for an MZ book aaand we actually got to see them as a couple!! for those who haven't read MZ, y'all should know this shit is rare. this never happens. and i'm pretty sure Rhodes and Aurora are the MCs who hugged each other the most compared to other MZ characters and i know this because they're hugging each other all the damn time in the last half. but anyways, although this book is slower than usual, we all know MZ is all about the slowburn so whenever there are little things like light touches, heated stares, calling the heroine beautiful, which are bound to be ordinary in romance novels standards, it is literally the equivalent to sex in normal romance novels. i get so excited when they would brush each other's shoulders because yes, sexual tension is superior to sex itself.➳ 
  ugly crying in the last 10ish% (spoilers)
so i've been watching a show recently and a quote stuck out to me:✧ WandaVision(yes, this is from that marvel show)↳ ""What is grief, if not love persevering?""
THIS. this is the one. this fucking quote is basically what this book and Aurora's journey is about dont @ me on this. i- okay. to be honest with y'all i literally cried, um, particularly hard reading the last 10% when they found her mother's body and she had to go through grief all over again because i felt this as i recently lost someone close to me so of course i'm gonna ugly cry. i guess reading about a character grieving and being thankful of her loved ones was nice to read about.
  ""Grief was the final way we had to tell our loved ones that they’d impacted our lives. That we missed them so, so much... I had to live, but I could also remember along the way. The people we lose take a part of us with them… but they leave a part of themselves with us too.”
hahaha i'm okay- SO okay. and even though a lot of shit happened to Aurora (losing her mom, getting dumped and kicked out by her ex and was treated like shit for 14 years), she still had a positive, optimistic personality because she focuses on the good in her life and how she's thankful about all the people who genuinely love her and doesn't take her for granted. ugh IT'S CUTE OKAY.➳ 
  ex drama (spoilers)
for those who want to know the tea, there's a tiny bit of ex/OM drama. Aurora and her ex, Kaden, were together for 14 years and she thought she loved him but found out that she just wanted to love and be loved, etc. and she's 100% over him. there's not much drama honestly. he and his mom just show up at the end to beg her to come back to him but obviously she was like hell no. there's no OW drama. we find out that Rhodes does not have a baby mama, he's a donor for his best friend and his wife. ➳ 
  why not a higher rating?
although i loved Rhodes and am currently manifesting for a guy like him as of this moment, i felt like he was more of a side character at times. his character depth was nothing compared to Aurora and i guess that's bound to happen because this book is only written in her pov. it also doesn't help that he barely showed up in the first half and every characterization of him was basically kind of rushed in the last half and most of his background told >>> shown which again, makes his character depth inferior in comparison to Aurora.and when it came to the nicknames and Rhodes was all like ""ANGEL"", i was all like,hmm. okay, okay. it's cute. and ya know, i was traumatized from that ""kiddo"" incident and i'm grateful that Rhodes actually called her something sweet and not something that feels weird and illegal because- ""B U D D Y""no. NOO. NOOOO.take this back. pls for the love of all that is holy and spiritual, take this THE F back. i know he calls her ""buddy"" because of buddy the elf but nooOOoo. this gave me father-son vibes. it's weird, it feels... inCesTuOuS. take this back!! we cannot go back to ""kiddo"" days!! we cannot validate freud's theories he can't keep getting away with this!!･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･･ﾟﾟ･｡｡･ﾟﾟ･．this book is very sweet and wholesome, it focused more on the characters which i actually like because yes, i'm more of a character >>> plot type of girl. i loved all the characters and even though the romance is slow as hell, if you like Aurora, then you wouldn't mind reading about her journey/character development, which is the majority of this book.i think i died a little bit when i saw that Reiner Kulti easter egg because OHMYFUCKINGGODITSKULTI!!!. and y'all, i looked up what Pagosa Springs look like because i'm nosy and i wanna know if it's real (it is) and it's so?? pretty?? i wanna go! someone take me with them please. but yeah, anyone make a petition for Yuki and her bodyguard to have their own story yet?",503,50
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,Kat,256,78600,3,"November 13, 2022","First Mariana Zapata and WOW, WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER. Tobias Rhodes!!!! LISTENNN, never have I ever been a fan of the single dad trope in my life; he might have swayed me though!! This man owns all ten of my toes. I'd commit a light felony if I thought it meant he'd crack a smile. His hands are so big and warm and I wanna fall asleep in them like Thumbelina. Not to mention, the ""who did this to you?"" scene, the post-hike first aid moment, the thunderstorm rescue??? I'm a hurt/comfort girlie forever and ever, through and through. The sluttiest thing a man can do is care, and Rhodes? He was downright INDECENT.However, I am nothing if not a hater to my core, so let's cut to the critiques: The main conclusion I drew while reading All Rhodes Lead Here is that Zapata’s hallmark—the length of her novels—might also be indicative of her greatest weakness. The slow burn was not the problem, nothing about the build between Rhodes and Aurora needed to be fully cut. It was the combo of repetitive, wordy writing with the glacial pacing that made me really FEEL each of those 559 pages. Like…please...someone free this woman from her periphrasis cage; let her know that names + pronouns are allowed to be used more than once per paragraph. Also, Not every one-liner needs to be turned into a running bit and sometimes 'cute' nicknames should remain unexplained, especially those that exist because one character reminds the other of Will Ferrell running around New York City like a hyperactive toddler in tights.But, despite my shit talking, I’m glad the unwavering hype for this author led me here (hah) because it honestly was a good fucking time. MZ fanatics, pls don��t come crawling through my walls. I may be a critic, but I could be one of y’all too <3 K thx bye.",467,7

Mariana Zaptata is hands down one of my favorite authors. She's the queen of slow burn and every time she releases a new book, I read it straight away. All Rhodes Lead Here was another win for me. I adored Rhodes and Aurora's story. Aurora De La Torre has been through a lot in the last year and decides to go back to her hometown to settle. She rents a garage apartment until she decides where she wants to be rooted permanently and she rents it from Tobias Rhodes. Tobias has no idea Aurora is coming into his life... literally. He never saw it coming. Rhodes and Aurora develop a friendship, even though it takes a bit of time for him to warm to her. This has got a bit of one of my favorite troupes- grumpy/sunshine and I loved that aspect so much. Tobias can be broody until you get to know him and Aurora is one of those heroines who overcomes all odds and does it as positively as she can. They make the perfect pairing and I wanted them together so badly. 
  
    “I’ve never met anybody like you.” “I hope that’s a good thing?” “I’ve met people who don’t know what it’s like to be sad. I’ve met resilient people. But you….” He shook his head, his gaze watching me closely in that rabid raccoon way. “You got this spark of life that nothing and no one has taken away despite the things that have happened to you, and I don’t understand how you still manage to… be you.”
  
Not only did I love Aurora and Rhodes together, I completely and utterly adored Rhodes son, Amos. I loved the bond he had with Aurora and how he and Rhodes were together. It was so special. Mariana Zapata's storytelling is incredible. I love the way she develops her characters and we get to watch all the goodness unfold. I never wanted this story to end. Between all fun times with Aurora living in the garage, to watching the friendship turn into more, and seeing all of Aurora's secrets come to light, gah! I loved it loads and it will most definitely be on my top favorites list of 2021.",435,19
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,jessica,"2,476",29600,5,"May 10, 2021","on paper, this should not have been a book that im giving 5 stars to. it has a lot of characteristics that i generally dont like: - a slow burn romance? no, more like absolutely glacial.- aurora is honestly way too immature to be 33 years old. when rhodes questions her age (convinced she is younger), i felt that. shes has the mentality of a late teenage. - single dad trope doesnt really do it for me.but heres why those surprisingly worked for me in this case:- i actually really enjoyed that aurora and rhodes become friends first. yes, the romance and pacing is slow, but i appreciated how their friendship developed and then became something more.- aurora may be immature, but man, shes hilarious. i cant remember the last time a book made me blow air out of my nose so much. there are so many interactions that left me highly amused. shes also very kind. so i was able to forgive her immaturity. - amos is honestly the most adorable kid ever. i dont really like children, but i would adopt him in a heartbeat.so while there are things that i dont normally like in a book, they are done in a way that had me loving this story. its actually a really sweet and quiet romance, one that feels real and honest. theres good character growth, really tender moments, and a lot of funny banter that should be had within a family.so i may as well round up to 5 stars. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯↠ 4.5 stars",288,6
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,EmBibliophile,461,1011,5,"April 6, 2021","4.5 starsThis was more than what I wished it would be! It was such a warm feel good atmospheric story that I absolutely loved!! Im just a sucker for a good slow burn romance and a cozy atmospheric setting. The more I read about the mountains and those wild places, the more I hate how broke I am that I can’t travel anywhere. One day tho. One. Day.I loved Aurora!! She was just so real and so admirable with the way she stood up for herself and how determined and such a relatable person she is. And that scene where she stood up for her mother in law and just kept talking and getting it all out?? I was freakin cheering and clapping so hard for her. I was so proud of her.Rhodes was such a grumpy sweetheart! I loved how he was always taking care of her. My only complain is the B-word that made me cringe so hard, but we aren’t gonna go there. And that scene when she came out and found the tent????? Don’t judge me, but I think I almost cried!! I loved Amos and his relationship with Aurora, it was so adorable and sweet!! I was just so happy for her that she managed to find a place for herself with people who love her. Also, I loved that when things got bad, they went after her. That scene was just ugggh.So we’ve got the perfect setting, an age gap, a silver fox, a grumpy/sunshine trope, a single dad with the sweetest kid, a small town with lovely friendly people, MZ famous slow burn romance, and we’ve got ourselves a weekend well spent! I was going to round down, but I had such an enjoyable time reading it so we’re rounding up!",204,34
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,Jessica ,"2,014",12800,5,"January 9, 2022","A grumpy, single dad who lives in the mountains??? Rhodes absolutely sold this book for me. Like other Mariana Zapata books, this one is a super slow burn. The hero and heroine barely even interact until 40% in. They don't kiss until 80% in. I was a little annoyed for the first half of the book because I was impatient. I loved these characters and knew there was potential between them, but we weren't being given anything!! But the payoff was so worth it. You know Rhodes was slowly burning with love and lust for Aurora and they both just needed time. Aurora is in town because she just got out of a 14 year relationship and she's still trying to cope with the loss of her mom. There was so much emotion in this book and I really loved the personal journey Aurora went on. One of my favorite characters, though, was definitely Amos. I loved his relationship with all of the adults in this book and how important he became to Aurora and Rhodes. As a character, Amos was so special and that definitely made me love this book more. For the romance, I absolutely loved the last 20% of this book where the romance was fleshed out. Rhodes was so grumpy but so protective and I loved how he was trying his best to be there for Aurora. I don't want to spoil anything, but I loved every scene with Rhodes discussing being in a relationship and being there for Aurora. This book just ended up being perfect and I couldn't recommend it enough! ",201,2

   Life didn't have to be perfect for you to be happy. Because what was perfect really, anyway?
Mariana Zapata, buddy, let's talk about your endearment game, shall we? You know a lot of authors have a certain formula they use for writing their books. Suzanne Wright, Kristen Ashley and Mariana Zapata are just three of those authors that come to mind that ALWAYS write their books and characters the same way, to the point that the characters in their books become almost interchangeable, just bc how similar they are. It can both be a blessing and a curse. Good, cause if it works, it works. Why change a running system. But if you start to expect something different, it can become boring quickly. 
  All Rhodes Lead Here
 worked for me, cuz I knew exactly what to expect when reading a MZ book and it's very comforting like coming home after an exhausting day at work. ARLH pretty much gave me the same vibes as Kulti/The Wall of Winnipeg and Me with a mix of some of her other books, but set in a small town somewhere in Colorado. tropes: age-gap (h: 33, H: 42), single parent, slow-burn, friends-to-lovers, small-town, sunshine-grumpy━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━PLOT━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━After a break up, Aurora returns to Pagosa Springs to begin her new life.

  Sometimes, maybe even more often than just sometimes, you were better off alone. Sometimes you had to learn to be your own best friend. To put yourself first.
Aurora is such a cute little bean without being overly sweet. She is such a positive ray of sunshine and I love her for it. Aurora's relationship with her mom seems adorable, I wished we got more shown through flashbacks than tell, but the way Aurora tried to go on all of her mom's fav hikes as to honor her. I thought it was cute. Her fear of rats and bats was so relatable lmao.

  I smiled at him. He didn't smile back, but that was alright.
Rhodes is the perfect grump and a mix between Reiner Kulti and Aiden Graves. The Heroes that don't talk that much, but show they care through their actions and that's exactly who Rhodes is. The quiet and overprotective dad who would walk through fire for everyone he cares about. He was such a good dad to Amos and I loved it as much as Aurora every time he went into dad mood with her. Rhodes might not be a talker, but WHEN he talks he's on point. When he was talking about taking it slow when they shared a bed together for the first time or when he defended Aurora before her ex. What a man. 😌━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━AMOS WHATEVER-HIS-LAST-NAME-IS-THE-FAMILY-TREE-IS-TOO-COMPLICATED━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━First of all Amos' parentage is confusing... his mum and dad couldn't get children, because Billy has trauma, so they asked Rhodes to be a sperm donor. Rhodes still wanted to be a dad and to be a part of Amos' life agreed, therefore Am has two dads and a mom. Am is living with Rhodes, because his mom wanted to do the Doctors Without Borders program and Am didn't want to go, so she leaves her son with Rhodes and the whole time I was like... buut how? why? when? you're just going to leave your only child with his other dad who was more absent in his life than in it just like that? when they come back... is Am just going to live with them again and Rhodes can visit? how is the arrangement? is it the same arrangement I image divorced parents have? anyway, back to Amos as a character...
  ""I'm good!"" I yelled back. ""Are you?""""Scarred for life watching you grab Dad's butt like that, but I'll get over it. Thanks for wondering!"" he hollered sarcastically before shaking his head and closing the door.
Amos is a very quiet and shy kid and I consider him one of the main characters since he's featured in the book a whole lot. One of the reason why the single parent trope is one of my fav tropes is, because I love reading about the development between the kid and the main character. Therefore, it's no surprise that one of my favorite thing about AHLH is the relationship between Amos and Aurora. It's so sweet how Am was so unsure around Aurora at the beginning and then started to open up to her more and more as the story progressed. How Aurora helped Am with his songwriting and singing and kept encouraging him. That was like their thing. ━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━THE ROMANCE━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━

No one can make me cheer for giving me the bare minimum of phyiscal contact as much as Mariana Zapata. I was smiling like a loon at every high five or hug (and there were a lot of hugs), because for these characters that's basically a love declaration. I was surprised that we didn't had to wait until the very last chapter until Rhodes and Aurora banged... it was actually much earlier, but everything else was slow. Rhodes and Aurora don't exchange phone numbers until 60% or smth or Aurora still calls Rhodes ""Mr. Rhodes"" for the longest times in the book without him telling her differently lol.

All Rhodes Lead Here was even slower than her usual slow-burn.

Let's talk about the big elephant, everyone just wants to ignore. The 'buddy' part. Ugh. I hated it. MZ has a lot of talents, but finding good endearments is not one of them. I tried to ignore it as much as possible, but Rhodes called Aurora 'buddy' 22 times. 22 times over 551 pages isn't too bad, but it still 22 times too many. Thank you god for all the angels and sweethearts that we got. I still couldn't help to feel like Rhodes put Aurora in the friend-zone every time he called her that. 😭🤚 i swear the only time i call someone 'buddy' is when she/he is under 14 yrs or when i acutally want to friend-zone someone. the cringe. 🥴and byeee the explanation for why he calls her buddy? ""You remind me of Buddy the Elf. You're always smiling. Always trying to make things better."" jeeeezzz, is that suppose to make it better? 😭am I the only one who thought that the drama with Kaden right at the end of the book (if I'm not mistaken the last chapter before the epilogue) was unnecessary???? There was not much plot, you have have inserted that drama somewhere between 5% and 90% of the book and I wouldn't have said a thing, because not much happened anyway, but putting it in the very last second.

    “You gotta come back.” “Come back?” I echoed like I’d never heard those words before. “Home,” they said at the same time.
  
I debated writing a review for this or not because I was unsure how I felt about this, but I think rating it 2 stars is enough.All Rhodes Lead Here simply follows Aurora as she moves to a place she once called home, Pagosa Springs, after being dumped by her long-term famous boyfriend. She wants to start a new life, one full of new opportunities and new memories. She's decided she will rent a garage apartment she saw online, get a job to earn money, and complete the hikes her mother wrote on a list. The story unfolds as Aurora begins a small friendship with her landlord, Mr. Rhodes, and his son, Amos.
  
    People cried over endings, but sometimes you had to cry over new beginnings.
  
The Good
  Mr. Rhodes.
 Zapata has a type. They're grumpy, tall, muscular, have nice thighs and a nice ass, and broody. With a few minor exceptions, Mr. Rhodes is a DILF on a whole other level. While he may not be THAT much older than Aurora, his personality, attitude, and physical features stand true to his age. He's grumpy and has no intention on becoming Aurora's friend, no matter how difficult it then becomes. There's no denying that Zapata knows how to create attractive grumpy characters, and Mr. Rhodes isn't anything new. I’ve seen reviews saying he’s a mix of Aiden and Kulti. While he may not be the best at communication, his actions speak louder than his words, and the soft spot he has inside of him begins to show as he befriends Aurora.I've noticed that's a pattern in Zapata's books. Her male leads seem to be unable to communicate the best. They're not the best at showing their emotions and expressing their feelings, but they show the love and care they have for their friends in different ways. Rhodes is no exception to this, and I'm honestly not complaining. I love it. He's grumpy and tired at first, but his character development starts to unfold as he realizes there is actually more to Aurora than he thought.
  
    Rhodes really was the hottest forty-two-year-old on the planet. He had to be. At least, I thought so.
  

  The romance | part 1.
 Honestly, the romance between Aurora and Rhodes was not my favorite because of its development. However, I still really, really enjoyed the romantic scenes between Rhodes and Aurora. My favorite? When Rhodes set up a tent and camping chairs outside their apartment because Aurora's plans of going camping were changed. That was truly a top tier moment, one that ended many other romantic scenes. Small things like that make my heart ache and surround it with warmth and happiness.
  
    “I looked for your tent in the garage and in your car, but it wasn’t there. If you want to bring it down, we can set it up in a minute. But mine is a two-person.” He stopped suddenly, talking that was, and leaned forward, squinting at me in the dark. “Are you crying?”
  
Or when she went on the hike alone.
  
    That entire beefy, hunky body trembled lightly, I faintly noticed. “No more hiking by yourself,” he whispered roughly, so hoarse it scared me. “No more.”
  
Or when he called Aurora's date an idiot and called her beautiful.
  
    His jaw was tight again. The lines across his forehead were back too. “You look beautiful,” Mr. Rhodes said in that careful, somber voice a heartbeat later. “He’s an idiot for looking at anyone else.”
  
Yes, my heart swooned.
  The setting.
 I'm from New Mexico, and Colorado is like a second home to me. I've been to Pagosa Springs, CO since I was young, and I'm aware of Colorado's rocky mountains. Being from New Mexico, an altitude like Colorado's and mountains surrounding every area is nothing new, which was why I loved how involved hiking and the outdoors was. I may not be aware of them, but imagining them is still possible. I simply love mountains more than the beach, and reading about a character who finds peace and comfort around mountains, alone in the woods, is refreshing.
  
    “You don’t ever have to hide it—your grief. Not from me.”
  
The BadUnfortunately, there is more ""bad"" than ""good"" for me in this book.
  Aurora.
 I forgot Aurora was in her 30's sometimes. It felt like she was still very immature, or if she was in her mid 20s and still looking for guidance in every sense of her being. I found her annoying at times, which made the reading experience worse because the grumpy hero/sunshine heroine is a trope I love. But with a character like Aurora, it difficult to do so. She was annoying and frustrating throughout a part of the book. While I found her to be strong in other times (such as how she wanted to complete her mother's hikes and make her proud), or how I understood the grief she felt (especially towards the ending), I couldn't find myself sympathizing with her all the time. 
  The b-word.
 Many other reviewers have pointed this out already, but the whole ""buddy"" business was so weird. I remember my first reaction to Rhodes referring to Aurora as buddy was just ""what the fuck"". It kept going for page after page, so I got used to it, but it still was annoying. I felt nothing but relief when he would call her angel/angel face or sweetheart instead. I haven't read Hands Down, which features Zac from The Wall of Winnipeg and Me as the lead, but I know he calls the female lead ""kiddo"", and I just find that strange. Weird. It's not gross to me (either buddy or kiddo), but it's just so fucking weird. Out of all the nicknames, you decide going with something you call your child, or your dog, or any minor person? Seriously, I got really tired having to see Rhodes tell Aurora ""hey, buddy"" every chance he got. It was tiresome. And weird. Just. Weird. 
  Too much filler.
 The book felt like it could have been shorter, but true Zapata style, it wasn't. Like the whole family tree of Amos? I felt like that could have been shortened down to something more simple instead of making it so complicated. I can't even describe it because I didn't get it myself, but it was confusing to read about how Amos is related to Rhodes but also his uncle in a way because of how his uncle couldn't have a child? Honestly, I forgot it already. I wish it had been more simple because it not only would have made the situation easier to understand (like reducing the family tree to just Amos and Rhodes), but it would have made the story shorter.
  The romance | part 2.
 In my opinion, the romance actually developed a lot quicker than I thought it would, so that was the only quibble I can point out. Rhodes and Aurora's feelings were very clear towards each other before I even realized it. The sex scene they had was also a lot more smutty compared to Zapata's other books and it did not wait until the end. This was something I didn't like, if I'm being honest, because I wanted it to continue being slow burn, and I wanted the sexual tension to continue developing. While Rhodes is grumpy, I found him to be . . . not grumpy enough? Seriously, I wanted him to be more of an asshole than he supposedly was. It wasn't even 200 pages in when the two were already having a conversation as if Rhodes hadn't yelled at her 100 pages before. Seriously, if there wasn't unnecessary drama and filler (like the situation with Aurora and her boyfriend + his mom, and the entire family tree confusion), perhaps Rhodes could have continued being a grumpy hero for a couple 200 pages more. It wouldn't be until page 300 or so for him to finally start developing and become somewhat nice to Aurora. But no, it was between page 180 when he, Amos, and Aurora go on a hike together and he starts becoming nice. He also called her ""angel"" for the first time in page 214 and ""buddy"" in page 226. *Sigh*. It was too early fam. Not enough slow-burn and tension for me.
  
    “I know how I want you to feel, but I’m not rushing you. I know how I feel. I haven’t changed my mind about anything, especially not you. I only want you to be sure of what you want.”
  
Mariana Zapata is becoming a new binge-worthy author. All of her books (except Kulti, sadly) are on Kindle Unlimited, so I want to take the advantage of reading them before its too late. The one I'm looking forward to the most is Hands Down, and I'm prepared to deal with the cringe I will feel when Zac calls Bianca kiddo. Yes, I am.All Rhodes Lead Here was, sadly, not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. There were too many obstacles that made the reading experience too dry. I hope her other books make up for this one.

You know what Zapata does well in her books, at least the ones I’ve read so far? The characters transition from “enemies” to friends before becoming lovers, and that always helps in feeling the chemistry that the author intended for us to feel.Aurora moves back to her hometown after ending a really long shitty relationship. She is renting a space that is provided by Tobias Rhodes. It was his son, Amos, who actually rented her the space without his permission and he was really pissed. He gave in after she offered higher pay and promised to stay in her own lane. What are the circumstances that bring this family together? We learn a lot about Aurora throughout the book and the things that have made her who she is today. Her mom went missing a while ago and no one knows what happened to her. The plot about her mom was really heartbreaking. Does she get closure about this part of her life? Another big thing in this book was her past of songwriting. I thought this was really cool especially when we get to understand what her songs mean to her. Honestly, this character was amazing. A character who is actually really interesting is hard to come by okay. And she was soooooo funny!!! Tobias and Amos Rhodes were obviously a big part of this story and I also enjoyed learning more about them and their interesting family. In particular, I love how Zapata shows the growing relationship with both of them individually. We get a lot of scenes with just Aurora and Amos, just Aurora and Tobias, and Aurora with both of them. I really want to stress how important that was for me. Her falling in love with both of them in different ways made this a really wholesome story. Nothing felt forced in this book!! I died a little the first time Tobias called her “sweetheart.”I loved loved loved the growth we see in all these characters, especially Aurora. You just come to a point in your life where you really just tell people to fuck off. I’m still personally processing this in my own life, so reading stuff like that always feels like a sign of some sort. Overall, this was really worth it. I sometimes forget how good books can be!!",161,20

57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,Arini ~ Miss Casually Reading,666,1499,5,"September 7, 2021","4.5 starsi wanted more swoons and more... tingles, and for a good chunk of the inner monologues to be cut down. also, maybe for Rhodes to feel more like THE hero alongside Aurora as the heroine, yknow what i mean??? as a main character, he wasnt quite on the same level as Aurora with less character depth.but since those concerns are nothing new when it comes to MZs brand of romance, so ok i can live with this. mostly because,
1. it wasnt a sports romance. (thank you, Lord!) for that alone, this has become my favorite MZ book.2. Rhodes was a DILF without him even having to ~tRy~ or be married first and conceive baby Amos conventionally. can you guess how that was possible?? this... what should i call it... creative “modification” of the single dad trope is my new favorite thing. 👏👏3. the relationship between Rhodes and Aurora felt sooo real, open, and honest. the fact that they became friends first and that Rhodes actually waited for Aurora to get settled and feel comfortable with herself?? yes Rhodes, you couldnt be more perfect.4. there may be too much slow and not nearly enough burn and steam as i wouldve liked, but i was absolutely a sucker for the growing intimacy and all the tender moments between the MCs.like when Rhodes started calling Aurora angel face, or when he told her she was beautiful, or when he tended to her wounds after her failed hike?? oorrr when they hugged for the first time and every time after that??? 😭😭
5. this life right here (except the part about dealing with grief and having a mamas boy who was a complete loser for an ex-husband) is the stuff of dreams. i KENNOT tell you enough how much i love mountain man/outdoorsy small town romance.after finishing the book, my immediate reaction was to give it four stars. but upon writing this review, there was really no reason that bothered me too much to not throw in the five stars. so, here you go. thank you MZ for finally serving me with my favorite kind of story with all of my favorite tropes.ps. btw is MZ a self-published author?? i hate that her audiobooks dont get released on the same day as her other formats.Similar recommendation:↠ The Simple Wild",151,34
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,G,411,117,4,"June 23, 2021","4 starsThis book was EVERYTHING!!!I've always loved reading anything Mariana Zapata has written and this book probably sits at the top. It had everything I loved; a slow-burn, small-town romance. I can not even begin to express the joy I felt in this book. Aurora's personality alone was really refreshing to see.A huge factor as to why I really enjoyed this book was the friendship she developed first with Amos and Rhodes; it really was what had sold me from the beginning.As the story progressed, I felt more attached and had to finish reading it all in one go. When Amos and Rhodes showed up at Clara's house thinking Aurora was running away left me in tears. The three of them have such a strong familial connection, that it left me feeling bittersweet.The last 3 chapters were by far my favourite in the whole book. I definitely see myself having  All Rhodes Lead Here as a comfort read. Marina Zapata has continued time and time again to produce amazing stories that I will always read.",144,1 comment
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,Aviva’s Library,227,2568,5,"December 20, 2022","THIRD RE-READ (December’22) - Every time I re-read an MZ book, I think that specific one is my number one favorite… but I’m pretty sure I really mean it when I say it about this one SECOND READ REVIEW (September���22) - This was the first book I ever read by MZ and I always knew that I loved it - but now that I’ve read all of her books (and a few of them more than once already) I think this one might actually be my favorite. I always felt like this one had a slower start than some of her other ones and therefore I always put different ones on top of this one on my favorites list —- but now that I reread it, I realized that I was so wrong about thinking that and it actually has more or less the same pacing as all of her other books that I love - I think I just felt that way because this was the first one I read, so at the time I wasn’t used to her style yet. But either way… I’m so happy I decided to re-read it. For so many reasons I absolutely loved it - but I think one thing that stood out to me this time was how unrushed the ending felt in comparison to a lot of her other books where I’m always begging for just one or two more chapters. I think this one was very well rounded and all of the plot points felt like they were nicely closed off by the end… plus we actually got more than half a second to enjoy the couple together which is something we don’t really ever get with her other stories… so I especially loved that. I also think something I love about MZ slow burns in general is how realistic they feel. Just the progression of letting someone into your life, slowly learning about them over time and getting close to them - the way MZ portrays that is one of my favorite things about her writing style... and specifically in this book I think that idea was done really well.FIRST READ REVIEW (July ‘21) - I would give it more than 5 stars if it was an option",134,4
57605091,All Rhodes Lead Here,♡tanaz♡,189,2929,3,"April 8, 2021","✨3.5 stars✨Ok so a bitch was really excited for this. the uk was doing it's thing, giving me sunshine so i could enjoy this in the garden & the tropes were troping i mean:☆ age gap (a true silver fox yum😍)★ slowburn☆ witty/sunshine heroine and a grumpy hero★ single dad (a dilf to end all dilfs)☆ small-town vibes ★ thematic focus (music/adventure from hiking)✨The plot:✨Aurora De La Torre (h) is newly divorced from her famous ex who she used to write songs for but was hidden from the public as his gf as his family thought it was best for his image to come off as single. Tired of being the last choice she left and put herself first, going back to the small town she grew up in where her mother went missing 20 years ago. She rents out a house for her stay however when she gets there turns out the son Amos, rented the room out to her behind his dad Tobias Rhodes (H) back. He was angry and at first said no, but Aurora agreed to pay triple to stay. From there, her new adventure started where she went on hikes to feel closer to her mum, worked with her school best friend at her shop, whilst lowkey crushing on Rhodes who gave off very much ""you're annoying stay away from me"" vibes to her when in reality he was also crushing right back on her as time went on. ✨My thoughts✨all of those tropes kind of worked, rhodes gave of that rip (Luna and the Lie)/dallas (Wait for It) vibes with his grumpiness, the slow burn here was actually one of the fastest in terms of Mariana books, usually there's more angst but here between the couple i felt things moved at an okay pace, the sex scene for once wasn't the very last chapter lol. BUT i felt like the book was still too long? don't get me wrong i love when authors put a heavy focus surrounding themes within a book for example, loved the football (I'm english soccer isn't real) stuff in Kulti and ice skating in From Lukov with Love, however the hiking stuff here may have dragged on a bit too much and i was bored by the time aurora went on her 632384749th hike.i loved amos he was a star for me in this book i wish we got more of the domestic homey scenes, rather than the hiking. as for aurora i really wanted to love her like i did sal and diana, but she was a bit of a cry baby and acted more like she was 25 not 33. her personality didn't really add up to her age, sometimes she was truly cringey. as for rhodes i wish we got a bit more personality from him?? he was so dry in the first half, the ending really helped me like him, esp after the mini drama of them saying rora lied about her ex when she really didn't lie she just didn't mention that her ex was some rich and famous douche. buttttttttt can we talk about the nicknames pls because buddy and angel face are NOT it 💀 they just came outta nowhere and it gave me the ick!!!the epilogue was cute and it gave me the family vibes i wanted, loved the way rora confronted her ex kaiden, esp how rhodes stood up for her like kaiden really thought 14 years of being a 11th choice was gonna win over a few months of being someones no 1 priority. quality over quantity ladies. anyways, i'm sad because i wanted this to be a banger like Kulti/Wait for It, but atleast it wasn't as bad as Dear Aaron lmao (god i will NEVER get back the 5 hours i spent reading that borefest, sorry to any ruby and aaron stans, mariana did not do their story justice!!!). I was hoping this would give me the feels that The Simple Wild gave me but unfortunately the good stuff in this book could've been condensed to maybe 375/400 pages, even tho I LOVE LOVE LOVE a good 500+ page book esp if it's from mariana.",132,12
