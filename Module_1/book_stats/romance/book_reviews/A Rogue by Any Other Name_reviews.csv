10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,Blacky *Romance Addict*,464,6201,5,"December 6, 2016","“I am too imperfect for you,” he whispered at her temple.“You are perfectly imperfect for me.”I just... I love this book. I love the cover. I love the writing; every single sentence. I enjoyed reading it. I love the plot, oh yes, no better plot than revenge. I love the characters, both of them. But most of all; I love you Sarah MacLean  Gimme more books like these  “You have my land, Penelope,” he whispered at her ear, the sound low and liquid and altogether too distracting even as it sent tremors of anxiety spiraling through her, “and I want it back.”She shook her head, eyes closed as he wreaked havoc on her senses. “I can’t give it to you.”He stroked one hand down her arm in a long, lovely caress, taking her wrist in his firm, warm clasp. “No, but I can take it.”
The storyMichael, Marquess of Bourne, lost all he ever had one night in a game of cards. And that night his life made a turn, toward one goal: Revenge. 
  
Now a powerful man, co-owner of London's most famous gaming hell, he's prepared to do anything to accomplish his goal, even marry his childhood friend, Lady Penelope Marbury. 
  
To up her chance in getting married, Penelope's father increased her dowry, with Michael's lost estate. She doesn't really want to get married, well, she does, but out of love. After learning about the dowry, she goes for a walk in the old estate, and comes across Michael 
  
 But soon her happiness evaporates when said man abducts her and decides to ruin her reputation enough so that she'd have no other choice but to marry him 
  

  
    “You’re thinking again.”She was. She was thinking he was magnificent. “I can’t help it.” She shook her head, reaching for him.“Then I am not doing it correctly.”Oh dear. If he kissed her any more correctly, her sanity would be threatened.
  
BourneI still like the name Michael better <3 Anyway, he was very young when he lost it all, and it was a very hard lesson in life. Having lost his parents too, he had no one to turn to, not for affection, not for support. 
  
 Years later, he is a ruthless man, knows no compassion, and is willing to do absolutely anything to carry out his revenge. He compromises Penelope and marries her, swearing to give her anything she would ever want, aside from his affection. What truobles him the most is that he WANTS to give her his affection. 
  
Ah I just loved him. Tortured hero, affraid to love, affraid to get close to anyone, thinking he'll corrupt anything he touches 
  
 My heart just broke for him. Even though, I wanted to hit him a few times, stubborn man! 
  
But esentially, he had to choose; revenge or Penelope. 
  

  
    “The worst part is that if I don’t send you back, I’m going to want to keep you here.And you’ll hate me for it.” He closed his eyes and whispered, “You deserve better.”So much better than me.“Michael,” she said softly, “there’s no one better. Not for me.”
  

  

  
    ""She was falling in love with the part of him that ice-skated, played charades, teased her with wordplay, and smiled at her as though she were the only woman in the world. She was falling in love with the kindness that lurked beneath his exterior.And there was a part of her, dark and quiet, that was falling in love with the rest of him. She did not know how she could manage being in love with all of him. He was too much.""
  
PenelopeHaving no choice but to marry Michael, she asks him to show her passion, exictement, life. 
  
 Although he is nothing like the youth she once knew and loved, she still can't help but be intrigued by him. Attracted by him. And she wants more. More than just a marriage of convenience, she wants to be more to him than a means to an end. BUT, that's exactly what Michael doesn't want. And so he hurts her to keep her away. 
  
Boy my heart broke for her too. I understood them both, but the constant suffering, NOT a big fan 
  
 but it was so worth it 
  
And one more thing I adored; the letters! Oh those were so sweet, their corespondence when they were childern, and later only on her side 
  
 Just loved!The ending! Simply PERFECT! The best way for the story and I'm so glad it turned out the way it did! I'd give the book 10 more stars just for that bit 
  
This is my favorite quote, and it goes perfectly with the theme of the book (gambling)
  
    “I can’t take small tastes of you, love. I can only gorge on you. You’re irresistible.” He pressed a kiss to her shoulder, his tongue coming out to lave the skin there. “You’re like the rattle of dice. The shuffle of cards. You call to me until I ache with desire for you.” The words were a whisper of breath at the base of her neck. “I could easily become addicted to you.”
  
To Sarah MacLean:

10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,Samantha,401,16600,4,"March 7, 2020","This is one of the best Hades and Persephone retellings I’ve read, mostly because it gets the Persephone characters personality right. She’s a good mix of innocence and wanting adventure and choosing the “underworld”; a battle queen in her own right. This one also added a twist of the characters being childhood friends so there was a history there that made the development of the relationship much more believable. This is my first historical romance but I’d continue with this series and read more from this author. ",148,2

Wow, wow, wow! What a fabulous read! *hugging my Kindle* Prepare yourself to be gushed upon.From revenge to love. Michael intends to corrupt Penelope. He wants to turn her from light to dark, from good to bad. His goal is to totally ruin her. And it will feel so splendid. A Rogue by Any Other Name is such a great example why I love to read HR. *does the happy dance*Despite my minor issues--a jerk-ish hero and his opinion of being not worthy enough for our lovable heroine and the ending that felt a bit corny and a heroine who was a bit too weepy for my liking--I totally devoured this book. Yeah, seconds and minutes passed. Hours…but it didn't matter. All that mattered was this book and these characters. I want more!""Do you? Do you see how much I value you? Do you feel it? (…) ""I adore you,"" he whispered. ""I wish I could be the man you deserve."" She lifted her own hand to capture his at her cheek. ""Michael…you can be that man.""Darn, Michael, you deserve Penelope! Just open your mind and your heart and look thoroughly.London 1831Michael wants Falconwell back. The land he had lost ten years ago while gambling and vowed to regain. At any cost--even if he had to marry an aging spinster. Their ""first"" encounter was very entertaining.""Sirrah! Do not come any closer! I…"" she flailed for a decent threat. ""I am armed!""His response was unmoved. ""Do you plan to smother me with your muff?""""You, sir, are not a gentleman.""""Ah. Truth at last.""She took another step back. ""I am going home.""""I don't think so, Penelope.""Penelope was a means to an end--the path to Michael's revenge. Every time he touched her or showed her the slightest interest, it was for his benefit and his goals. Naturally, Penelope didn't want to be a part of his revenge though. Well, Michael is rather surprised to discover that this woman, this marriage means so much more to him. It scared him.Yes, I love it! Yes, I totally dig the characters, the witty, richly-textured and wonderful dialogue and most of all…the love scenes…they left me gloriously breathless. My oh my, this woman knows how to write utterly sensual and erotic love scenes. A Rogue by Any Other Name displays romance at its best. I adored the kissing and touching. It was so well-written. Kudos, Ms. MacLean! Boy, I was consumed with excitement, with breathlessness while reading A Rogue by Any Other Name. Even though there are not a lot of love scenes, they were so well-placed. That said, they were there because the path of anticipation has been exhausted and I was on the brink of being combusted. He wanted her that moment. Immediately. Without hesitation. So he lifted her in his arms and carried her up the stairs. Up to decadence. Up to pleasure.Oh, yes, Michael's adventuresome beauty will discover how utterly sensual and erotic love-making can be. And even though Penelope is not a beauty in the common sense, we all know that beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. Michael believes that Penelope is a beauty and love makes you feel beautiful and cherished, after all.The characters are splendid. Michael and Penelope are complex and very interesting. Penelope knows how to speak tartly and I relished her smart mouth. Michael. The jerk. Most of the time a jerk makes a good hero, and the dark and brooding Michael was a great hero. Furthermore, it didn't hurt at all that he was so handsome and he was perfect with his hands and mouth. I can't deny that his sexual prowess was fabulous and I loved his deadpan humor. Overall it was such a pleasure to witness their evolving relationship.Guess what? The author portrayed many intriguing secondary characters in this book and I'm utterly convinced that Cross and Lady Philippa's story will be another winner when I was reading this:""Well, since you came all the way here…how may I be of service, Lady Philippa?"" She took a deep breath. Released it. ""I require ruination. And I hear you are an expert in the subject.""I can't wait to read their story. Patience, Baba…A Rogue by Any Other Name is a wonderfully penned and witty HR. I am so glad that I discovered another great HR author. I'm off reading Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",89,59
10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish,"1,166",1569,5,"March 5, 2013","A Rogue by Any Other Name is the first book in Sarah MacLean’s The Rules of Scoundrels series and from the first page to the last is filled with emotion – happiness, heartbreak, passion, romance – a truly fabulous story!I often find, with historical romances, that the rules society has placed on the women can make them seem mousey and pathetic, so I love it when an author takes those women and makes them strong enough to laugh at their peers – or at least not care enough to conform to what’s expected of them. That always makes for some funny, sexy stories, and that’s what Ms. MacLean has done with A Rogue by Any Other Name. What a scoundrel wants, a scoundrel gets...A decade ago, the Marquess of Bourne was cast from society with nothing but his title. Now a partner in London’s most exclusive gaming hell, the cold, ruthless Bourne will do whatever it takes to regain his inheritance—including marrying perfect, proper Lady Penelope Marbury.A broken engagement and years of disappointing courtships have left Penelope with little interest in a quiet, comfortable marriage, and a longing for something more. How lucky that her new husband has access to such unexplored pleasures.Bourne may be a prince of London’s underworld, but he vows to keep Penelope untouched by its wickedness—a challenge indeed as the lady discovers her own desires, and her willingness to wager anything for them... even her heart.I thoroughly enjoyed the Love By Numbers series – in fact, I’ve often said that if I could choose to be any heroine from a historical romance novel, it would be Lady Calpurnia Hartwell from Nine Rules to Break When Romancing A Rake. She’s strong, independent, feisty, funny… I’d be her in a heartbeat, but to be honest, I feel that way about most of Sarah MacLean’s heroines. Rarely do I get as attached to the heroine of a story as I do to the hero, but with this author’s books, I always do. But I digress….Our hero, Michael, Marquess of Bourne, is horrible! He’s not just an ass, he’s a pain in the ass! And I adored every single bit of him! You just know that in the end, he’s going to get his, and watching it come about is just so much fun! We go from him devising his plan for revenge, then watching him carry it out, knowing that he never considers - not even for a moment - that it won’t go as flawlessly as he expected. Then we see, bit by bit, the transformation; the shock when he starts to question his motives, his feelings, his true wants and desires. I absolutely love watching this transformation!Our heroine, Lady Penelope Marbury, truly is my kind of woman. As I said above, Sarah MacLean is one of the few authors who can write heroines who are as perfect as her heroes. Penelope is, in some ways, a victim of her times, but she doesn’t let those suffocating rules of society keep her from having an “adventure”. I LOVE this about her! She reminds me somewhat of Lady Calpurnia, and perhaps that’s why I adore her so much. She didn’t sit about whimpering or simpering as she did her needlework, waiting for something exciting to happen. Nope! She found ways to create her own excitement. I love how she took life by the horns and didn’t let go!And the story! Oh, my goodness! Take a rake – or in this case, a rogue – and give him a truly compelling, believable need for revenge, then toss in an innocent, but not naïve, heroine, and you have the makings of an incredible story, and that’s what this one is. Twists, turns, heartache and happiness – never a dull moment and I adored every word! The bottom line: It probably goes without saying, but I can’t say it enough – I love this story! It was filled with emotion and had me laughing, sighing and fanning myself, start to finish. Sarah MacLean is one of the few “auto-buy” authors on my list, and books like A Rogue by Any Other Name is why.I am soooo looking forward to the next book in the series, One Good Earl Deserves a Lover and cannot wait to watch Penelope’s sister, Lady Philippa Marbury, match wits with the man known only as Cross, the bookkeeper of the The Fallen Angel gaming hell. That is a story guaranteed to deliver everything I crave in historical romance, and a story not to be missed!",56,46
10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",832,39900,4,"February 8, 2013","After having read so many insipid, good, but uncomplicated Regency romances lately, this book was a breath of fresh air for me.The Marquess of Bourne had a dissolute youth, and lost his family estate to of at through a game of cards, and decides to make it his mission in life to get his estate back as well as get revenge on the man who won it from him (Viscount Langford and his innocent son, Tommy). Frankly, I think that Langford did him a favor, since that was the kick in the ass that got him off his ass and doing something with his life. 10 years later, Bourne finds out that Langford lost the estate to his childhood friend, Lady Penelope's father, and the estate is tied to her dowry. Penelope has survived a scandal of being jilted by her fiancée, a duke, years ago, and her reputation has suffered since. Her father is determined to marry her off, and the addition of the Falconwell estate is designed to attract a bevy of suitors.Bourne, determined as hell to get his estate back, all but kidnaps and compromises Penelope, and all but forces her to marry him. The marriage is off to a bad start, filled with negotiations and threats, more of a business deal than anything resembling love. Penelope misses her childhood friend, who is now an unrecognizable shadow of himself, hell-bent on revenge and nothing else. They pretend to be in love in the eyes of the Ton, but the early days of marriage is fraught with Bourne ignoring her and his own heart, and a fair bit of misunderstanding.Halfway through the book, to my delight, Bourne realizes he has been an asshole, and starts trying to make it up to her; Penelope is suspicious, a leopard doesn't change his stripes, after all. Their reconciliation is sweet, but Bourne's need for revenge consumes him and threatens to tear them apart.I really liked this book, I liked the other members of the Fallen Angels Club, and look forward to reading their stories. I especially disliked Olivia, Penelope's sister, who is a frilly, fluffy, empty-headed girl, and hope she will get her own book later on when she matures.",47,2

    I choose you. I choose love.
  
And the world says, ""aww...""I think my weeks-long book slump finally ended when I decided to go back and finish the second half of this. It's really too bad that I seem to have a roadblock every single time I try out a new Historical Romance author. No other genre works me over in such a way, to where I'm stuck in an exact idea of what I want to be reading (a.k.a. Kleypas type of wit), and if my ideals are not met right away, I tend to balk and kick my feet until someone slaps me on the back of the head and tells me to snap out of it.Thankfully, I snapped out of it. After knocking back a couple of PNR's, I finally put my big girl pants on and buckled down to read A Rogue by Any Other Name. I'm so happy that I continued on! Once I got used to the author's style of writing, I was able to sink into the story. Even though wit was not very prominent in the execution, MacLean still delivered with a not-too-formal flow, which made my read even more palatable the further I progressed. This really was an 'aww' type of tale. There's something about childhood friends-turned enemies-turned lovers which appeals to me. Chemistry is not easily developed in many stories, but I fell in love with this couple who conversed over the years of separation through letters. And one day, those letters stopped. A revenge plan set in motion started a path of ruin in what could have been a long and lovely friendship.
  
    If there was one thing of which she was certain, it was that Bourne would never allow her to be hurt.Unless, of course, he was doing the hurting.
  
But oh yes...the best passion can come from immense conflict.
  
    ""I'm going to make love to you on this fur. You're going to feel it against every inch of you, and the pleasure I give you will be more than you've ever imagined.""
  
I'm sure that PETA will not approve of the above statement. Ah well.Speaking of PETA, this phrase made me think of the phrase 'tastes like chicken.'
  
    She tasted like innocence.
  
So of course, I can't just keep in the sweet romance frame of mind...oh no...my mind immediately goes to an image best used for a horror book.Image hidden inside, click only if you dare!
  
But anyway...my mind goes to strange places. You all know that about me by now.I ended up enjoying this for what it was - a lovely little historical romance. I'll be checking out book 2 in the near future.

Now a partner in London’s most exclusive gaming hell, the cold, ruthless Bourne will do whatever it takes to regain his inheritance—including marrying perfect, proper Lady Penelope Marbury. A broken engagement and years of disappointing courtships have left Penelope with little interest in a quiet, comfortable marriage, and a longing for something more. How lucky that her new husband has access to such unexplored pleasures. Bourne may be a prince of London’s underworld, but he vows to keep Penelope untouched by its wickedness—a challenge indeed as the lady discovers her own desires, and her willingness to wager anything for them . . . even her heart.- My Thoughts -Love, love, love this book! It's a good choice for those who enjoy a 'jerky hero', to borrow a phrase from GR pal Alyssa;-) Bourne is dark, and working hard to be somewhat awesomely, unrepentantly villainous. He's my kind of hero, that's for sure:) Think Anne Stuart-lite (*very* lite, but, still...). Little does Bourne know that it will be impossible to keep his distance, physically and emotionally, from his lady wife. Ahhh, they ALL believe they can succeed at that, don't they? It's a be-a-u-tiful thing to watch them fail:)Lady Penelope is 29, and 'on the shelf', as they say. However, she has never stopped thinking of and, maybe somewhat secretly, pining for her childhood friend, now the Marquess of Bourne. This one's a girl after my own heart! By God, she's tired of being proper and doing what her family demands of her. And, once she marries Bourne, all bets are off! She's going to have adventures and a life of her own regardless of what her husband thinks. Yet, still, with an innate kindness and strong sense of responsibility, she does this in her own quiet, charming way. Bourne and Penelope are electric together! One can't help but enjoy them immensely!! This story has everything one could want: emotion, a reluctant hero, a kind but adventurous heroine, and some yummy, steamy scenes! I am SO looking forward to the next book!! The men of The Fallen Angel are sexy and fascinating!- My Favorite Quote -""I'm going to corrupt you,"" he promised her skin, one hand sliding down the swell of her stomach, feeling the way the muscles there tensed and quivered at his touch.

10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,Nicolette,117,88,5,"October 12, 2021","EDIT: bumping up to 5 stars because I am realizing how much I actually loved Penelope and Bourne. I keep coming back and re-reading some scenes from their book. Loved the angst in this. “Don’t look so miserable. Thank your stars you’ll finally have yourself a husband. With Falconwell in your dowry, you could win yourself a prince.” Lady Penelope Marbury used to be the darling of the ton but then everything had changed when her engagement to the the Duke of Leighton was broken off. Years later, the broken engagement is still whispered about by the ton. At 28, she is considered a spinster. But the love match between the Duke and Duchess of Leighton made Penelope realize that she wanted something more in a marriage. Love. And so, she hasn't really accepted anyone's proposal of marriage in years. A decade ago, Michael, Marquess of Bourne, lost everything. Except his title. Now, he's wealthier than he's ever been but he does not have the one thing he truly wants; Falconwell. The land that was his that he gambled away all those years ago. And if the land comes with a bride, so be it. A Rogue by Any Other name is Lady Penelope Marbury (Simon's ex fiancee) and Michael, Marquess of Bourne's book. Well, it seems I'm on a ""Rogue/Scoundrels"" binge. I can't help it. I love those kind of heroes. I won't take a shit from a man in real life, but I surely tolerate it a lot in fiction. When we first meet Penelope in Simon and Juliana's book, she seemed shallow and just like every other aristocrat, thinks of marriage as a duty. She was well-liked, considering that she almost made the match of the decade. Until, she didn't. The engagement was overshadowed by her fiance's love match. Penelope realized that marriage could be something more. That there could be marriages that are purely for love. And deep inside, she hoped for that. Michael, on the other hand, has been fueled by revenge. He worked very hard to restore the wealth that he lost. Now he's three times richer, with more money than any man could spend in a lifetime. But he isn't happy. He wants Falconwell. And he wants to ruin the man who took it all and ruined him. His reputation is besmirched. He was young and a fool, liked the feeling of winning and never knowing when to stop. Until he lost it all. After years of waiting, Falconwell seems perfectly attainable. He just needs to marry Lady Penelope, his childhood friend. Penelope, Michael and Tommy were best friends. Penelope has always liked Michael best. She wrote letters to him when he was in Eton. Wrote letters to him when his parents had died. Wrote letters to him even when he did not reply anymore. Wrote letters to him that remained unsent. They haven't seen each other in more than a decade and so Penelope was very happy to recognize Michael when she was going out for a walk in the night in her land (Falconwell, technically). But that happiness quickly vanished when she realized that he isn't the same man that she loved so dearly as a friend. He was Forcing her hand in marriage in order to have Falconwell back. But at least his intentions were true, he did not even try to lie to her. She was already full of guilt, thinking of accepting Tommy's proposal. After all, she's not getting any younger and she has sisters to think of. She has to get married so that her sisters could make excellent matches. Being a spinster isn't a good look, especially as the eldest daughter of a double marquess. And so, she accepted Michael's offer. I liked Penelope's character because she was a selfless girl but she did not let Michael walk all over her. What I did not like was the silly ""Adventures"" she craved. Like, what? going to a gambling club that your husband owned isn't an adventure. Surely, it was exciting but that's just that. It felt silly. And she reminded me of Lady Calpurnia's silly list. Which I did not like very much. Aside from that, I liked her enough to root for her happy ending. As for the hero, Michael, I liked him. Sure he was an ass. But that was expected. The title is literally ""A rogue by any other name"". But my god, he was frustrating! Pushing his wife away, saying things that he did not mean and regrets later on and feeling like he was not enough for her. His reputation is ruined while his wife has been a proper lady all her life. Penelope did not feel enough for her husband as well. Like, they are so frustrating! I wanted to slap some sense to the both of them. Just! Talk! Stop! Assuming! Things! The hero is also very immature for most part of the book, wanting nothing but to ruin viscount Langford, Tommy's father. Who also used to be his friend. I was glad that he did not stoop so low. He was afraid of losing his wife if he continued with the revenge shit he has going on, so....besides, Tommy was likeable. So he was a bastard. Who cares? The ton, surely. But he does not deserve to suffer for his father's doing. Over all, it was a really engaging book. I have at least 500 annotations. It was frustrating but it was that engaging. I was rooting for Penelope and Michael from the start. I loved their first meeting after decades of not seeing each other. Their chemistry was off the charts so I had no choice but to root for them. The letters at the beginning of each chapters made me smile and made me sad too, depending on what it contained. This book served the childhood friends-strangers-lovers trope well and I loved every bit of it. This particular paragraph made me sad, ""She’d written him letters, dozens of them over several years before her father had refused to mail any more. After that, she’d continued to write, hoping that he would somehow know that she was thinking of him. That he would always have friends at Falconwell . . . in Surrey . . . no matter how alone he might have felt. She’d imagined that one day, he’d come home. But he hadn’t returned. Ever."" Penelope was so loyal to him. And the fact that Michael never responded... but he did keep the letters which redeemed him to me. ""But in the darkest hours, on the coldest nights, when I felt I’d lost everything, I still had your letters. And through them, in some small way, I still had you. I loved you then, my darling Penelope, more than I could imagine—just as I love you now, more than you can know."" Perfect! Sure, she was to be a duchess. But being Bourne's marchioness doesn't seem so bad. They were perfect for each other and I loved them!",38,10

So, many of these Regency Era books have the formula of a marriage first, then a love story where the husband and wife fall in love. This is one of those tales.

stop hitting yourself Or, is it perhaps that all of these romance novels give us a false idea that if we could change them, they would be the best husband/boyfriend ever?Here's the thing, though. These books are fiction. Men don't really change. Sure, they can grow-up and become better husbands and fathers than their younger self would have been. But, if a guy is a raging asshole with major anger-management problems - he's going to stay a raging asshole with anger-management problems. ok, ok, most guys don't change!!And, that's my lesson for today.Oh, and by the way, this book is cute and funny.",38,4

""Do you plan to smother me with your muff?""""You, sir, are not a gentleman.""""Ah. Truth at last.""I loved the writing and I loved the story! Set in 1831, we meet Penelope and Bourne. They were childhood friends but they have been estranged since Bourne lost everything in a card game ten years ago. He has rebuilt his wealth through a gaming hell and when his former lands are attached to Penelope’s dowry he returns.I loved Penelope! She is sound and she is funny. She takes the whole kidnapped to marriage in stride and I just adored her. Often the hero is the book, but in this one Penelope is just as important. She wants adventure. Some books are too good for words! It is a marriage-of-convenience fake-betrothal friends-to-lovers story. And it is set in beautiful winter. I could feel the setting. It is alive and colorful! I loved the ice skating on the lake, the roasted chestnuts and the roulette. Every character is fabulous and I cannot wait for the next one!  ",38,30
10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,KatLynne,547,553,5,"June 3, 2012","Sarah MacLean has become one of my favorite HR authors. I enjoy her writing style and I find myself highlighting nearly every three or four pages. It’s like, “Oh my, I just love how she said that,” and I have to stop and do the Kindle highlight thing:) I crave dialogue in my novels and this one doesn’t disappoint! It is sexy, witty, poignant and refreshing! While there are a few places that could be referred to as “cheesy,” it still worked for me and I loved it!The young Michael, Marquess of Bourne, has lost EVERYTHING with the turn of a card! He’d been fleeced! He walks away with little more than his disgraced title. At the age of twenty one, Bourne’s entire life becomes full of hatred and he vows revenge and restitution. For the next nine years, that is what fuels his every decision. He is now one of four partners in London’s most exclusive Gaming Hells and is richer by far than most. Still, it is not enough. The only thing he wants more than his former home, Falconwell, is to destroy the one who took it from him. Penelope Marbury was first introduced in the third installment of SM’s Love By Numbers Trilogy. The scandal that led up to her father breaking her engagement to the Duke of Leighton has ruined her chances of a good match. Even though she is innocent of any wrongdoing, broken engagements were always blamed on the woman. Once considered the most darling of darlings of the ton, now, years later, she finds herself a spinster with a family desperate to see her wed. But Penelope wants MORE! This compassionate and smart young woman yearns to be wanted and loved. But it seems an impossible goal. Her father insists she must marry. Recently winning Falconwell in a card game, he places this property as part of her dowry, hoping this will attract more suitors.And so begins the journey of Penny and Michael. They were childhood friends until the loss of his estates. She hasn’t seen or heard from him since his defeat. Obtaining Falconwell is the only thing that gives him purpose and he doesn’t care who gets hurt in the process. He ruthlessly pursues Penny ensuring their marriage. Penny quickly learns the boy she once knew is gone and doesn’t recognize this hard and bitter man. And once again her choices are taken from her …by a man.Penny’s life as well as most women of the day has been ruled by the demands and whims of men; first her father, then as Leighton’s fiancé, and now Michael. Now, she is trapped by a man once again.  I liked this woman. She transforms into a beautiful, smart young lady who stands up for herself. She desires adventure and is no longer satisfied to settle for pastels! Michael, “wicked as sin and twice as handsome” has her heart yearning for so much more! And he soon finds himself no longer able to resist his desire for Penny.  “I am going to explore you…to discover your heat and softness, every bit of your decadence.” ….”You make my mouth water.”  He loved the taste of her, a “drug of which he could never have enough.”I loved this book - The sensual pull, the banter between these two, the laugh out loud moments, and the heartbreak of unrequited love and a heart that cannot get past feelings of unworthiness. And still, so, so much more than I’ve stated! Sarah MacLean had me so invested I didn’t want to stop until the end! And with the teaser added for the next installment, I can hardly wait!",34,28
10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,Dinjolina,526,497,2,"March 30, 2012","The books started out fabulously. It was solid, fun, witty, and angsty.I was sure it will be perfect!And it was, up untill about half way trough. Then it was just flat. Not bad, per se...but almost boring. It seemed like after the hero's turn-around everything was done in a straight line. Even the famous card scene with the heroine and the eeeeevil enemy left me cold.Also, a lot of things were never adressed. Like Mrs.Worth. The very young servats. The mistress-should-live-here-not-a-normal-family type of their house. And their future sleeping arrangements.All in all, the book could have been grand, but crumbled under pressure and angsty brooding (drama non-)goodness.",34,6
10428803,A Rogue by Any Other Name,Somia,"2,049",120,4,"November 25, 2020","This book was a delightful treat, the type of book you want to curl up with as you a transported away. There’s a richness to this story that was unexpected, and which ensured I was engrossed.In this story MacLean gives us Michael, Marquees of Bourne, who in a night of gambling and betrayal at the age of 21 lost all, and gained a deep thirst for revenge and a drive to gain back all that he had lost. Then there is strong and intelligent Lady Penelope Marbury, Michael’s childhood friend but also someone he uses in his driving need for revenge. Watching the conflict and tension in Michael as his desire for Penelope and all she promised clashed with his longing for revenge was overall riveting, MacLean knows how to draw the reader in.This is an interesting book, written well, with MacLean taking the bones of a story we have seen before and creating a story with depth, and which has you rooting for Michael and Penelope, individually and as a couple.Looking forward to reading the second book in the series.",31,6
