Rogers,psychology,"['Nonfiction', 'Philosophy', 'Self Help', 'Counselling', 'Spirituality', 'Mental Health']",4.24,"January 1, 1980",395,['N/A'],"A profound and deeply personal collection of essays by renowned psychologist Carl RogersThe late Carl Rogers, founder of the humanistic psychology movement and father of client-centered therapy, based his life's work on his fundamental belief in the human potential for growth. A Way of Being was written in the early 1980s, near the end of Carl Rogers's career, and serves as a coda to his classic On Becoming a Person. More philosophical than his earlier writings, it traces his professional and personal development and ends with a prophetic call for a more humane future.","""Experience is, for me, the highest authority. The touchstone of validity is my own experience. No other person's ideas, and none of my own ideas, are as authoritative as my experience. It is to experience that I must return again and again, to discover a closer approximation to truth as it is in the process of becoming in me."" -Carl Rogers, On Becoming a PersonDEVELOPED THEORIES - THERAPIESPerson-Centered; Humanistic; Client-Centered; Student-CenteredTIMELINE 1902 - Carl Rogers was born in Oak Park, Illinois.1919 - Enrolled at University of Wisconsin.1924 - Graduated from University of Wisconsin and enrolled at Union Theological Seminary.1926 - Transferred to Columbia.1931- Earned Ph.D. from Columbia.1940 - Began teaching at University of Ohio.1946 - Elected president of American Psychological Association (APA).1951 - Published Client-centered Therapy.1961 - Published On Becoming A Person.",71,961,103,2490,"['1160 (46%)', '868 (34%)', '370 (14%)', '76 (3%)', '16 (<1%)']"
