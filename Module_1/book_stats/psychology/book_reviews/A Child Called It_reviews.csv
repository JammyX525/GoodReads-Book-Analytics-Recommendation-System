60748,A Child Called It,Laura,385,504,1,"March 4, 2010","This book is very likely made up from start to finish. The events in it read like Pelzer imagined the worst child abuse possible and then said, ""And it all happened to me!"" Yeah, right. His brother and grandmother said in an interview that it was all rubbish, too, which casts more doubt upon the whole thing. Pelzer also bought his own book in bulk so the sales numbers would put it on the bestseller list -- he just doesn't have a whole lot of credibility. Perhaps worse than the fact that Pelzer is, shall we say, probably somewhat fluid with the truth, is the fact that he's a dreadful writer. I no longer own the book (didn't put it through a shredder, like I did with ""A Million Little Pieces,"" but I got rid of it as quickly as I could), so I can't list any examples here, but I do recall that I've seen better writing in sixth-grade themes.********After deleting I don't know how many comments calling me names, I'm adding this note, because it will save both me and a bunch of other people from wasting time: I'll delete any comments that I consider abusive or that I think constitute ad hominem arguments, so do keep that in mind if you're thinking about composing a long screed. Thanks. ",422,308
60748,A Child Called It,Eric,118,48,2,"March 10, 2008","this book was the 'hostel', or 'saw IV' of memoirs. i don't really know why i read it. it was free, first of all. and, i guess like any normal human being, i cannot look away from a trainwreck. 'a child called it' is not very well written. you walk away with more questions than you do answers. you don't really learn anything. you do, however, come away with having read some very disturbing and disgusting passages that describe in detail a case of horrendous child abuse. i'm not exactly sure what the book's intention is. it doesn't work very well as a memoir. there is no advice that would put this in any sort of self-help category. and if its intention is to provide hope to victim's of abuse, i don't know what the take-away is other than 'if i lived through this, you can live through just about anything'. i really don't know what to make of this book, as a piece of literary work. it's not much of one -- i don't know if it ever set out to be one. you get little, if any, insight into the dynamics of the brothers. you read one moment that the narrator hates his father, then loves his father, then hates his father. you read that the narrator cannot remember the color of his mother's hair or eyes, yet he describes in great detail many settings, images, etc. you really don't get any insight into the mother's descent into mental illness and alcoholism. one day she's the best, most loving mother in the world, the next she is straight out of a bosch painting. you get a feeling that pelzer is being very selective with what he shares with us. characters are never anything but inherently good or inherently evil. he's either being abused horribly or being embraced lovingly. there seems to be very little grey area in pelzer's book. the grey area is exactly what needs to be illuminated in a book about abuse. we learn far more from a book about becoming an alcoholic than we do from a book about being a drunk. the latter is voyeuristic and exploitive, the former can illuminate and possibly save lives.there has been quite a bit of controversy surrounding the accuracy of this book. i can't speak to that. there is a blurb about the book being up for the pulitzer at some point -- pelzer submitted it himself, which anyone can do. details like this do nothing but add an aura of snake oil -- the dime-store self-help book jacket design doesn't help matters. the last thing i'd want to do is come down on a dude who's lived through the type of hellish abuse described here. even if his descriptions were 1/10th true, it would still be more than any human being should have to endure. i am not claiming that this guy did not suffer, but we need more from books than a simple retelling of events. we get that in the newspaper every morning.

60748,A Child Called It,TK421,551,255,2,"December 4, 2013","This book was horrible. Period. A waste of my time. You see, what really pisses me off with this book is this: I have known kids that have come from horribly abusive situations that are more genuine than Pelzer is in his ""memoir."" The stories of his life in this book contradict one another, are extremely over-the-top and, dare I say, fabricated some. Now, before anyone wants to crucify me, look at the facts:His family members were interviewed and stated that this was pure fantasy. (I can concede that the family members may have lied.)He bought numerous copies of his own book to inflate sales records so that the book would have a better chance at getting on bestseller lists. (Again, I can concede that he was only helping his writing along by wanting his book to be seen by a greater audience.)However, and here is the kicker for me, if this story is true, then shouldn't just writing it and getting the story told redemption enough for Pelzer? A story of this magnitude should be told, there's no doubt about that. But it should be told with grace and humility. Pelzer should have approached this book as an avatar to the thousands of other kids out there that don't have a voice. Instead, Pelzer grandstands and makes the issue of child abuse seem like a sensationalistic piece of family trivia. Very disappointing.WASTE OF TIME",212,76
60748,A Child Called It,Briynne,585,52,5,"July 19, 2007","Easily the most terrifying book I've ever read. I think I had literally repressed the memory of it, until I randomly happened across the title this week. I experienced this book in a fairly odd way, during a week-long cheerleading camp my sophomore year of high school. My coach was reading it and somehow ended up reading the entire book aloud to my squad during breaks and at night. Once she started, we were all addicted and spent every free moment listening with rapt and horrified attention. I remember with almost painful clarity the way in which we sat at her feet listening to this story of a boy who endured a long childhood of astonishing, sadistic abuse at the hands of his mother. Girls were crying for long stretches, and not being a crier myself, I listened in a sort of shell-shocked, wide-eyed paralysis. After every single part of the reading, I was convinced it couldn't get worse, that she couldn't possibly do anything worse to that little boy. And every single time I was wrong. I'm not sure I would actually recommend this book or not. It is good - very good - but reads with the sort of harrowing inhumanity of a Holocaust memoir. Not light reading, and not a feel-good ""I survived the odds"" story. It kind of just makes you want to go home and tell your parents that you love them, and then bawl your eyes out. ",144,12
60748,A Child Called It,`. kateelynn *,4,12,5,"April 8, 2008","Oh my god, what can I possibly say about this book? When I first started reading this book last year, I was just so hooked to it and I just wanted to know everything about this book. It was all about this author's childhood gone horrible with the extreme abuse, the torture and suffering. I really couldn't believe my eyes, the author described like, everything he went through, all the pain he had to go through, how he felt and everything. I could really understand how he felt but one thing about this book I don't get at all is how his own mother transformed from a loving mother to a nightmarish, abusive mother so quickly. I mean, the author was only, like a little boy when his mother started abusing him.This book is extremely emotional and can make you feel so bad for the author and even cry so. This book was all about the author's childhood and how he survived through such abuse, starvation, and neglect. This also showed how bad things happen to good people - the author's own father didn't even help out at all - he was once a fun, loving fireman, turned into an alcoholic, carless father. The only way for the author to get help was through school but the only thing that kept him from telling the school the truth was his fear of his mother going after him and make his life last through hell forever; even though the school sort of already knew, from all the bruises on him, him stealing the children's food because of hunger, from his mother starving the author and how he constantly uses identical/unreasonable lies about his bruises and wounds. He was pratically stabbed in the belly and had to go through such pain. His faith and hope kept him going & he never let his mother win this sick game. In the end, he told the school the truth and he was finally taken out of the horrible home, with the abusive mother, two brothers that weren't treated horribly at all and the careless, alcoholic father - and put into a much better home - foster home. I loved this first book so much that I even continued on to the next book!A lot of thanks goes to my teacher, for lending me the books - it's one of my most favorites!",67,12
60748,A Child Called It,Rebecca,"4,549",177,2,"June 2, 2008","I've sat with this book on my desk for a couple weeks, unable to decide what I would write for a review. I'm wholly torn between this being one of my most-asked-for and least-favorite-ever titles. I wish the amount of times I heard ""this was the first book I liked"" (and the amount of times it's been billed/stolen from the library) corresponded to its quality, but I truly found it very short on redeeming qualities. Eric's Goodreads review says pretty much what I would say. The writing was cliched and the ""plot"" moved along by way of ""one day,"" ""one Sunday,"" or ""later."" There was never any explanation attempted for the mother's instant transformation from idyllic homemaker to savage abuser (unless you are supposed to infer that it's alcohol's fault, in which case, talk a little about alcoholism). There is absolutely no process of recovery or explanation or psychological background, and the book leaves huge questions open, saying ""Please understand that many of your questions will be answered in the next two books in the trilogy series."" That made me want to throw it across the room. It's a great marketing gimmick for fiction, but not for a supposedly true story. That kind of self-exploitation leaves a bad taste in my mouth. As for ""truth,"" the NYTimes article ""Dysfunction for Dollars"" sheds some very interesting light on Dave's story:http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage... All that being said, I am going to try to take this book for what it is: an excellent awareness-raiser about child abuse; a survival story that may help many think ""if he can get through that, I can get through anything""; and a simple, quick, can't-look-away-from-the-train-wreck read that kids and teens have given a cult following. May they then move on to something better. ",63,17
60748,A Child Called It,Sammy,207,860,5,"March 28, 2008","Okay, this is going to be a short and sweet review since it's a non-fictional autobiography and you can't really critique things like characters and story. But I'm going to say what I can...This book was a hard one to read yet I couldn't put it down. There's a different something in Dave's story that will keep different people reading. Mine was: Why? I wanted to know why his mother did this. I wanted to know what made her do it. I wanted to know how she could to it. And I wanted to know why it was Dave she picked out of him and his brothers. What made Dave the one she singled out for such monstrous torture. But that's something people involved in child abuse cases ask themselves every day.You really do feel for Dave. You don't feel with him because there are moments so bad that he has to disconnect himself. I couldn't do that while reading it though. I almost felt that if I could send my anger and frustration and sadness and hope out there it would stop. Of course it was foolish of me seeing as it happened many years ago and he's a grown man who escaped his mothers claws.I was only annoyed by the fact that the book was too short and that dividing his story into three seperate books seemed unnecessary. Especially because by the end the reader has become so invested in Dave and feels like they're such a part of his life, they want to go with him as he continues on to the next, hopefully happier chapter in his life. Perhaps it was a publishers marketing scheme to get more money or something. Goodness knows it wasn't Dave's. His goal was to tell his story, thank those who helped him, and open a door to shed light on an issue that is often hidden away. All of which he accomplished magnificently.What we learn in Dave's story is that child abuse is real. It comes in many forms, but it's out there and it's up to those of us in the lives of children to stand up and be the voice for the abused. Another thing we learn is to not back down in that fight, of course there will be road blocks, but if you champion for a child as those special people in Dave's life did, you can help. You can save a life, heart, and soul. You can give a child hope.This book is a must-read I'd say. I of course went out and got the follow-up (I hate to use the word sequel with something like this) and read it right away. That's a review to follow later. If you are debating about reading this book I will just say that it is a hard read. If you're a mother it will probably be especially hard. If you have a deep compassion and love for children it will probably be hard. If you yourself have experienced abuse it will probably be hard. If you just have a heart it will be hard. But don't give up. It would be even harder to just quit in the middle, trust me on that. It's that end, despite being a beginning, that will bring tears to your eyes and a much needed smile to your face.",55,5
60748,A Child Called It,Rebbie,141,110,5,"February 9, 2017","I've been avoiding this book since I was a teenager. I did so because this is a trigger for me and I knew I couldn't handle it. But...I figured that it's been two years since I cut my mother out of my life and that I finally feel free. And strong... well, at least strong enough to face each day. That's got to be better than nothing.Anyway, this isn't about me so instead I'll say that no matter what, I'm glad I read it. I feel I have a duty to face other true stories of horrific child abuse, if only to put on the armor of bravery and show children that they don't need to run from the horror of their abuser's glee; that life can be good and it can feel somewhat safe. That they can save themselves like I did and that all the pain, isolation and fear that consumes and suffocates them can break the barrier down and leave them with a profound sense of compassion, forgiveness and love for the very monsters who made/make us feel like they are powerful enough to stop the universe.If you're reading this review and you've been abused/neglected/raped and/or forced to endure any other type of horror, KNOW THIS:Dont give up. Don't let them win. Even if we never understand why they chose us and not our sibling (s), it's ok. We don't need all the answers. We just need to love ourselves and each other enough to let the light shine in. Everything will be ok. I promise. ",46,11
60748,A Child Called It,Misty Marie Harms,559,278,4,"February 21, 2022","This has been one of the hardest books I have ever read. The amount of abuse this so-called mother (womb provider) put this child through is unthinkable. If there is a hell, I hope this human garbage has a space reserved in the hottest section. Oh, don't think I have forgotten about David's father (sperm donor). He needs to have a seat next to her. If anything, he is worse. He knew what his son was going through and CHOSE to ignore it. CHOSE not to provide a safe place for his child. I hope David has found all the love and happiness in this world. He deserves it.",41,4
60748,A Child Called It,☽•☾-Grimalkin-☽•☾,51,93,2,"February 22, 2021","Please note: Before I get into this review I want to make it very clear that I believe that David Pelzer was abused and did go through serious trauma as a child. However, by allowing this book to be published and available to the public, he has given room for the details of the abuse suffered, to be open to speculation. Warning of Spoilers.A Child Called It was written 1995, is a first-hand account of the abuse Pelzer suffered from the ages of 4 to 12, at the hands of his alcoholic mother. He describes how his mother withheld food and starved him, forced him to drink ammonia (I have reservations about this which I will get into later), stabbed him in the stomach (again, I am wondering about this), burned his arm on a hot stove, forced him to eat vomit and excrement and locked him in the bathroom which a mix of chemicals which he had to inhaled, repeatedly gassing himself, until he vomited blood and passed out (I seriously question the validity of this event).David also mentions in the book that his father did nothing to stop the abuse from happening, eventually leaving home, letting Dave battle with this mother alone. My opinionI have one or two serious reservation about the validity of David's recanting of the abuse he suffered. I don't understand how David simply didn't die at the hands of his mother. He describes not being fed for 10 days which I find very hard to believe as he was already malnourished. 10 days without food for a young child, you are running into organ failure and death. Leading on from this point I personally believe he exaggerated the details of other events such as:The drinking of ammonia, which will KILL a adult, never mind a starved, abused child, I have no doubt that if this was to have occurred his mouth and throat would have been seriously burnt, as would his stomach and liver. 100% would have required medical attention to stop further damage.The stabbing incident which apparently his mother has enough sense in her drunken state to have the medical skill to know how to be able to repair a stab wound to the stomach without having David permanently physically disabled, bleed out and die. The ""gas chamber"" punishment, this boggled my mind. David states that he vomited blood and passed out due to a lack of oxygen. How he didn't suffocate and sustain serious mental damage is nothing short of a miracle in my mind!!!!My last point on this is that David recalls the events that occurred with incredible clarity. This is why I believe he has massively exaggerated some points of this book. Trauma plays tricks on the brain, especially on a child's brain. A child who has undergone as horrific treatment as David described most likely won't be able to remember all the events described. If he did exaggerate or fabricate some of the incidents then this would explain the large amounts of detail.At the end of the day, what needs to be remembered is that A Child Called It has given voice to all the cases of child abused which otherwise would have gone unheard. It raised flaws in the social service system and highlighted how little we know of what goes on for children behind closed doors.That is truly powerful and explains why I gave the book at least some stars even though I question the validity of his claims. Pelzer has also written several other books on his experiences with abuse including:The Lost Boy written in 1997A Man Named Dave written in 2000Moving Forward written in 20092/5",38,2
60748,A Child Called It,Laurel,398,170,2,"May 3, 2009","YIKES. This is a man's account of the severe abuse he suffered as a young child through the hands of his mother. Apparently, there is some doubt on whether the story is actually true, or whether the author merely made the whole thing up. I don't know enough about the controversy to speculate, so I will just give the author the benefit of the doubt and assume this is indeed a factual memoir of his childhood. If that is the case, then he most certainly deserves major admiration for having overcome such incredible adversities and for sharing his story. That being said, this book is very poorly written. It is essentially just one description of one abusive incident after another, and nothing more. There's no real introspection, and no explanation as to how he later found forgiveness, or why the mother was once a kind, loving parent and suddenly one day just went completely mad. A book that describes overcoming any kind of extreme hardship, ending with a message about hope and the ability of the human spirit to triumph, can be both moving and inspiring. However, a book that merely describes abuse in vivid detail one scene after another and does little else? Just plain depressing.",35,9

60748,A Child Called It,Reading_ Tamishly,"3,930",2160,4,"May 2, 2021","Ever read a non-fiction that ends with a cliffhanger?Well, this is one and had me going frantically searching for it's sequel. And blessed be the book, it became mine asap. This memoir is one heartbreaking read narrating in details about the physical and emotional abuse of Dave Pelzer ever since he was 7 years old. Things never became better for this boy. His only hope, his dad, left him too unable to bear the taunts of his wife. I never would have thought how cruel and evil a mother can be towards her child. This has got to be one of the worst cases of child abuse I would ever read. I totally agree with the author that what's worse than the abuser is the one who was supposed to save you as the one silently watching you suffer and not doing anything about it. This is one of the best, hard-hitting memoirs I have ever read. But I do not understand the idea of leaving it so incomplete without a proper ending. Yes, I have to read the sequel to know how he got rescued.I appreciate how the book is written so well and cleverly for that matter.You can actually feel what he as a child went through. You really want to help him but as a reader you are so helpless. And moreover you know he would survive through it all. But you cannot help feeling broken each moment Dave became more broken. It's his strength and the will to survive each day and not his 'weakness' (as he used to feel) that makes this memoir so powerful. I do not read such memoirs to make myself feel better knowing how previledged I am or how lucky I am. But I do choose to read such memoirs and such books to know how we as human show our worse ways and be the worse as we can be. On the other hand, I come to know how we as human can deal with the worst possible conditions and how we can come out of such situations rather than cursing our fates. I am so thankful to the author for such a powerful memoir. (I deliberately left out any event or the details regarding the abuse in this review. I feel it is the right of the author to reveal or not regarding any information.)",32,6
60748,A Child Called It,Tina,"2,302",1 follower,5,"October 10, 2020","This is a Biography Memoir/Non-fiction, and this is the first book in the Dave Pelzer series. This is a very short and quick read. I really loved this book, but the subject of this book is hard to read. The way the book is written is easy to read, but the subject is not of people that gets upsets by hard to read subjects. My childhood was not great, and I had a Mother that had mental health issues and she did drugs/drink way to much. I was very lucky because I had a strong Grandmother that would not back down. My Grandmother always show up when things got bad because she stopped by our house on the way home everyday. She know something was going on. When I told my Grandmother I did not want to live with my parents anymore at the age of 10 years old. She went to mother and told her she was taking me to her house. She got my Mother to sign some paperwork two days later, and I never know what it was until I was 18 years old. It turns out my Grandmother give my mother her land for me. To this day I love my Grandmother with all my heart for want she did to save me. I wish someone strong will took on this child's mother. I also wonder while reading this book if the mother in this book had mental health issues, but I am not saying that gives her any reason to do what she did. What also made me love my Grandmother is she did not turn her back on my Mother that needed help. My mother was my Grandmother's daughter-in-law, so she did not have to do anything for her. But, I also learn when I was 15 years old my Grandmother checked on my Mother everyday after she took me to school. My Grandmother told me that my mother was sick and needed help to, and she could never turn her back on someone that needed help. I started to help my Grandmother take care of my mother when I was 16 until I was 20 years old. I stopped when I was 20 years old because my Mother took her own life. I do not have a lot of good memories of the time I lived with my mother, but I have found peace. I hope that this child finds peace, and I wish with all my heart that any child going through this has an adult that is strong and welling to stand up for them. ",31,10
60748,A Child Called It,Carrie,306,21,3,"June 23, 2008","I know it's not nice to burn, stab, poison, starve or otherwise torture your kid, but damn! If THAT can't motivate a boy to do the dishes in less than half an hour, how's he ever gonna learn?! Seriously, though. I'm enjoying this short little autobiography from a ""glad it wasn't me"" perspective. The only problem is I can't believe a book so poorly edited became a New York Times Bestseller. The man uses commas like they're going out of style and uses ""everyday"" instead of ""every day."" [Everyday is an adjective, as in ""Storms were becoming an everyday occurrence."" Every day should be used when you are talking about the frequency of an event, as in ""It rained every day during our vacation.""] On one page, I found three grammatical errors. And these pages are small, with large type!P.S. Now that I am finished reading it and have read some other reviews of the book on Goodreads, plus a NY Times article linked from another Goodreads review, I am inclined to believe the author is a liar. The article suggests that the book's lengthy stay on the NYT bestseller list is due to the author's habit of purchasing thousands of copies at a time (at a discount) and selling them at his speaking engagements. He also tells everyone who listens that ""A Child Called It"" was nominated for a Pulitzer, when it really wasn't. Submitted for review, maybe. Plus, how are you going to believe someone can recall graphic scenes from their childhood, but not what their mother looked like? Would have been nice if the Times reporter had interviewed the teachers who reported his abuse (if, in fact those people and reports weren't fabricated) or if the reporter had looked for the police report taken when Pelzer was removed from his home. The brother, Stephen, says David was removed for setting fires or something... It's not quite fair to leave it as a he-said-she-said when there are documents of the event out there.",27,10
