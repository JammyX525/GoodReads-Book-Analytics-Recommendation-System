76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Martha,277,37,5,"April 15, 2008","What is so powerful about this book is not that there is much new material here. We’ve all heard about how the ego keeps us chained to our judgements, fears, and desires. The difference is in how the author explains his points. Finally, we understand! Wouldn’t you love it if all the stuff you’ve read about enlightenment suddenly became crystal clear? (I see you all nodding!) This is it.Throughout the entire book, he reiterates the same points. He does not offer ‘instructions’. Here’s a great example-how to let go of attachment. “Don’t even try. It’s impossible. Attachment to things drops away by itself when you no longer seek to find yourself in them.”My copy is frilled with flags (the best Christmas present I got last year was a flag dispenser!). There is so much you’ll want to remember that once you have finished it, you will find yourself picking it up at odd times and leafing through it. You’ll find a page and read something, and  it will resonate. Here’s the author’s summary: “Enjoyment of what you are doing, combined with a goal or vision that you work toward, becomes enthusiasm. Even though you have a goal, what you are doing in the present moment needs to remain the focal point of your attention; otherwise, you will fall out of alignment with universal purpose. Make sure your vision or goal is not an inflated image of yourself and therefore a concealed form of ego, such as wanting to become a movie star, a famous writer, or a wealthy entrepreneur. Also make sure your goal is not focused on having this or that, such as a mansion by the sea, your own company, or ten million dollars in the bank. An enlarged image of yourself or a vision of yourself having this or that are all static goals and therefore don’t empower you. Instead, make sure your goals are dynamic, that is to say, point toward an activity that you are engaged in and through which you are connected to other human beings as well as to the whole. Instead of seeing yourself as a famous actor and writer and so on, see yourself inspiring countless people with your work and enriching their lives. Feel how that activity enriches or deepens not only your life but that of countless others. Feel yourself being an opening through which energy flows from the unmanifested Source of all life through you for the benefit of all. All this implies that your goal or vision is then already a reality within you, on the level of mind and of feeling. Enthusiasm is the power that transfers the mental blueprint into the physical dimension. That is the creative use of mind, and that is why there is no wanting involved. You cannot manifest what you want; you can only manifest what you already have. You many get what you want through hard work and stress, but that is not the way of the new earth.”All I can say is read it, and watch your life change!",236,17
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Liz,29,1 follower,5,"March 13, 2008","Oprahmercial. Well if you can over look that aspect I highly recommend this book. Tolle's penmanship allows difficult philosophical, psychological principles to come together simplified. This book simplifies complex notions of western approaches with an eastern point of view on metaphysics. I think it is a helpful tool for those cynical about the current state of humanity. I also believe it could be a great entry book into Eastern philosophy. He seems to Americanize complex metaphysical approaches of being thereby creating access. Oprah is a maverick bookseller and I can say that this is one of her greatest gifts to her audiences. She has found a tool to help readers enable their greater selves. I am deeply grateful that this book is available to the masses. Tolle brilliantly takes many philosophical backbones to task by incorporating them in layman’s terms. The more philosophy, Western and Eastern is accessible to the masses the better off we will all be. This book is trying to do just that and I can say Tolle accomplishes the goals set for in the writings. If one is familiar with eastern concepts of spirituality this book will reinforce the ideas, if one is familiar with basic psychology and western philosophy one will be pleasantly reminded of the insights into human nature. I would buy this book and give it to everyone who comes to me with existenal anxiety and seeking answers about the purpose of their life. One notion reinforced in this book is that these answers are not out side of you but are within yourself. This is a difficult concept to practice, especially for Americans in that our culture reinforces the notion that acquisition of external means will lead to internal gratification. It brings me great joy to know that Tolle’s efforts are reaching millions, which Oprah is trying to teach this enlightenment and that for once someone is using their media means for the greater good. Sometimes the best books state concepts that you are unable to articulate. This book does this for me. At the end of my philosophy studies I wanted to seek out reconciliation between eastern ideas and western ideologies this book successfully does this with an amazing ease. Tolle is an enlightened man and even more impressive is when he said he didn’t want to be, or become a guru. This made me respect his mind even more. He is a gifted intellect and is doing a great service for humanity by this text. If one wants more than a self help book, tired of Zen lyrics that seem to dissipate after reading them and wants a breath of fresh air to challenge your cynicism in the current state of humanity this book will satisfy. This book is soul food. I like reading what is extremely popular becuase it seems to let you believe you are connecting with many minds at once. Instead of being locked in your own consciousness. This book creates the bridge towards the path of connecting to the ",140,11
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Madeline,184,18,3,"May 20, 2008","ok, i'm about half way through. first thing i notice is this guy is pretty long-winded. it took him 127 pages to tell me that the ego is the source of all the earths problems. Anything you feel or think or say comes from the ego. and thats a bad thing. we all need to be ""enlighted"" and gain ""awareness"" of our ""presence."" heres a nice quote from the book: ""Enlightened collectives will fulfill an important function in the arising of the new consciousness. Just as egoic collectives pull you into unconsciousness and suffering, the enlightened collective can be a vortex for consciousness that will accelerate the planetary shift."" ... what the hell is he talking about?!?here's another one: ""Every ego is therefore schizophrenic, to use the word in its popular meaning of split personality. You live with a mental image of yourself, a conceptual self that you have a relationship with. Life itself becomes conceptualized and separated from who you are when you speak of ""my life."" The moment you say or think ""my life"" and believe in what you are saying (rather than it just being a linguistic convention), you have entered the realm of delusion."" ... huh??he then goes on to say ""For example, it is likely you won't feel any emotion when you are told that someon's car has been stolen, but when it is *your* car, you will probably feel upset. It is amazing how much a little mental concept like ""my"" can generate. - - so, only b/c i had this insane mental concept of something being ""mine"" is the reason i was upset when susan g. price took my car. at least i'm aware now that that feeling was just my ego so i can release it and it won't add any density to my ""pain-body""come on...ok i finished it. and i think he maybe sorta kinda won me over at the end...at least, i think i get what he was trying to say and like it I appreciate his respect and appreciation for religion and religious leaders (ie: Buddha, Jesus Christ and various Zen Masters)He basically says everything we do on this earth is secondary to our primary purpose of Being, and having a oneness with the universe. He encourages us to focus on that beingness, to breathe, to be fully present in every moment. He then goes on to say that just b/c this earth is not our primary goal, that doesn't meant that there is no purpose to life. Our purpose is whatever we are doing at any present moment. don't live for the future, don't dwell on the past. Do whatever you're doing to the best of your ability and with all your being, even if that means just typing this out. this is what my purpose is right now. He also says to recognize our ego for what it is. It's not who we are. The feelings other people have about us, the feelings we have about ourselves, they don't matter in the grand scheme of things. they aren't real. they're created. they don't affect our Beingness.with all that said though, he still comes across as a kook, his writing style is terrible and he blabs on and on and on. i think he's got some good ideas, but unfortunately he's not gonna change the world with this book.and i feel like i've already found all he teaches in Orthodoxy.",62,10
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Jen,149,10,5,"August 15, 2010","To me, this book is pretty much a great overview on what is wrong with the world- the human ego. In a weird way, I regret ever having read this book because it opened my eyes so greatly to the hidden egocentric motivation behind every human thought and action that I can't stop seeing the underlying ego behind everything, and everyone, I encounter. I think this book should be required reading for everyone; the problem is, many people will read this book and see others in it, but not themselves. Today, more than ever, we are plagued by a culture where everyone is obsessed with being ""right"" and in the processing making everybody else ""wrong."" The level of hate that has become epidemic in modern society, particularly in politics, is a clear result of out-of-control egos clashing to reign supreme in self-righteous glory.I wish everyone took a moment in their day to question their thoughts and what the motivating factor is that drives them. That is the only way to truly recognize your own ego in action. As Mr. Tolle states, you'll never get rid of it, but my becoming more aware of it, it becomes easier to detach yourself from long-held beliefs that do not serve a greater purpose other than to give you a false illusion of who you think you are. Our attachment to this false illusion only serves to spew out superiority over others while contributing nothing in return. ",50,5
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,4,"June 9, 2021","There are a plethora of self-help books and new age spiritual awakening guides that all claim to have the power to change your life in a positive way; they all suggest a new way of thinking is required to alter your reality: they suggest that something more is needed to reach the next level of human consciousness. The problem with most of these books is that such ideas are extremely difficult to define accurately in words. They feel vague and often like they are scratching the surface of large concepts that they cannot quite grasp. Simply put, the writers cannot quite articulate their ideas well enough to their readers. Because how does one precisely describe the moment of an acute realisation? How to you encapsulate a spiritual awakening with words never mind pave the way to it? I believe Eckhart Tolle is one of the best in the business. His words are some of the closest I have read that describe such concepts. And this is because of his deep understanding of theology, which is not tarnished by dogma or prejudice. He understands the healing quality present in religion and he uses it in an attempt to teach mankind, to try and make him more awake. I enjoyed reading his ideas here, and I will keep reading his works to see what more wisdom he has to impart. __________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________",42,2
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Sarah,86,3,1,"August 17, 2008","I think that because I have what I feel is a strong faith, this book just didn't make a big impression. I feel like a lot of the ego stuff he was talking about is basically morals and values, of which if you already have a high regard for and were taught about them, then a new awakening to being good is sort of insulting.Anyone can be mindful for an instant, staying mindful, though, can be the work of a lifetime. I feel like Tolle has reduced himself to a shell of a person with no ego, no emotions, no thoughts, no past, no future in the mistaken view that somehow his detachment makes him a deeper, more spiritual being. Unfortunately, I see him as a social misfit who has managed to hypnotize himself with endless verbiage so that he doesn't have to face up to the pain and suffering that are a normal part of existence. I am happy for him that he was able to ""awaken"" and get out of his hell that contributed to his depression and attempted suicide, but to assume that he is enlightened and can now enlighten everyone else is too weird.Not that I know a lot about Buddhism, but this book is basically everything I did learn in a few classes about Eastern religions. Those scholars took thousands of years trying to teach enlightenment, and now Tolle is going to do it in one 300 pg book?If you ever read Viktor Frankl, he was teaching what it is to be awake, he learned this from being in the death camps in Nazi Germany and by watching those around him, who were survivors and who were dying...Man's Search for Meaning is a much better book to read about becoming whole and getting everything out of our lives. i read it last summer and have it if you want. Anyone, long review, did the group like it overall or not???",35,8
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Nataliya Yaneva,165,323,2,"June 21, 2019","A hotchpotch of New Age mumbo-jumbo with some psychological insights thrown in to knit the contents together. The story of Eckhart Tolle’s so called “awakening” following which he became a spiritual teacher is also strangely suspicious. I won’t say “scripted” because I’m always willing to give the benefit of the doubt, yet I’m less than half a believer. Maybe I’m just not actualized enough. Anyway, I’m not convinced that you will need a Mr. Tolle to know that a large portion of the human condition is defined by ego, identifying with your possessions, and the never-ending yearning to be somewhere else than the present moment. And that much of this is what gets people in trouble and makes us sink into a rut. I recommend taking a break from any source of information and actually thinking about your not so useful habits for 5 minutes per day for a week. It’ll be a lot more beneficial than ponding on the abstract wordings in Tolle’s book.",29,N/A

76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Jenell,50,3,4,"May 19, 2008","In A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose, Eckhart Tolle simply and beautifully employs spiritual parables from many traditions to distill and illuminate the One truth to which they point: God in me; me in God. Form (the material world) is interpenetrated by nothingness (space, quantum possibilities, consciousness, spirit, God). If so many cultures can agree that we, as form, are permeated with spirit, why do we experience so much separation and suffering? Tolle states that suffering is created when the ego identifies completely with form:1. Physical Forms: personal, socio and spiritual conditioning from the past (such as gender, social status and race), 2. Feeling Forms: accumulated emotional pain, and 3. Thought Forms: beliefs, expectations and judgments.“This results in total unawareness of my connectedness with the whole, my intrinsic oneness with every “other” as well as the Source. This forgetfulness is original sin, suffering and delusion.” Tolle posits that this forgetfulness creates a schism between what we perceive and the realm of possibilities—or spirit. This schism is the result of an outmoded egoic consciousness. Does that mean that ego is bad? We use this ego consciousness as a vehicle to identify with form. It’s how we experience and engage the world! It’s in this identification and mastery of form, that we find our security, certainty and power. Look at the vast possibilities we’ve created in our world: technological convenience, accessibility of information, sanitation, medical science, culture, etcetera. Tolle does not say that ego is bad, but suggests, however, that it’s no longer a necessary vehicle. Eckhart Tolle believes that it is imperative that our ego consciousness evolves. He doesn’t urge us to stop thinking—but to stop identifying with our thinking. Nor does he urge us to stop suffering, but to recognize it as a messenger to be conscious. How can we do that when we are suffering? Tolle offers an alternative to identifying and defending our old physical, feeling and thought forms. He calls this Awakened Doing and defines three modalities: acceptance, enjoyment and enthusiasm. If you are not in the state of at least one of them, no matter what you are doing, you are creating suffering for yourself or others. 1. Acceptance is to assume responsibility for your identification with beliefs, expectations and judgments. If you are living an old situation over and over in your thinking, you are not in the present. Bring your consciousness here. This is what you have control of. If you’ve relinquished your thoughts and still cannot accept what you’re doing—if it’s causing you suffering—stop. 2. To experience Enjoyment is to find the joy of conscious Presence in whatever you are doing. Instead of identifying with your feeling, obsessively wanting something or expecting joy to come from a certain activity, you bring yourself to the present moment. Perhaps in this moment, no matter how small, you are alive and alert. Practice this, and each moment will expand so that you begin to experience connection to the universal creative power. Joy flows from there into activities that were once tedious or painful, because a new consciousness is awakened in you. 3. Enthusiasm is the spiritual will or vision manifesting through you. To find your relationship to enthusiasm you must recognize how you are connected to the spirit. You are not your gender, title, cultural conditioning, or race.The result is the Earthly manifestation of Heaven. Awakening now is your life’s purpose! Eckhart Tolle is an articulate writer, and his ideas flow logically. The stories he chooses enliven the concepts he presents. I have two minor critiques of this book: 1) I wish the end-notes contained source references to all the stories—not just the Biblical references, and 2) It would have allowed me greater contemplation if he included pauses in his writing for personal discovery and practical applications. But, all-in-all, I thoroughly enjoyed A New Earth. ",25,12
76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Vonia,611,98,1,"October 5, 2015","I just spent the last five plus hours researching, reading this fucking Eckhart Tolle. What do I think? This is essentially the same book as The Power Of Now! The only valid point Tolle has is this: it is mentally unhealthy to obsess endlessly over things that we didn't cause in the past, and over things we can't control in the present, and over things that have no likelihood in the future. He doesn't need 220 pages to make that point. He doesn't need a book. He doesn't even need a whole page within a book. In fact his teachings can be very detrimental, since it is urging us to reduce the amount of time we spend planning for the future. Remember you are on this planet for a while, and most worthwhile things are created over a long period of time, and usually involves some aspect of long range planning and long term envisioning.Oh, right... none of that matters: either good luck falls from the sky and/or we can be murderers that are also drug addicts that are homeless and are being abused on a daily basis, sometimes multiple times, because the only thing that matters is that we are in an individual state of ""Being""... Remember, gullible audience, The Power Of Now!  He also advocates dropping the past immediately, which avoids putting sufficient time and attention into first acknowledging and accepting the past - and thereby learning from it before we discard it.  Basically, he wants people to stop thinking so much. With my most insincere apologies, I like to think. Yes. Imagine that.  Obviously, I agree with the idea that we should minimize the amount of time spent lamenting about the past & overdoing it with worrying about the future. But he takes it to a illogical, stupid, and, frankly, offensive level...  What he is saying is that ""We are nothing"" It does not matter. We should do nothing, anything, be nothing, anything, it is all the same... because nothing really matters except this ""state of being""... Fine, do not care about anything, be completely apathetic, detached and/or unfeeling- you know, we basically do not even know who we are. We could be anything.  Other things the ego will identify with in order to feel good include our work, social status, knowledge and education, physical appearance, belief systems, and also political, racial, nationalistic, religious or other collective identities. ""None of these is you,"" Tolle states. Oh I see. Obviously some of these I agree with to a certain extent, i.e., your work is not you, your race/looks/status mean much less than a lot of people often make it out to be... But belief systems? Values? Knowledge? Political beliefs? Are you fucking crazy, Tolle?????.... None of that matters? Oh, now I get it. Nothing matters. Then why don't you die right now? ""Being"" when you are in some fantasy bliss world when nothing besides your state is important would be great if it was actually possible (""Ignorance Is Bliss"")... But the only way this is humanly possible is to be subjected to solitary confinement from the moment of birth. Sorry Eckhart, but not all of us can wander around for years at a time, sleeping on park benches in a state of euphoria.  Plus... the cherry on top is The Oprah not only fully endorsing Tolls, but naming him the sole person to ever engage in a business partnership with the multi-million dollar The Great The One The Only The All Knowing Oprah Winfrey. With few exceptions, the stronger Oprah's support, the stupider it is.  Yes, I do realize that I may have been slightly overly harsh with Tolle. Like I explained earlier, I do believe and/or agree with most of the basic teachings... but there is no way that stands in this extreme end of the spectrum.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...

76334,A New Earth Awakening to Your Lifes Purpose,Michael,24,2,3,"February 29, 2008","Practically: spot-on treatment of the ego as problem source. Lots of advice that would be beneficial for most people.Philosophically: not rigorous, despite an implicit claim to be the next step following the path from Descartes through Sartre. Equivocal vocabulary lets him subtly draw questionable logical connections. Some metaphysical foundations are implicitly assumed. Notably missing is any treatment of ethics, or much in the way of implications at all. All in all, I am probably giving him too much credit considering one section is titled ""Incontrovertible Proof of Immortality"".Stylistically: too verbose and repetitive. Since he does a remarkable job of making a coherent case, some anecdotes could go missing or are off-the-mark. Reads like a self-help book.Spiritually: matches my own beliefs closely and in some cases explained myself to me. Reading such a verbose description of them provided me with tremendous food for thought. Tolle does not examine his premise that consciousness is inevitable, that it is woven into the fabric of the universe. Is this different from intelligent design? Finally, there wasn't much in the way of new ideas for me. I wish I was more knowledgable on the subject so I could tell what material here is distinct from a so-called ""Eastern Spirituality 101 for Christians"".",23,2

This is a book about how what we tell ourselves about our world (experiences, relationships, events) becomes our world, for good or bad. It also gives practical advice (if you're willing to hang in there) about how to transform your thinking so as to improve your life and truly live in the Now. Tolle pulls from every religious system out there, and introduces new (to me) perspectives on biblical passages and this may put off some readers. However I found that opening my mind to the possibilities transformed my thinking. It seemed that every time I grew weary of it and was on the verge of putting it down, I would come across a gem that resonated so significantly that it kept me reading.

I suspect it might be a little too theoretical to have much practical impact on my real life if I didn't have that background and training.
