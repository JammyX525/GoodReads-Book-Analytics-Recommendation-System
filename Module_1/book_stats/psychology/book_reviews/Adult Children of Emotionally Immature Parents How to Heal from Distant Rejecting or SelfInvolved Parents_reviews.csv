23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,Christina,230,12,4,"March 22, 2016","Agh! I want to give this book five stars soooo badly, but there is one thing holding me back. The book talks in detail about emotionally immature parents, and how to recognize the behaviors. It also talks at length about internalizing and externalizing as responses to those behaviors. What it doesn't talk about is recognizing those same emotionally immature behaviors in yourself, and what you can do to mature in those areas. Of course, we'll have reactions to the behaviors of our parents, but many of us adopted those same behaviors, and would like to avoid making those same mistakes in our relationships now. I would've loved a section just before the end summary of each section that had 2-3 concrete exercises to help not behave in those emotionally immature ways.Why does this seemingly small criticism knock it down a full star? Maybe I'm an extreme internalizer ;-) but I found it sometimes hard to focus on the sections about why I deserved more while I was too busy worrying, ""but I do that. And that! Oh no..."" But, that being said, it's absolutely worth reading, I loved it. It was so helpful and has a really good balance of non-emotionally identifying immature behaviors and offering new attitudes and behaviors. I am so hoping that there's a sequel about not falling into emotionally immature behaviors ourselves. ","1,012",51

I love this book so, so much. As anyone who has read my blog knows, I grew up with pretty awful (i.e., abusive) parents, so this book validated my experiences in such a profound way. I appreciate how Lindsey Gibson honors the emotional experience of growing up with an emotionally immature parent through her immense empathy and compassion. She makes space for the suffering and the painful yet necessary transformation of a helpless child to a self-aware adult. She writes like a warm therapist or friend who stands by your side, as opposed to a cold or detached professional. Throughout the book, she provides a ton of important research-based information too, like the four types of emotionally immature parents and various findings about attachment patterns.I most loved how Gibson provides specific, tangible strategies for improving your ability to handle difficult emotions as well as techniques to develop healthy, reciprocal relationships. I believe that everyone could benefit from reading these sections - and this book as a whole - as Gibson's insights apply to handling all emotionally immature people, not just parents. For example, she provides a thorough list of traits and behaviors of emotionally mature people at the end of the book that amazed me with its accuracy and understanding of humans.Ten out of five stars to this gem. I know I will come back to it both for my personal life and for my work as a mental health professional.",369,16

It's hard to review such a book without getting personal. I'm not interested in sharing my dirty laundry or my family's, but this book has completely changed my life. I learned I wasn't alone, and I learned many ""whys."" More importantly, beyond explaining the ""hows"" and ""whys,"" the author gave tools for interacting with family, finding and making new emotionally mature relationships, inner change, and more. I would pick up more of Gibson's work in a heartbeat. I'm eternally grateful.",231,6
23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,Morgan Blackledge,551,1851,5,"August 5, 2021","I avoided this one for a good minute. For some reason I just ‚Äòwasn‚Äôt in the mood‚Äô for it. But I‚Äôll be ding danged if it didn‚Äôt hit the bullseye üéØSometimes we (I) avoid the the best stuff, and go for the close but not quite thing, or even the wrong thing altogether. Funny how that works.And that‚Äôs kind of what this book is about. It‚Äôs about how being emotionally neglected in childhood, by an emotionally immature or self absorbed parent, can get you in the habit of ‚Äòputting out fire with gasoline‚Äô, and can keep you ‚Äòlookin for love in all the wrong places‚Äô (as an 80‚Äôs pop song can attest).How so you ask?Well you have to read the book to find out. But it ‚Äògoes a little something like this, hit it‚Äô.Author Lindsay Gibson defines emotionally immature parenting as typified by a pervasive inability to be present and attentive to the child‚Äôs emotional experiences.According to Gibson, emotionally immature, or self absorbed parents are blind to their children‚Äôs emotional word for a variety of reasons, most commonly due to their own abuse and neglect in childhood, as well as trauma, addiction, mental illness etc. Anyway, for what ever reason, the emotionally immature parent(s) can‚Äôt sooth or validate their children‚Äôs emotions. Left to fend for themselves, these emotionally neglected children may adopt an internalizing or externalizing coping style.Internalizing: refers to the tendency to seek emotional soothing by becoming self-reliant, and retreating inwardly e.g. utilizing psychological defenses and traits such as dissociation and/or creative fantasy for emotional comfort. Internalizers are vulnerable to trauma depression and anxiety, but are also prone to self awareness, insight and empathy.Externalizing: refers to the tendency to seek emotional soothing externally in relationships, objects and behaviors. Externalizers are vulnerable to substance use, emotional outbursts, vandalism, crime etc. but are also prone to hard driving high achievement.The author reports that internalizers are the ones that typically seek therapy voluntarily, often in their 30‚Äôs after a divorce or other relationship problems. But externalizers end up in therapy too, usually due to legal troubles or substance abuse etc. In both cases, children of emotionally immature parents ‚Äògrow up quickly‚Äô out of sheer necessity to take care of them selves, or to take care of their parents.In such cases, childhood offers little advantages and too many restrictions.These ‚Äòlittle grownups‚Äô speed towards adulthood and independence, but at a very high price that they only become aware of later in life. Growing up fast if exciting, but you miss out on important developmentally appropriate milestones and often find yourself behind your peers in someway or another. Children of emotionally immature parents frequently want to change the way their parents feel. But the author emphatically warns against this claiming ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt change someone who doesn‚Äôt want to change‚Äù.The author observers that children of emotionally immature parents often harbor a fantasy that if they can just engage emotionally with their parent, in just the right way, then they will finally be seen and understood, and the parent will change their emotionally neglectful, self absorbed ways. No!!!That‚Äôs never going to happen. Take that fantasy and draw a big barsinister through it üö´.This fantasy may take the form of endless emotional demonstrations, conversations and confrontations that leave the emotionally immature parents feeing uncomfortable and defensive and leave the adult child feeling wounded and unsupported all over again. This dynamic often gets reenacted in adult relationships with partners, whereby the adult child of emotionally immature parents seeks out partners who are emotionally similar to their problematic parental relationship. You know.That ‚Äòsame relationship different person‚Äô cycle. #NightmareThe author posits that if theses dynamics go unidentified, unprocessed and unresolved, than they can dominate and ruin your love, friendship and work relationships, and (perhaps most disturbingly) may be transmitted to your children trans-generationally.The author has TONS of good advice about what can be done. But perhaps most immediately effective are the following. Boundaries: identify how long you can be in contact with your emotionally immature parent, without loosing your objectivity and without becoming emotionally reactive, and limit your contact with the parent, not to exceed that amount. Limit your conversations to non contentious topics. And (warning) be prepared for the subject to almost always come back to them. Accept and Manage: rather than endlessly emotionally engaging with the parent, the author recommends accepting that you can‚Äôt change someone else‚Äôs emotional reality with yours. In other words, let go of your fantasy that they will finally see understand your perspective and drop the rope on the emotional tug of war that‚Äôs exhausting both of you. Surrender. You‚Äôll win by loosing.Trust me on this one. The author instead recommends remaining observational and outcome driven. Observe the parents current level of capacity. Identify achievable, realistic goals you can accomplish together, and stick to those. This book is LOADED to the gills with wisdom, intelligence and excellent advice (a rarity to be sure). If you‚Äôre curious. Get it. If this book is your jam, you will know within the first chapter. If it is. Than this book might help you finally find your way home to the sanity and serenity you have been seeking. Awesome Read üòç",160,24

Written by a clinical psychologist, this was surprisingly neither too academic nor too 'self-helpy'. A friend on finding out that I am reading this book said to me, ""this is what i have spent the last 2 years in therapy trying to process/unpack, and i am so glad to have found this book.""There is power in this book, and it could be a terrific read - but only if you're the right audience for it.

23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,Lisa,971,3331,4,"June 21, 2018","This is a book you pick out for a very specific reason, and it is hardly possible to review it in a neutral way. So I won't.I hope that I don't have to recommend it to anyone, as it means opening up a Pandora's box of unresolved issues with major impact on who you are and how you deal with life.Let's just say this: if you have the feeling that something was missing in your life, and that you were distinctly different from other people with regards to your family relationships, this book may help you to understand your defence mechanisms, your responses and guilt trap feelings. It may show you a way forward to realise your own potential, and a way to accept the limitations of relationships with emotionally immature people in your environment. It may help you develop a stronger sense of self and new confidence in your right to live your life according to your own wishes and dreams. It may cause pain. And it does contain nuts :-) But no worries - if you are a classic internaliser (externalisers usually don't read self-help books), you will have developed a strong sense of humour as a vital survival skill.  This book is the apple Eve ate to gain knowledge of her all-consuming, emotionally immature parent.",123,17
23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,Angel,30,11,5,"January 16, 2016","I wish I had read this book sooner! Finally validation that my family's repeated claim that I am ""too sensitive"" is more a reflection of their own emotional deficiencies than my own! Even though I knew my parental relations were not entirely healthy, they were still my primary model for relationships and, consequently, I had unwittingly come to see some dysfunctional behaviors as normal. This book made me realize that much of what I thought was just my personality were really defense mechanisms that commonly develop in response to emotionally immature caregivers. The descriptions were so on point that I teared up a bit reading it, but that's a sensitive internalizer for you! This book filled the much-needed role of clearly and compassionately showing what healthy behaviors I should expect in relationships and what healthy behaviors I need to work on adopting. Some of this I had discovered through life experience. I could have recognized and avoided some emotionally abusive situations if I had read this book earlier.",63,2

Not much there, though, on how to overcome the defenses you built in response and change your own thought process/behavior. It's discussed, but it's very high level and not very helpful. ""Do this,"" not ""Here's how you can do this."" This isn't necessarily a book for people who recognize their parents as emotionally immature already and want to know how to overcome that influence in their own lives. If you're already on board with that, this won't be very helpful.",53,2

My copy is so marked-up, it could be a diary.I‚Äôm a little skeptical (perhaps too much) of clinical psychologists. Unfortunately I think it‚Äôs a field that has far too much pseudoscience swept up in its mainstream, and I‚Äôm far more willing to listen to research psychologists. But Gibson (a PsyD clinical psychologist) is a strong exception. She is clear, nuanced, refers to the research, and doesn‚Äôt make sweeping statements or treat the brain as a mystical space hiding trauma in its dark corners. Highly recommend.",49,2

I could, at least, because this book breaks down that there are actually four types of emotionally immature parents and just nails it: Emotional, Driven, Passive, Rejecting.The book does a great job of distinguishing the difference between what it's like growing up with an emotionally mature vs immature parent (because if we haven't grown up with a mature parent it's hard to know what it's *supposed* to be like), the affect that has on the child and their development, the struggles and hard-wired characteristics that now grown up adult deals with, how to shake up and out of it (as best you can), how to deal with your parents in present day, and how to recognize healthy mature people, in general, so you can have healthier connections in your adult life.It basically reads like a definition and how-to guide and I feel like I'd need to walk around with the book as a reference for the next few years.What I took away from the book was validation of the f'ed-upness of my upbringing, clarity about *how* my parents are emotionally immature, the fact that they have absolutely no ability to be introspective and understand their behavior's impact (that's super enlightening), that your emotionally immature parents will NEVER change so it's important to give up the fantasy of having the parent you want from them, strategies for dealing with parents/emotionally immature people in present day and an understanding of ""Oh crap, I have some of these characteristics myself."" ::face palm::There's a wealth of information here delivered in a well-written, broken into clear sections kind of way that allows for easier digestibility and reference.Very good book.

23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,Dennis,350,36,2,"November 1, 2018","This book hit close to home and certainly had a lot that I could identify with, having been raised in a home with two very emotionally immature parents trying to do their best. I give them a lot of credit for what they did right, but the truth is a lot of the immaturity persists to this day. Fortunately, books like this can be of aid in my quest to break the cycle.The problem I had with this book is that the author speaks authoritatively but without much citation to research. Her primary sources are her own clients from her own practice and her own experiences. Sure, life experience counts for a lot, but it was apparent that the author's own bias often came into play. And I felt like the author had a tendency to victimize her clients even though obviously the therapist was typically getting one side of the story during counseling sessions.My wish for myself and for others is that adults take primary responsibility for their own emotional health and well being, and own up to the fact when they fall short. But this assumes a certain level of emotional maturity and therein lies the problem. This book provides a few tools for handling key relationships with people who are simply incapable or unwilling to manage their own emotional health. And for that it is useful.",42,N/A
23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,Alexa White,7,8,3,"October 6, 2019","This book had a lot of good information wrapped up in a lot of biases and harmful statements.The basic framework of the book and the language of emotional maturity vs emotional immaturity is something genuinely freeing, and genuinely really good to be aware of. I'm able to evaluate my relationships in new light and generally feel like I have a whole new toolbox available.The problem is this book is highly biased against those with low empathy (empathy =/= the ability to express compassion), those who are prone to bouts of all-consuming emotional reactivity (like traumatized people), and it has a few negative things to say about how ""problematic"" externalizers are, without acknowledging how an externalizer can still be a good person (in fact, many a time, ""externalizer"" is used in place of ""abuser""). It generally ignores how externalization can still have the ability to place their externalization elsewhere instead of the person or situation that caused it, and instead assumes externalizers always explode on others the minute they become emotional.Many, many, many of my friends are the kinds of people this book treats as abusers (and, using the book's own rubrics, they are not abusers despite their diagnoses making the author treat them like they are). It lacks a necessary neutrality in describing neurotypes that are outside the realm of typical, and instead very obviously places some people as ""better"" for how they process emotions. According to the author, those who can figure things out completely on their own are wonderful angels who will psychologically grow in leaps and bounds, while those who have to talk out their feelings with others are doomed to never making any progress unless they learn to figure things out completely on their own. Also, empathy in the form of feeling the emotions another person is feeling as they describe them to you is the only way to form connection, with everything else being the mark of a sociopath. I find the concept absolutely preposterous, with many a life story reflecting otherwise.The worst part is, a lot of the traits that the author describes as ""internalizer"" traits can indeed be found in externalizers who were invalidated as externalizers, therefore forced to internalize all of their pain instead of expressing it‚Äî and in turn, it fails to acknowledge the wounds of not being allowed to express another person hurt you that hits externalizers doubly hard. Not only were they denied the ability to be hurt (the same as internalizers), but they were forced to perform a role that is not themselves... something that the book acknowledges as a problem. But thanks to the author's own biases, the book doesn't extend an ounce of compassion towards those people, instead assuming all externalizers were validated in their immediate outbursts and were, in turn, nurtured into an abuser role.It's good information. I'm glad I read the book. But I cannot in good faith recommend it unless I give all of the above as a disclaimer, because it *will* be a very hurtful book to read depending on your neurotype, emotional processing style, and empathy levels.",37,5

There's no shortage of self-help books in my house, all of which I've purchased in a feeble attempt to pinpoint that *thing* that's not quite right.I've suffered from anxiety and depression most of my life. I've also found it very difficult to connect with anyone on more than a superficial level, and most interactions left me drained. I couldn't be myself when I interacted with anyone. I was always preoccupied with being judged than establishing a friendship based on intimate communication. That requires a level of vulnerability that, until now, has remained elusive. I was truly surprised at how well the author was able to capture the many nuances of relationships with emotionally immature parents, and the myriad impacts that they have on their children. I know that change is going to be a process, but this book has made me feel adequately equipped to at least start the journey toward healing. And finally, FINALLY, I realize that it wasn't me after all. I'm not fundamentally flawed and unloveable. I thank the author from the bottom of my heart for her dedication to writing this book.

I especially liked that she detailed both the different kinds of emotionally immature types you could encounter in parents and the the content of the two broad responses to experiencing this parenting (internalizing and externalizing). The first part really helped me because I was definitely one someone who internalized and so I had the ‚Äúbut maybe my parent wasn‚Äôt immature enough for me to complain about‚Äù thought and resisted reading this at first. It made me feel bad- until I read the categories. Hearing about the different ways internalizing and externalizing can manifest also helped me make sense of some of their behaviors- as we know, parents inherit a lot of how they raise their kids from their own parents and pass on a lot of their own unresolved traumas. If you‚Äôre pretty sure your emotionally immature parent(s) also had emotionally immature parents you‚Äôll find a ton that makes sense here. I also saw a lot of behaviors that I, unfortunately, also act out. That emotional immaturity was passed down to me in a whole new way as I struggled to find coping mechanisms to deal with it. The book is great about giving you strategies to deal with your emotionally immature parent that I totally intend to use, but I wish it also have resources for those of us who have realized we also have some of those marks of emotional immaturity because of what was modeled for us or how we coped with it. How do we ensure we don‚Äôt pass it down again? How do we change? I wish she had added that. I also feel like she set REALLY high expectations for what emotionally mature people are like in that last chapter. I guess she was just covering all her bases but it did kind of make it seem like no one could possibly be 1000% emotionally mature. But I guess it‚Äôs one of those if you‚Äôre batting 8 out of 10 you‚Äôre still ok type things? I hope? I feel like that‚Äôs something I could do- even if my parent never will. But other than that I found this book had a clear, kind, firm voice that used advice, research and anecdotes you could recognize yourself in to explain its points. It does not allow you delusions, which I super needed (see the part about ‚Äúhealing fantasies‚Äù) but also doesn‚Äôt berate you with them or make you feel stupid for not seeing it before. Some things will never change. The focus is how to deal with it in a sustainable way that doesn‚Äôt damage you further.",30,7
23129659,Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents How to Heal from Distant Rejecting or SelfInvolved Parents,kaelan,258,305,2,"April 11, 2022","Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents, by the clinical psychologist Lindsay C. Gibson, contains some helpful advice. But I must say, the fundamental argument is rather sus.Gibson begins by identifying a constellation of nebulous but fairly relatable symptoms, such as:(1) feeling a vague sense of emptiness or of being alone in the world;(2) putting other peoples' needs first; and(3) ending up in unfulfilling relationships. Gibson next describes what she means by an ""emotionally immature parent"" ‚Äì again, using nebulous but relatable terms. For instance, she says that your parent could be emotionally immature if they have exhibited any of the following:(1) My parent often overreacted to relatively minor things.(2) My parent was often irritated by individual differences or different points of view.(3) Facts and logic were no match for my parents opinions.The book omits to flag, of course, the subjective dimension to some of these descriptors.Finally, after the reader has identified with the personal symptoms (""that's me!"") and the parental descriptors (""that's mom/dad!""), Gibson goes ahead and concludes ‚Äì with almost zero argument ‚Äì that the two are causally related. Which, somewhat ironically, plays into one of the book's definitions of emotional immaturity: that one's beliefs are based not in objectivity but in what feels true.As a clinical psychologist, Gibson certainly boasts a great deal of first-hand, empirical experience. But this doesn't change the fact that she's theorizing on the basis of only one side of the equation. Indeed, as she herself admits, therapy attracts certain kinds of people ‚Äì namely, ""internalizers"", who believe that change comes from within rather than from without ‚Äì which means that she's working from a very limited data set to begin with.In short, a methodologically shaky book, so please read with a grain of salt, but one with some useful morsels scattered throughout.",30,N/A
