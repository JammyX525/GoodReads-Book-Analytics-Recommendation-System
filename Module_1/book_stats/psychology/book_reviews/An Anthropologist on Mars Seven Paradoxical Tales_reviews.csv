64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Always Pouting,568,677,4,"August 14, 2018",I've read about neurologist Oliver Sacks in other books but I'm pretty sure this was my first experience reading one of his books and I actually really enjoyed it. Sacks writes up narratives for patients he works with or people he meets with neurological conditions in a way that makes it much easier to step into the perspective of the person and gives them a story. I personally don't enjoy reading case studies in academia because they do tend to stay detached from the person being talked about and so I really liked Sacks more personal accounts of other people. I especially liked reading about Tourette's syndrome and the surgeon who has Tourette's syndrome because I didn't have as much familiarity with it. The other account I enjoyed was the one of the artist who becomes colorblind later in life and found the neurophysiology discussion of the situation really cool because I already had some knowledge of the visual pathways. At times he can seem to go on and on when writing and it can be tedious but I think the over all material was really interesting and I look forward to reading more of his work.,135,5
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,cathy,25,18,5,"May 16, 2007","In An Anthropologist on Mars, Oliver Sacks seamlessly weaves fascinating patient stories and lessons in neurology for the layperson. This may sound quite dry if you're not into reading about bizarre behavior from brain circuitry goes awry, but Sacks makes the science very palatable. He acts as our well-traveled tour guide as we explore the everyday lives and thinking processes of seven people who have made creative use of their cognitive hiccups.Some of the patients featured in this collection of case studies have managed neurological differences from birth; others have had to re-program and mourn grave deficits due to freak events. Dr. Sacks explains the malleability and compensatory functions built into the brain when one portion becomes dim. Perhaps more importantly, he demonstrates via his subjects how the human spirit also adapts after sensory loss. His tale of a painter who was made colorblind after a car accident is an example of the latter: Sacks works through myriad possible explanations for this man’s newly colorless world; however, he is eventually left without a reason—or a cure. During this process, the artist manages to reform his creative identity; he comes to see his newly gray vision as ""pure"" and not “distracted by color”, so previously unseen forms begin to shape his noirish, multi-shadowed work. I read this book about 4 years ago and the story that has stayed with me is that of a surgeon with uncontrollable Tourette's. This man is unable to stop his violent tics and outbursts even for a few moments, but he is allowed a mysteriously zen-like reprieve when his hands (and quite possibly his mind) are steadied as he performs surgery. The story illustrates for me what I think is Sacks' message: People are not their pathologies, and talents and interests should always be encouraged, even in the face of what we sometimes misdiagnose as deficits. Neurology for Sacks is a vocation, not a career. He conducts his research and writing in a truly humanistic spirit, and what I most love about both is the compassion and respect he shows his patients; they are not treated as curious oddities or guinea pigs, as is the case in so many medical and psychological case studies. Throughout all his work Sacks maintains a sense of wonder about the people he treats. He demonstrates that people who seem detached from experience can have full lives, and in some cases, an inner life that is cognitively richer than that of ""normal"" folks ( i.e. those of us unhindered by neurological or physical challenges). The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat is considered essential Sacks, but for reasons stated--especially that surgeon--I much prefer this collection. ",34,3
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Ian,691,65,5,"September 20, 2021","At the beginning of this book, the late Oliver Sacks explains that he wrote part of it whilst his right arm was in plaster. He describes how the activity of writing with his left hand would have caused neurons in his brain to forge new pathways and make new connections to support this new task. He cites this example as a means of introducing the main theme of this book, which features seven individuals characterised by what most of us would view as a severe disability. In each case though, the brain had adapted to “create a new organisation and order…one that fits its altered disposition and needs.” Several of the individuals who feature in this book possess(ed) hidden talents that may not have existed without their “disability”, whilst others managed extraordinary adaptations to altered circumstances. Through their stories Dr Sacks challenges the concept of disability, and asks whether the individuals featured should be considered less as disabled and more as people with an unusual mode of being.Several of the stories feature artists, perhaps most notably the autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire, known for his drawings of cityscapes and buildings. Another is about Franco Magnani, a “memory artist” known for his extraordinarily accurate paintings of his home village of Pontito in Tuscany, most of which were produced at a time when he had not visited Pontito for decades. I did wonder whether the paintings by Wiltshire and Magnani might be lifeless, but I looked up their work on the web and found them anything but. A third chapter features an unnamed artist who suddenly developed total colour blindness following a car accident that may have been combined with a stroke. This wasn’t the type of colour blindness that involves difficulty in distinguishing red and green, but an absolute inability to see any colours at all. The artist adapted to his new world and eventually made a virtue of the unique perspective he had.Another chapter featured Shirl Jennings, who became almost completely blind in infancy but who had his sight restored in late adulthood. He worked as a masseur and was at home in the world of touch, but after regaining his sight found the visual world very difficult to cope with. There’s another chapter about a surgeon with Tourette’s Syndrome. Dr Sacks is quite open in being initially surprised such a career was possible for someone with Tourette’s. Perhaps the saddest story was “The Last Hippie”, which featured a man with a brain tumour that resulted in him being unable to remember anything beyond the late 1960s. Despite Dr Sacks’ attempts to accentuate the positive, this story seemed a rather tragic case. It reminded me of “The Lost Mariner” which featured in The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat.The final story in the book features the autistic savant Dr Temple Grandin. In the book she is presented as someone conscious of her difficulties with understanding language and human emotion, but also as someone who would not trade her savant abilities in order to become more like a “normal” person. Dr Sacks notes that only a small minority of autistic people possess savant-style abilities, although Dr Grandin is described as believing that most autistic people have them, even if undiscovered.The stories are fascinating in themselves, and Dr Sacks describes each individual with his usual respect. For me though, the best thing about this book was the insight it provided into the lives of those who may be considered “disabled” by society, but whose talents are, in many respects, more developed than the rest of us.",29,5
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Paul Bryant,"2,161",9021,3,"April 21, 2013","Confession time ! I must admit - friends, judge not lest ye be judged - that I boohooed my way through the last part of Awakenings The Movie, with all those frozen people coming back to life and catching tennis balls and (spoiler alerts) then living life to the FULL for one brief shining moment, and doing the hoochy coochy, which is the only dance they could remember from the 1920s which is when they all froze up, and then Mr De Niro doing the herky jerk dance which was one of his own invention, and then reverting back to catatonia (the condition not the band) and to cap it all Robin Williams not asking out that hot nurse. I mean, boo hoo hoo! You had to have a heart made of the purest cabbage not to.Anyway, Oliver Sachs makes me queasy with a capital Q. He's peddling a modern freak show, in the politest possible way. As you probably know this book contains seven tales of psychological weirdness and it's all very further reaches of the human brain and yet the indomitable human spirit conquering all and isn't life wonderful. Feel-good autism with haemorrhages. I get the feeling someone calls up Dr Sachs and says ""I found a good one for you, over in Montana, twin 70 year old sisters who all talk backwards and live in a house they made out of Herman's Hermits albums"" and Dr Sachs is out of the door already, flagging down the nearest taxi, his laptop aquivering.It may be I'm being a trifle unfair here.",19,15
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,David Rubenstein,801,2503,5,"June 27, 2013","This is a fascinating book about seven people with very special, mental conditions. Oliver Sacks is a neurologist, and he spent a lot of time with each of these people in their homes and in their environments. As a result, Sacks can go into great detail about each of the seven, and explains their histories, their mental conditions, and how they cope with their situations. He tells their stories with wonderful insight, and with empathy. The most interesting aspect is how Sacks, like a detective, tries to figure out what is going on in their brains.Each of the seven people is special, and different. One of them is an artist who had an accident, and as a result became completely color-blind! He had to learn how to cope with his new handicap, and continue being a very creative artist. This case is singular for two reasons; first, almost all people who are color-blind are born that way, and second, very few people are completely color-blind like this artist.Another chapter is about a blind man who undergoes eye operations and can suddenly see, for the first time since early childhood. Even though he regains his sight, he has trouble integrating what he sees into a coherent world-view. Absolutely fascinating!Yet another chapter is about a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome. He has numerous and bizarre tics and habits, which his family and his community has grown to accept. He also flies a plane! But when he is in surgery, or when he flies, his strange behavior is temporarily suspended and acts quite normally.Two of the chapters are about autistic people: Steve is a youth who has an amazing artistic talent. He is capable of taking in a scene in a few seconds, and later drawing it in detail. He also has a remarkable musical talent. The last chapter is the amazing story about Temple Grandin, a professor of animal science at Colorado State University and well-known author of books about autism and animal behavior. While Temple Grandin freely admits not being able to understand human behavior, emotions, and social cues and communications, she is able to articulate her mode of thinking and her outlook on life to a remarkable degree.I've read a number of books by Oliver Sacks--this one is my favorite!",18,3
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Nandakishore Mridula,"1,238",2205,5,"September 8, 2017","This was my first introduction to Sacks, and the fascinating world of neural disorders. The colour-blind artist, the man who kept on painting the same place from memory, the man without long term memory, the autistic professor - I found all the tales absolutely rivetting.",15,N/A
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,David,865,1268,2,"December 17, 2007","For some reason, the essays of Oliver Sacks don't rock my world. He's got the attention-grabbing title thing down pat, and each case study does have a kernel of interest. But generally, I'd be just as happy if each essay were cut by 50% - most chapters didn't really sustain my interest to the end.Full disclosure: my faint generalized lack of enthusiasm for Dr S may stem from nothing more than guilt by association with Robin Williams. I have never denied being shallow.If you're in the mood for fun medical case studies (yes, I mean *you*, ""House"" fans), I'd recommend Berton Roueche's ""The Medical Detectives"", culled from his ""Annals of Medicine"" pieces in The New Yorker, over this collection.",11,1 comment
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Yousif Al Zeera,231,80,5,"February 17, 2018","Matching the ""7 Wonders of the Ancient World"", this book delves into the ""7 Wonders of the Human World"". It expands the human capacity to better understand the strengths and capabilities of what we might consider a pathology.These real stories really move you and instill some much-needed optimism to whatever seemingly negative traits or deficiencies you might possess or carry that are considered abnormal compared to the traits enjoyed by the mass. Whether yourself, a family member or a friend is colorblind or autistic, suffer from a cerebral blindness or Tourette's or became one fine day amnesiac and wouldn't be able to recollect anything happening to you till the rest of your life; this book shows how humans are fine-tuned to ""adapt"" to such circumstances above our expectations.",10,N/A
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Mehrsa,"2,234",3664,5,"December 15, 2017","Such a fascinating and illuminating book. I've followed Sacks' work for a while so none of these stories were new, but the book is so well written and the analysis is brilliant. I loved the first and last stories the best--the story of color and the last of autism. Sachs probes into the meaning of life, the nature of humanity, friendship, love, art, and intelligence by looking at neurological dysfunction. Such wonderful insights.",9,N/A

64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Caitlin Constantine,128,127,5,"March 23, 2010","The theme of this book can be summed up in one single idea, about the plasticity of the human brain, and the way the deficit of disability can be turned into the benefit of compensation. Isn't that such a cool thought? What seems like a disability may ultimately end up a gift.That's what this whole book is about. Sacks is a neurologist with a bit of Sherlock Holmes mixed in, and he finds himself drawn to some of the most inexplicable cases, like a painter who goes completely colorblind after a concussion, a young boy with autism who also happens to be an extremely gifted visual artist. (I was very compelled by the story of the man, blind since childhood, who gets his sight back and finds himself profoundly disturbed by the experience, although I also loved reading about his time with Temple Grandin.) He is a writer of enormous sensitivity, and you never get the sense that he has dehumanized his subjects. Rather, what makes his writing so remarkable is his tremendous respect for everyone he writes about, even if they sometimes annoy him (as with one man, who obsessively paints his memories of the ruined Sicilian village in which he was born.)But Sacks isn't content to just stay on the surface, to just write out case histories of these people. He delves into theory and literature on subjects that, well, I can't speak for anyone else, but subjects that I take for granted, things like color, emotion, memory and perspective. Things that enrich our lives tremendously, but are also such an integral part of our existences that it can be impossible to imagine life without them. I suppose it makes sense that a book about brains would be so thought-provoking, not just because, hey, it's about brains, but because our brains are the centers of our existence, the way we perceive everything that is going on within and without. I came away from this book with a new appreciation, not just for my own mind, but also for the myriad ways in which people grow and develop, and for all of the strange and beautiful gifts such differences bestow upon us.Recommended for anyone with an interest in....well, actually, recommended for anyone.

64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Siobhan,"4,403",461,3,"October 26, 2016","An Anthropologist on Mars is one of those books that has been mentioned countless times across my academic career, with lectures and students alike constantly referencing it. It took me a long time to work around to it, but I can finally say I’ve given it a read.For me, An Anthropologist on Mars was an interesting read. Considering how much people had enjoyed it, though, I had expected a little bit more. It covered seven interesting cases, allowing me to better understand the specific cases mentioned rather than simply having the knowledge of someone who had glossed over the cases during studying. I’d expected to be more engaged, I’d expected to be pulled right into the cases, yet I found it wasn’t as engaging as other academic reads have been.Don’t get me wrong, it was enjoyable; it simply felt harder to get through than it should have.

64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Jarrah,791,42,3,"May 23, 2016","An Anthropologist on Mars is an engaging collection of seven neurological case studies that illustrate a supposed paradox - that what is perceived as disability or neurological deficit can result in amazing adaptations that make it a kind of gift. For example, a painter sustains a brain injury that makes him unable to see colour, and after a period of initial depression and disorientation, begins to appreciate his new way of seeing, and to reproduce it in black and white art. The most famous case outlined in this book is of Temple Grandin, the renowned animal scientist and autism spokesperson. But the case I found most compelling was that of Virgil, a man in his fifties blind since childhood, who regains vision through surgery and finds his entire identity and way of life destabilized. Sacks weaves together his subjects' case histories and stories of his visits with excerpts from medical, scientific, historical, psychoanalytic and classic literature. At times it gets a little bogged down in the history of research of a particular condition, but overall it remains accessible. I don't doubt Sacks' good intentions towards his subjects - his goal was clearly to get a ""normal"" audience to understand his subjects' experiences and think about them as more than their disability or condition. In a few cases it's clear Sacks provided some useful treatment and advice to the people he writes about - such as the colourblind artist he studies or Greg, ""the last hippie"" - a man whose brain tumour dramatically affected his memory, personality and sense of time. However, there were moments that gave me pause from an ethical perspective. Ultimately he is profiting off stories of people who, in some cases, can't fully consent to this or appreciate his words (Greg being the best example). This becomes especially problematic when he uses his expert status to override their voices. For example he describes some subjects somewhat condescendingly (e.g. his references to Virgil's weight and ill health) and questions the wisdom of friends and families who actually observe the subjects on a more regular basis (e.g. questioning Margaret's faith that Stephen Wiltshire experiences emotions). While these may all be fair medical observations, I would have been interested to know more about conversations Sacks would have had with the subjects and their advocates before publishing their stories.",5,N/A
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Cindy,"1,167",30,5,"June 1, 2012","Fascinating reading of seven case histories of people with neurological disorders including Temple Grandin who is autistic and the author of Emergence, Labeled Autistic which I read several years ago and loved. The case of the colorblind painter and to see and not to see were very interesting to me. People who had long term blindness, upon having sight restored have no visual memories to support a perception of what they are seeing. They cannot understand size or distance. Someone living their whole life in a dense rainforest who is brought out to a wide empty plain, may reach out to touch the mountaintops with their hands; no concept of how far away they are.A man cannot recognize his dog as being the same animal when it turns in different angles. He can sometimes see an eye, the ear, or nose, but cannot see them together as a whole.Also: the blind live in time, not space. Space is reduced to one's own body when blind. The position of the body is known not by what objects have been passed, but by how long it has been in motion. For the blind, people are not there unless they speak. People are in motion, they are temporal, they come and they go. They come out of nothing; they disappear.",5,1 comment
64666,An Anthropologist on Mars Seven Paradoxical Tales,Charlene,875,484,5,"January 27, 2016","Oliver sacks provides entertaining and informative stories of people living with various brain abnormalities. In this book, sacks focused on abnormalities that often compelled the individual to record their environment in extreme ways. For example, Sacks suggest maybe we are all hardwired for recording history, since our only tools for millions of years were our brains and voices, and we handed down an oral history of human existence, throughout the generations. However, in some individuals, the areas responsible for this are overly active, and often the other parts of the brain are under-active. This results in echolalia, a perfect recording of the environment that can be reproduced over and over, a perfect memory that can produce drawings of whole cities-- even years after the artist saw it, a replication of various sounds-- such as instruments, an obsession on preserving the past-- as with someone stuck in the past and unable to live in the present day. Sacks also gives a wonderful account of his interviews and examinations of Temple Grandin. Instead of seeing her brain as defective, Sacks truly wants to understand how she might simply think differently. Even when Grandin herself views her brain as defective, it is clear Sacks is more interested in understanding the way her brain works than he is in judging if it's defective or not. Sacks is an excellent writer. The pages flew by and in no time, the book was sadly over. I love him so much; time to start a new Sacks book. ",4,N/A
