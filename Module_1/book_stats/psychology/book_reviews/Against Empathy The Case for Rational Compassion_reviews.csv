29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Trevor,"1,279",21300,2,"January 22, 2020","I’ve been on an odd sort of journey with this book. First of all, I came to it as a bit of a convert. You see, I’ve been doing research at work into intercultural understanding and multiculturalism, and a lot of the theory around that starts from the premise that for students to become interculturally understanding they first need to learn empathy. This hardly seems controversial – I mean, we have all read To Kill a Mockingbird, and so walking a mile in my shoes seems to be pretty good advice. But then, in the middle of last year, I mentioned to the woman who sits beside me at work that I was starting to think empathy might not be the unbridled good that I’d always taken it to be. I was almost expecting to be told to not be so bloody-minded and contrary, but instead she suggested I read Megan Boler’s ‘The Risks of Empathy: Interrogating multiculturalism’s gaze’. There’s only one thing worse than being a smartarse academic who challenges the otherwise unchallengeable – and that is being late to the game. Damn! If there is any consolation to be found, it is in the fact that this book was published in 2016, and Boler’s article was printed in 1997 – so, I’m not the only one late here.There were things that annoyed me about this book. I was really surprised that it spent quite so much time referencing pop-psy books and writers. I mean, people like Pinker, Malcolm Gladwell and Sam Harris. The author is a professor of psychology at Yale. I know this book is written for a popular audience, but that still seems deeply strange behaviour to me. You might not think so, but one of the first things they teach you when you are becoming an academic is to go for the source of ideas, rather than the popularisers. I have problems with both Harris and Pinker – so, amusingly enough, I experienced precisely the heightened sense of cynicism he was discussing throughout this book right from the off. I’m happy to admit that the problem is my own bias – but even given my bias, it still strikes me as strange that someone in his position wouldn't be using academic references and standards more, even while writing for a popular audience.Okay, so what is the problem with apple pie and motherhood? Or rather empathy? Well, as he says here, one of the problems is that empathy provides something of a spotlight. You can’t show empathy to more than one person at a time. If empathy means walking a mile in someone else’s shoes, well, that’s a mile in only one person’s shoes you can walk at any given time. And since there are over 7 billion people in the world, well, that’s a lot of walking you are going to have to do. By the way, 7 billion miles is another 50% further again out into space as the journey from here to Pluto. And as Boler makes clear, the problem with empathy is that there are people’s shoes that are simply not going to fit you - I'm never going to really know what it feels like to be intersexual or transexual - and my best intentioned guesses are likely to be well off the mark. And there will be shoes you simply will never be able to bring yourself to put your foot inside. But does that then mean those people do not deserve your empathy or the potential benefits that come from your empathy? Does it mean they ought to be treated badly? Am I only required to feel sympathy for people I can ultimately ‘understand’ and put myself in their place? A case in point. My daughter spent a year in Japan and while she was there she went out with a Japanese boy for a while. One night he decided to give her a real treat. They went to an up market restaurant and he ordered Fugo for them – fugo is otherwise known as the fish that kills. Well, sort of – because actually most fugo is now farmed, rather than caught in the ocean, and so it never gets to eat the algae it would use to produce the poison that can kill you. You know, it is the same old story, when myth and fact conflict, print the myth. That wasn’t the part of the story that bothered my daughter, though – you know, the part about her new boyfriend trying to poison her. The problem was that the fish arrived at the table very much alive (at least to my daughter's eyes) – it had been filleted alive only moments before arriving at the table, and so the fillets were still moving on the plate - 'moving'? 'Quivering'? Anyway, she told her boyfriend that there was simply no way she could bring herself to put an ‘alive’ piece of fish into her mouth. Her boyfriend looked at her dumbfounded - not least because this was probably costing him an arm and a leg, and kept saying to her – ‘but it’s so fresh – it’s so delicious’. This cultural difference was so great and so fascinating to her that she ended up writing her Honours thesis around it.This is basically my criticism of this book. While there is lots of discussion about empathy, and the problems of empathy – and most of these I agree with (you know, nationalism neatly divides the world into those you can and can’t feel empathy for) I think one of the mechanisms that helps ensure empathy cannot develop that is underestimated in this book is disgust. You know, as Pinker himself says in one of his books, the reason for food taboos in cultures is to ensure that you don’t end up marrying someone from outside your ‘group’ – and these food taboos are always taboos to do with meat. No religion bars the eating of carrots – but eating pork…or eating alive fish... And if you can’t share food with someone, it is very hard to develop any other form of relationship with them. This is part of the reason why Christianity, which from the very beginning sought to be a universal religion, rejected the food taboos of the commandments in the Old Testament. A companion is literally someone you eat with (from the Latin for ‘with bread’) – stopping people from eating together puts a significant obstacle in the way of them becoming friends.But the other thing that annoyed me about this is something else I’ve been reading about lately – that the most effective way to overcome cultural differences (to develop empathy, to get people to understand each other despite their cultural differences) is to do what you can to get them to actively work together toward a common goal. A really good book on this is O’Connor’s The Nature of Prejudice. Which then brings me to my final concern with this book – it’s the ‘we just need to be more rational’ bias it displays. I’ve got nothing against reason, per se, but he ends this book by saying that reason is objective (basically the same for everyone no matter their background) and so it is our main hope. And, to be honest, as much as I would quite like that to be the case, it isn’t hard to see the number of times ‘reason’ has been used to demonise entire populations. You know, one of this guy’s heroes, as I've already mentioned, is Sam Harris – and Sam's ‘all of Islam is evil’ approach to world politics seems to me to be lacking both empathy and compassion (and 'reason' if it comes to that). It makes me a bit ill to think of how he has used his 'reason' to effectively justify god knows how many millions of deaths since 9/11. Like I said at the beginning of this review – I don’t think empathy is enough, I might even agree that empathy is worse at achieving positive relations between cultures than it is generally made out to, but I also think that we know the answer to how to address this. We need to actively find ways to achieve transformation based on different cultures working together towards common ends as equals. This has been proven time and again to be the most effective way to end conflict and to encourage people to recognise their common humanity. If ‘reason’ leads us to Sam Harris and his 'Islam is evil' rubbish – we have no hope at all.",166,28
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Darwin8u,"1,559",8646,3,"July 28, 2017","""Empathy is what makes us human; it's what makes us both subjects and objects of moral concern. Empathy betrays us only when we take it as a moral guide.""- Paul Bloom, Against EmpathyI'm a sucker for pop psychology or moral philosophy or moral politics books. Kinda my jam. I'm also a fan of books that flip certain general assumptions about what is an absolute good. I remember first reading a book called In Defense of Elitism years ago after my freshman year in college. It was a catchy title, and fairly interesting little treatise, and it made me think. Bloom's 'Against Empathy' fits into the same category as William A. Henry III defense of Elitist behavior. Neither is saying it is good to be bad. They are just saying we need to still examine our character heroes and assumptions about what really is a good.Basically, Paul Bloom (a professor of psychology at Yale) is arguing that using empathy to make decisions about policy, etc., is perhaps a bad idea. He is specifically talking about the Bill Clinton ""I feel your pain"" kinda empathy, not the I can identify that you are in pain, cognitive psychology. Because of certain biases built into our brain, using empathy as a guide instead of rationality, rules, and reason typically leads to us making inferior social and political choices. We are replacing something that might be better done with our brain with an inferior tool, guided by our heart and our emotions. That is it. He has narrowed the definition of empathy down to ""feeling what others feel"" and makes sure to NOT conflate empathy with morality or compassion. His arguments are mainly valid, from my perspective. His title is clever. His prose and stories are so, so. I think the book is worth the time, but it wasn't great writing and a bit padded and repetitive. Otherwise, yeah, I feel it.",121,10
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Joachim Stoop,706,470,3,"February 5, 2017","This was not a very clear, graspable, usable book.There are lots of valid points here and he uses a flood of empirical data.But while he says he hates endless discussions about connotations, I found the explanation and meaning of the title all about linguistic nuance. I actually find the title a bit of a sales pitch.'Against empathy'. Yes, but fom page one he defends himself against possible misunderstandings. He based this entire book on possible critique against his title, instead of just making his case.Here are some of his most remarkable quotes:""As this book comes to an end, I worry that I have given the impression that I’m against empathy. Well, I am—but only in the moral domain. And even here I don’t deny that empathy can sometimes have good results.""This is 6 pages from the end:""I’ve been playing defense up to now. I’ve been arguing that evidence and theory from neuroscience, social psychology, and cognitive psychology don’t prove our everyday irrationality. But I haven’t yet made a positive case for our everyday rationality, for the role of reasoning and intelligence in our lives. I’ll do this now.""""This distinction between empathy and compassion is critical for the argument I’ve been making throughout this book. And it is supported by neuroscience research."" ""The concern about empathy is not that its consequences are always bad, then. It’s that its negatives outweigh its positives—and that there are better alternatives.""",67,3
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Moshe Hoffman,5,19,5,"April 9, 2022","""Against Empathy"" does a nice job summarizing all the limitations of empathy, and our altruistic drives more generally, such as being nicer to our kin and neighbors, and being especially prone to newsworthy suffering and insensitive to numbers, scale, and efficacy. Paul rightly points out that our logical arguments and conscious deliberation often lead us toward more utilitarian considerations that are a better way to do good. In the process he reviews a ton of interesting experiments and anecdotes in a thoroughly readable book.",41,5
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Holly,"1,001",217,4,"April 18, 2017","Bloom is not really against empathy as in kindness, compassion, other-regard. He's against a kind of empathy that is short-sighted, selfish (as in simple self-regard), that stops us from thinking and using our moral conscience. When he discusses compassion it's in the context of ""cognitive empathy"" and not ""affective empathy."" He quotes Adam Smith a lot. I wished for more emphasis on how empathy depends on a certain selfish or self-regarding feeling. I had this sense a lot while reading Leslie Jamison's Empathy Exams: that why do we have to rely on this emotion that ""I feel it inside myself - as if it's happening to me - and so that's why I have compassion for this person""? Doesn't this ""only if I pretend it's happening to me"" mindset seem a little meager? Maybe I can still feel compassion without understanding exactly what you are experiencing? Would I be more helpful if I put MY emotions aside and looked at the situation?Bloom is worried that empathy will limit us - make us identify only with certain people and not others. He finds empathy suspect. This is a challenge to argue, since it seems as if we're always talking about empathy in the culture these days. (And I know from personal experience that so much becomes clear when it finally occurs to one that the reason a close family-member is utterly thoughtless is that he is deficient in the ability to ""put himself in another's shoes."" - Empathy is invaluable as a starting point to human relations.)Bloom does go off on tangents that don't always seem exactly pertinent to his argument but he is responding to critics - it isn't a traditional scholarly book and more conversational. But not necessarily easy reading either.Is Paul Bloom a social conservative? I don't pick up on that myself and I think I would, but I may have read some critiques of his Just Babies that suggest that. I don't think he is a jerk anyway.I agree with him for the most part - but it feels as if the book is unfinished and he spends much time responding to his critics rather than advancing his actual position. I suppose it is a work in progress, which I understand. His subtitle - the case for rational compassion - isn't borne out. He talks very little about compassion itself, and what this rational compassion looks like in the world. He's very interested in rationality, which is of course suspect these days (neuroscience in the courtroom; claims to refute the existence of free will through brain imaging results).Fascinating reading. I expect to hear more about this subject - the value of empathy and whether we shouldn't put so much stake in it; alternatives to empathy that are as important and more so - from Bloom and other thinkers.",27,7
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Khush,126,95,1,"March 23, 2018","I heard a lot about this book. In fact, a friend of mine suggested that I should read this book. The title itself is quite titillating.As I began to read this book, I found it quite irritating. Half through the book, the writer is still busy explaining what he means by empathy. It is not an easy case to make for 'against empathy,' he tried but I did not find him convincing. Very often, in the book, I felt that he was supporting, and very mildly suggesting, something dangerous that human beings should be more cold and rational to make better decisions and in order to be more effective.In order to support his thesis, he gives well-known examples from real life and tells us how individuals, masses, and even nation states sometimes make bad decisions guided by empathy, but I found that quite sweeping. For instance, I do not think that nation-states act out of empathy, their decisions are more often cold-blooded and rational in nature. First, they make a mess by exerting power over by intervening in other countries' internal affairs, by waging wars for resources and so forth. However, only when a situation goes out of hand, they have to act in the reverse direction, that is to soften or contain the mess. The particular incidents that he mentions from the contemporary American life and his claims that how people in the grip of empathy make false and dangerous decisions. This notion seems to be wrought with some sort inscrutable (bad) agenda.To help one person (spectacularly) while remaining oblivious to many others in a similar situation is a misplaced feature of empathy. Of course, this is so in certain contexts, but it is not something that happens very often. I also do not think that helping one community, people, a region that way (irrationally) is a bad practice and that all the larger issues of injustice and inequality in the world occur due to excessive (ab)use of empathy. In fact, I believe that we should be a bit less reason-oriented, reason has failed us many times. During world wars, nations were not dropping bombs on one another out of empathy, they were using extreme forms for reasons to destroy one another. As one reads this book, in some milder ways, he is suggesting his fellow Americans something else; that acting out of empathy and sending money to war-torn and conflicted zones and to far-flung areas is not required. It is false, misplaced and irrational, and therefore it should be discontinued. And then adds, we need to control our emotions and do it in a 'rational' way for better results. (One way of doing so, is not to be moved by emotions, I found this notion banal.)When one looks at the world, we see that we are already very reason-oriented. In a world that insists on 'wall buildings,' we need more empathy. Of course, those on the right side of the wall and those who seek to strengthen such borders already show that they have learned their lesson well. They are 'against empathy' anyways.On a very basic level, we know that if one is too empathetic, one might not be effective or able to function normally, and in this sense, empathy is useless and negative. But we know this. We do not need science, the so-called modern findings in different fields to tell us something as basic as that. Having said this, without empathy, how would we be? We would be 'less.' If empathy falters, and we have come to a point where we should discard it as something regressive or destructive. I wonder if, then, the sequel of this book could be 'against love.'",21,N/A
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Ceil,387,14,2,"December 17, 2016","Really wanted to like this book, having long suspected that ""I feel your pain"" is part of an anti-logic, anti-rational trend that glorifies individual feelings above all. Aside from setting up some useful distinctions (empathy v compassion, etc.), the author muses at length on examples of linguistic legerdemain around the concept. Nothing particularly useful here.

29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Blair,"1,726",4074,3,"July 13, 2018","Hmm, I thought I would enjoy this more than I did – or at least that I would be more stimulated by it than I was. It takes balls to title your book Against Empathy, but that's somewhat undermined by the fact that the author spends so much time reiterating a) what he means by empathy and b) that he is in fact very much pro-kindness and compassion. Bloom's definition of 'empathy' is the practice of feeling for a person/group by trying to feel their pain, i.e. putting yourself 'in someone else's shoes'. This is absolutely fine, but it's repeated so often that it sometimes feels like it's being mentioned every three or four pages, especially in the first half of the book. It could have been defined in the introduction and left at that.Against Empathy is, imo, not so much an argument against empathy as it is a meticulous separation of the specific concept of empathy from the other values it is often conflated with, such as kindness, compassion, generosity, etc. Bloom believes that empathy can be a poor moral guide. This is most apparent in cases where too much empathy might hinder a person's judgement. For example, an extremely empathic doctor might not be best placed to help a patient; an extremely empathic parent would likely be overprotective to a suffocating degree; charitable acts that centre empathy often do more to assuage the giver's guilt than to help the greatest number of people in the most efficient way. Instead, a combination of rational decision-making and diffused compassion should replace empathy in our process of moral reasoning.There's a decent and persuasive argument at the heart of Against Empathy, but as a book it is repetitive and feels very padded out. Having read it, I feel like I have a much clearer idea of what Bloom thinks is good and useful about being rational, kind and compassionate than what he finds bad and harmful about empathy. I originally put the word 'ironically' at the beginning of that sentence, but I wonder if that was the point after all.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",16,N/A
29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Charlene,875,484,5,"February 21, 2017","Absolutely BRILLIANT! This is a must read for anyone interested in things like:decision-makingempathyingroup/outgroup dynamicspolicy makingsocial constructsinequalitylogic v. emotional regulation on a grand scale Why out of 293 Goodreads reviews does this book only have a 3.75? I can't say for sure, especially since I have not taken the time to read all the negative reviews, but I suspect they come from people who pride themselves on being ""a good person"", because they identify as an empathetic person. They see that as a positive thing, no matter what the result of their emotional decisions. But, just as we came to understand that oxytocin is not just the ""love and trust drug"" and that it is also a key regulator of ingroup/ outgroup thinking (which results in poor treatment for the outgroup), humans are now beginning to understand the downside, and in fact often immoral side, of empathy. Empathy too often results in local empathy that is the equivalent of being on teams, which results in team-like dynamics. The reality is that often when you empathize with one person or one side of an argument, you close yourself off to the other side or the other person. I am not talking about giving 2 sides of an argument equal billing. For example, if one person is being racist, sexist, or otherwise oppressive, the logical course of action is not to give both sides equal empathy or equal consideration. That is not what this book is about. This book is about how to follow multiple lines of logic and not let knee-jerk local empathetic reactions to your favorite people or favorite causes blind you to the realities of decision-making. There are better ways, if you follow the logic all the way out *and* use your emotions, to come up with the best outcomes -- no matter if they are for your personal life, for the wellbeing of whole societies, or affect things on a global scale.Empathy can often lead to dynamics that involve impulsivity, manipulation, logical inconsistencies, and suboptimal outcomes. This is one of the most exciting books in the social sciences to come in a long time. A+** Note: Bloom also clarified what he has come to understand since writing Just Babies. As new evidence filtered in, he saw that he was mistaken about some things and updated his thinking and shared that with his reader. I love any author who updates based on new evidence and is willing to own up to it. (Are you taking notes Dawkins?) ",14,5

29100194,Against Empathy The Case for Rational Compassion,Nicky,"4,138",1003,5,"October 22, 2018","Reviewed for The Bibliophibian.“Against empathy? How could anyone be against empathy?”That was probably my first reaction too, because I and the people around me are all focused on being good to other people, and empathy seems to offer a way to do that. It seems to offer us insight, so we know the right things to say and do. But Paul Bloom’s contention is that empathy doesn’t always lead us in the right direction: he reminds the reader that empathy is what makes us focus on one sick child whose name and face we know, even if we don’t actually know the child is even real, over tens or hundreds of other sick children. Empathy can focus us powerfully on feeling how a single other person “must” be feeling — and therein lies the problem. It’s hard, if not impossible, to empathise with everyone in a whole crowd, and our instincts aren’t always accurate in guessing how other people feel. If they were, then we’d never say exactly the wrong thing when we want to comfort someone who is sad — we’d know what to say.What Bloom isn’t against is compassion: he speaks admiringly of the Buddhist ideal of compassion without attachment, for instance. Compassion linked with reason can indeed guide us to do good, to do the moral thing, to ensure he hurt the least number of people. But empathy — pure “I feel what you feel” emotional attachment leads us astray, and Bloom argues that point well.To empathise is a human emotion that many of us share, and Bloom isn’t claiming it’s inherently a bad thing. That would be to misread the book entirely. Honestly, despite often thinking that empathy is a virtue and people can do more of it, I find it difficult to disagree with Bloom’s conclusions. Part of that is that he writes really clearly, which makes it easy to knee-jerk believe that he’s right, but I think I’ll still be thinking about (and agreeing with) this in a few days, weeks, months.Time to look up Effective Altruism again, and do something with the information this time.",10,N/A

Whether it's making feel-good donations rather than researching to see where our charitable contributions would do the most good, or torturing enemies in the hopes of helping the people we like, that particular type of empathy can be too insular.So in the end, Bloom doesn't want us to stop being kind, but rather to examine our motives and the results more deeply.

He focuses more on the social-science and psych aspects, rather than specific political agendas. He makes the very logical observation that people care more about their immediate family and friends, rather than society at large. Therefore, one must be careful before using feelings to make policy decisions.So why the three stars? Nothing really blew me away. He dances around the distinction between sympathy, empathy, and compassion for a while. He seems to spend most of his time on the defensive, addressing counterarguments, (trying to convince feelings-people that he's not against feelings), rather than making his own arguments. You can hear the influence of people like Gladwell (Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking), but Bloom himself never gets down to brass tacks to fully present his own case.
