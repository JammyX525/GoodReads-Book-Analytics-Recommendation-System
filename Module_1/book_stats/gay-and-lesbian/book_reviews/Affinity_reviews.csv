25337939,Affinity,S.S.,1,15,5,"October 3, 2012","Oh, Sarah Waters, the lesbian Charles Dickens. Some think she’s boring and I totally understand that. Nothing can be more mundane than flowing, ornate sentences filled with imagery strong enough to physically transport you to the setting, right? And don’t get me started on that gorgeous historically accurate Victorian-style prose. I’m half asleep just thinking about her engaging plots and characters. So, yeah, I can definitely see how it can be boring and how you’d rather watch football or something.That was sarcasm, by the way.Okay, cutting the crap and getting down to the review. Yes, there will be spoilers.Affinity is about a spinster (an older, unmarried woman) named Margaret Prior and, boy, has life really messed her up. Her father (whom she loved dearly) is dead, her mom is overbearing and protective and a Bible away from being the mom in Carrie, her former (female) lover is married to her brother and they have a child together. She takes chloral every day for her emotional instability/insomnia, eventually using it to aid in her suicide after the death of her father. Her suicide failed, obviously, so she decided to be a Lady Visitor at Millbank prison, spending her days speaking with convicts.At the prison, she meets quirkily alluring and enigmatic Selina Dawes, a psychic medium incarcerated for a reading gone awry. The two seem to be oddly attracted to one another, the nature of their meetings becoming increasingly intimate (on the emotional level, you pervs. Okay, okay, it was supposed to be romantic, but, ya know, jail cells aren’t the most private places).Throughout the whole thing, there’s an overhanging sense of dread and the entire atmosphere of the book is summed up by: something isn’t right here. After all, Selina seems to be the real deal when it comes to mediums and definitely isn’t a fraud. No, ma’am. No way. Nuh uh. Never ever. Totally honest. Yup.Long story short, the ending is a bit of a mindfuck if you’re like me and start thinking after you finish a book, as opposed to during.A handful of other reviews claim that they didn’t care for the character of Margaret Prior, or that they were angry because she was impressionable, weak, and lacked a backbone. I can assume that these people have also never suffered through the trials of uncontrollable bouts of depression, anxiety, self-identity crises, or any other emotional disorders. They probably have thriving social lives and aren’t afraid of things like spiders or airplanes. This isn’t a bad thing, so be glad that your mental health is squeaky clean and you can’t relate to a hopeless and miserable character. I, on the other hand, am utterly neurotic, so Margaret and I got along like two people at an A.A. meeting. To understand her actions, you had to have been familiar with her state of mind. Her obsessiveness and anxiety so mirrored my own, and that was probably the most frightening part of the book.You see, Margaret’s weakness is what drove the plot. Her infatuation and vulnerability is what kept her coming back to Selina time and time again. The way she desperately latched onto her and put her on a pedestal as basically her saving grace was beautiful in itself.Speaking of their relationship, let me talk about that for a bit. It was adorable, in my opinion. At first, you’re really convinced that this is a genuine type of love and that two people truly found each other at a miserable time in their lives and are now destined to defeat the odds and get married and gain weight and watch reality shows together, happily ever after. But this isn’t Nicholas Sparks — this is a Victorian lesbian dark paranormal anguish-filled melodrama, and it wants you to be sad.All in all, this book was fantastic. The plot twist was intricately crafted, almost to an absurd degree. It contained almost everything I’m interested in, which consists of the paranormal, social stigmas, mental instability, Victorian England, betrayal, superb prose, and lesbians.",261,16
25337939,Affinity,Wendy Darling,"1,519",33800,5,"April 9, 2016","In reading the gothic psychological novel Affinity, it is nearly impossible to shake off an overwhelming feeling of gloom and pervasive dread. Following a failed suicide attempt, a young ""lady visitor"" named Margaret Prior develops a relationship with an inmate named Selina Dawes in a Victorian women's prison, and both their lives are forever changed by their acquaintance.Narrated in alternating chapters by the two very different women, this dark, moody story incites fear, melancholy, and terrible pity. As always, with this author's work comes a thoroughly researched story and a compelling look at women in oppressive circumstances, as well as how their limited choices often lead to desperate attempts to control their own destinies. There's also an erotic undercurrent of forbidden attraction running deep in this novel as Margaret finds herself increasingly drawn to the mysterious Selina Dawes, who has been imprisoned for a spiritualist reading gone horribly wrong. Their subtly blooming attraction is heightened by the misery of the contrast with Selina's living conditions at Millbank Prison (an actual London prison, by the way), and it's a certainty that in Margaret's desire to save Selina, she is also desperate to save herself.And what will your sister do if her husband should die, and she should take another? Who will she fly to then, when she has crossed the spheres? For she will fly to someone, we will all fly to someone, we will all return to that piece of shining matter from which our souls are torn with another, two halves of the same. It may be that the husband your sister has now has that other soul, that has affinity with her soul--I hope it is. But it maybe the next man she takes, or it may be neither. It may be someone she would never think to look to on the earth, someone kept from her by some false boundary...Sarah Waters writes in dense, elegant prose and tells stories that unfold with exquisite deliberation. Affinity is similar to The Little Stranger, in that there are such evocative, spine-chilling moments (including a particularly vivid one involving dripping wax and a dimpled baby's arm :-O ) that I literally had to put the book down and step away from it. She masterfully creates an atmosphere of suffocating melancholy and builds the tension to an almost unbearable point, so that when the characters finally break, there is a blessed emotional release and relief in the confusion and madness that follows. As with all of the authors' novels, it's important not to read too many reviews or interviews lest important surprises are spoiled. I've read enough of her books to know that I needed to pay attention to every word that is uttered, but she still kept me guessing until the devastating end. If you decide to read this, try to save it for a day when it's cold and dreary and drizzling; I did, and my imagination nearly went wild over the awful conditions of the prison, as well as the evocative seances I could picture perfectly in my mind. Affinity isn't the typical jump-out-of-the-closet horror novel, but for the reader who appreciates subtlety and who might feel a fine shiver when things don't feel quite right in the house, it can offer an incredibly suspenseful and terrifying read.",141,58
25337939,Affinity,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,4,"October 22, 2011","As seen on The ReadventurerIt is almost impossible to say anything about the plot of Affinity without spoiling something, so I'll refrain from recapping. A wealthy, depressed old maid starts visiting a women's prison and quickly finds herself taken by an inmate, a young spiritualist - that's all you need to know.Let's talk about feelings instead. This sense of emptiness and despair I am left with is so overwhelming right now, that it leads me to believe I might have liked Affinity even more than Fingersmith. I would go as far as to say what I feel now is pretty close to what I felt after finishing The Blind Assassin.This novel is very strong as a horror-laden/supernatural mystery - the level of suspense and foreboding is very high, but what it conveys even better is the suffocating atmosphere of oppression, repressed sexuality and thinly veiled eroticism and longing for the forbidden. As a woman of the now I have never experienced such a feeling of being completely powerless first hand, but Sarah Waters made me feel all of this for her Victorian heroines. Not many contemporary writers can portray this very time- and class-specific environment. It's hard to top Edith Wharton. But Waters accomplishes it marvelously.",61,15
25337939,Affinity,Siria,"1,715",1226,4,"June 5, 2007","Sarah Waters, at this stage, must be the accepted queen of Victorian Gothic lesbian melodrama; not, I imagine, that there is much competition for this title, but I think it's a deserved one nonetheless.In many ways, the plot of Affinity is like that of the other work of Waters' that I have read, Fingersmith. Crime and Victorian punishment, repression and sexuality and psychology, all feature heavily in both books. Affinity, however, is a much more satisfying novel for me. While it, too, hangs on some often surprising twists of coincidence, these twists are orchestrated by an intelligence that is much more subtle and convincing, to my mind, than the occurrences in Fingersmith (I found those to be much too Dickensian, and I loathe Dickens). And while, admittedly, I never came to feel terribly attached to and moved by Margaret and her plight - she was a little too detached, and her fate a little too obviously signposted - she was undoubtedly a well-drawn character.The real achievement of the book, though, is the sense of period and atmosphere and mood it has. When I closed the book, I had the strongest desire to open all the windows in the room, because I needed sunlight and wind, after spending so long in the airless world that Waters created. It's rare anymore that a book has that effect on me, so I do think that this is one that I will be re-reading and savouring.",43,N/A
25337939,Affinity,Vonia,611,98,4,"September 10, 2017","I have said it before, I will say it again. I cannot fathom how Sarah Waters does it, how she can draw the reader into this entirely other world, this other period, time, place, complete immersion. Even something simple like the protagonist Miss Prior's afternoon in The Spiritualists' Reading Room instantly conceived for me a dim, smoky, velvet lined library where she learns the secrets of her true love/affinity's case. Genius. I honestly do not typically care for the paranormal stories, but under the guidance of Waters, a pretty great read. With the unexpected ending, I admit I did not like it, but then again, I guess it was good, in that way only great writers can have me appreciating an otherwise unacceptable 180. In my opinion, the author better have a damn good reason as well as some damn good transitioning with foreshadowing for these endings. Selina Dawes. What a character. She had me good. I will say that. I guess I was not paying attention, so enraptured by Waters' writing, I was. At least that is what I say. I feel like I should have seen it from a million miles away. Her story was very interesting, although I do wish there was more detail, more insight into her childhood. In fact, I felt like the center of the story told was quite intense, extremely well told, even a little long, but could have used more insight into ""Miss Prior""/Aurora's history, both before + after. As for the Spiritualism, ghosts, seances, readings, etcetera, I actually really liked reading these aspects of the novel, appreciating Waters' obvious research into the themes. Oh, Sarah Waters, how I love thee. ",32,7
25337939,Affinity,Janelle,"1,089",131,5,"September 17, 2021","Oh wow, that was so good! I haven’t read Sarah Waters before and I will definitely be reading more.Set in the early 1870s in London, Margaret Prior, recovering from a suicide attempt after the death of her father, starts visiting the female prisoners in Milbank prison and becomes obsessed with one, Selina Dawes. Selina is a young spirit medium given a four year sentence after a seance went wrong, leaving her patron, Mrs Brink, dead. The book is so well plotted, the story builds, there’s longing and loneliness, the hardships of the prison are described in detail, great atmosphere and it gives an idea of the limitations on women’s lives across class and circumstance. Loved it!",24,6
25337939,Affinity,Misha,364,667,4,"March 18, 2011","""Sexy, Spooky, Stylish"" - that's the blurb on the cover. If I was not a Sarah Waters fan already, I would have picked up the book based on those words. How can you resist a book with that description? After reading the book, I can safely say that those words are an accurate description of Affinity. I will further add to that - ""Haunting and magical.""It seems, I have been reading many deliciously gothic novels recently. Well, I am not complaining! Affinity is yet another addition to my love for anything gothic. Sarah Waters, who is considered the ""Queen of Victorian Gothic novels"", churns out yet another winner.Margaret Prior suffers a complete mental breakdown, following her father's death. A failed suicide attempt breaks her even further. She lives with her domineering mother and a sister, who will soon be married. Margaret feels jealous because she thinks, by marrying, her sister will somehow ""evolve"" while she will remain stagnant. She's constantly under her mother's watchful eyes and is treated like an imbecile. Her former lover, Helen, is now married to her brother - a fact that she is still unable to get over. Margaret is a repressed, closed-up young woman with no hopes for the future.In order to forget her painful past, she becomes a ""lady visitor"" at Millbank Prison. Her job is to talk to the women prisoners, listen to them and guide them towards a more positive direction. She's drawn towards one particular prisoner, Selina Dawes, a spiritualist and a psychic medium, who has been imprisoned for assaulting one of her clients.When you love an author a lot, you tend to develop gigantic expectations from all of that author's books, which is probably unfair. I have not been very subtle about my love for Sarah Waters. Fingersmith and The Little Stranger are not only my favorite books by her, but are also my all-time favorites as well. Perhaps my expectations were very unrealistic. In the beginning I felt a little deflated. Don't get me wrong. The beginning was compelling enough to keep me reading on, but it was just not up to the admittedly unrealistic standards I have set for Sarah Waters' novels. However, this feeling did not last long as the book soon picked up and I was hooked!Affinity is told from both Selina's and Margaret's perspectives. The reader feels as fascinated by Selina as Margaret is. Yet, she still remains an enigma, a mystery throughout the book. The story unfolds slowly, with each chapter pulling you in completely.Selina is viewed as a charlatan, a fraud and a cheat. But the time spent talking to her each day convinces Margaret of her truth. Moreover, there are some strange, extraordinary events which provide further proof of Selina's powers. With each meeting, the magnetic pull , which Margaret feels towards Selina intensifies, leading towards the ultimately shocking conclusion.""We are the same, you and I. We have seen cut, two halves, from the same piece of shining matter. Oh, I could say, I love you—that is a simple thing to say . . . But my spirit does not love yours—it is entwined with it. Our flesh does not love: our flesh is the same . . .""  I deeply felt for Margaret. I felt her frustration and how repressed she was. I can understand how suffocated she felt under her mother's constant nagging. One of the most powerful aspects of Affinity is the setting and the atmosphere the author creates. Millbank prison is like a character in itself - the author's descriptions of the prison is so vivid that you can feel the prisoners' predicament in the controlled and suffocating environment. Margaret's longing for Selina, the unspoken but intense ""forbidden"" emotions and her unhappiness is heartrending and hits you hard. It is as if every poet who ever wrote a line to his own love wrote secretly for me, and for Selina. My blood - even as I write this- my blood , my muscle and every fibre of me, is listening, for her. When I sleep, it is to dream of her. When shadows move across my eye, it is to dream of her, I know them now for shadows of her. My room is still, but never silent - I hear her heart, beating across the night in time to my own.Margaret's stark despair and misery really got to me. My heart was breaking for her all throughout. Sarah Waters has an incredible ability to make you care so much for the characters that they almost become real people to you.Selina's descriptions of her life as a medium and her ability to contact spirits is so real and even mesmerizing, that you believe her without questions or skepticism. Her conversations with the spirits and her experiences creeped me out quite a bit. It unnerved me and fascinated me at the same time.Like most of author's other novels, Affinity has females as the main protagonists and is set in the Victorian era. In addition, the author has eloquently tackled subjects like repression, sexual awakening and spirituality. Three are several feminist elements as well. The author, very subtly, raises questions about a woman's place in the society.""Why do gentlemen's voices carry so clearly, when women's are so easily stifled?"" Margaret, though technically a ""free"" woman, is still a prisoner - to her gender, to her circumstances and to her mother's wishes. "" Women are bred to do more of the same - that is their function. It is only ladies like me that throw the system out, make it stagger...""The ending is probably the best part of the book. I am still reeling from the shock of the end. It was so unexpected; I doubt anyone could have seen it coming. To say I am impressed is an understatement.Like every other Sarah Waters' books, Affinity will remain with me for a long time to come. If I had not read any other books by this author, it would have been a 5 star read for me. Affinity, in my opinion, is not her best, but still a fantastic read. Sarah Wates' lyrical writing makes every book worth it.Now I just have two more books by Sarah Waters to read and then begins the long painful wait for her next book. I believe I can gobble up all of Sarah Waters' books in one go and yet be hungry for more of her brilliance.",23,6
25337939,Affinity,Indieflower,312,90,3,"September 14, 2019","Very atmospheric this one, Sarah Waters is so good at transporting the reader right to the heart of the grimness of Victorian London, or the creepiness of a country house.There's a great sense of time and place and of the stifling life Victorian women were forced to lead. The main character did begin to grate on me after a while, she was somewhat melodramatic and I didn't find myself rooting for her at all. The ending was satisfying and I loved the Gothic feel of the book but I much preferred Fingersmith and The Little Stranger to this one.",20,N/A
25337939,Affinity,Jess,502,117,3,"October 17, 2016"," Have you ever read a book and experienced de ja vu at the ending??? I thought this book was one I haven't read before (I still think so) but at the end.. it seemed vaguely familiar as if I had read it. I wasn't too surprised and thought ""Wait.. I think I read this before."" Chalk it up to the creepy experiences that Margaret Prior experiences through out the book. My thoughts/reactions:-The Victorian prison system was abysmal for inmates. The idea of spending years with the notion of no news of the outside, four visits from family a year, questionable food quality, poor healthcare in poor living conditions, religious reading only, nothing to write with, and your entire focus should be rethinking your life choices and how to be better. It made me wonder if this actually worked as a crime deterrent. There is a repeat inmate in the book so I'm not sure how well it works. -As a woman, you could be imprisoned for a suicide attempt. One inmate made it to the second level for her 7 suicide attempts. She was deemed ""a public nuisance"". Appalling. It makes one wonder how many inmates were truly criminal or suffering from mental illness. -Work must have been so bad there for women to purposefully maim themselves in the forms of tying a rusted button to a cut to induce septicemia, gouging an eye out with a butter knife, swallowing glass, attempting to hang oneself, etc. -For a time period known for it's rigidity and devotion to public propriety; the Victorians were a dramatic emotional lot. It it seemed extremely evident in their writings. I won't sugar coat it; the main character was beginning to get on my nerves with her ruminations and dramatic thinking. Skip the chloral and laudanum... give the girl an SSRI stat. -I think keeping people's hair is so creepy. Sleeping with a braid of hair even more so. -It was an interesting read that at times did creep me out but I didn't respond to this book's alleged ""chilling"" story as many reviewers or book bloggers seemed to. Except for the wax scene in the prison cell; that gave me the creeps.  - This is definitely a thinking sort of a read. I'm sure the more I mull it over; more thoughts on it will come to me. It is incredibly well written. I'd love to hear Waters lecture on the time period. She knows her stuff and crafts a good tale. ",19,N/A
25337939,Affinity,Yvonne G,317,192,4,"February 1, 2021","To pigeon-hole this book in any single genre is really difficult, as it would sit equally well as either a historical mystery/thriller, or a gay/lesbian novel, without being offensive in either.This one is certainly not for you, if you are looking for a light-hearted, uplifting to read, or an ‘escape into’ story, with a happy ever after ending. Just the opposite. This a deep, multi-layered, mysterious and intricate storyline, which is actually fairly disturbing, dark and even depressing.It is however a brilliantly written, well constructed and researched book, which draws you in from the very first page and doesn’t let you go again, until the very last word has been finished.This unconventional, unique and darkly gothic tale of power and possession, that really makes you want to believe in ‘magic’, the further drawn into events you become, brings into stark relief the societal mores of the Victorian era, dealing as it does with lesbianism and suicide, during a period in time when the punishment for either such act, would have been horrific, particularly if you were a ‘lady’, thus immediately transforming the book into a heart-wrenching, profoundly touching love story, for which there can never be a good outcome.The author writes wonderfully visual and descriptive narrative and dialogue, with total confidence, compelling authority and desperate intensity and compassion, which kept me on the edge of my seat and not realising just how quickly I was turning the pages.The story is alternatingly told by Selina and Margaret, who are so well described and developed, as to almost be in the room with me as they speak. So emotionally complex, multi-faceted, raw and passionate, yet unimaginably vulnerable and so totally distant that I was unable to connect with either of them on any level.I must admit that I never saw the twist in the end coming and had thought it would conclude in quite a different way; but it worked just right in bringing the saga to a natural conclusion, although it did rather mess with my mind!",16,16
25337939,Affinity,BrokenTune,747,199,3,"February 26, 2015","""Now I have more freedom than I ever had at any time in my life, and I do only the things I always have."" Affinity - a feeling of closeness and understanding that someone has for another person because of their similar qualities, ideas, or interests. This book was not easy to get into. I'm neither a fan of Dickensian tales of woe nor of paranormal or supernatural stories, so for most of this book I was not convinced I would finish it, never mind like it.  The structure of the book was difficult, too. Chapters jump back and forth in time, and the narrative changes between the characters. I kept having to go back and re-read passages to remember where about in the story I was at - and which character. However, Waters' writing detailing delicious descriptions of life in a Victorian women's prison was awesome. So awesome in fact that I felt like I was there in the bleak and rigid clasp of fear and despair - haunted (haha) by the question if the supernatural could be real. In fact, having read most of the book at night now that the darkness has gripped us up here in the North, made Affinity the perfect read in the run up to Halloween. Affinity, as the title suggests, explores the relationship between different people, focusing mostly on upper-middle-class Margaret Prior, who volunteers to become a lady visitor in a London prison, and Selina Dawes, a notorius medium who has been sent down after being involved in a woman's death. However, affinity applies to other relationships in the book and each of them serves to paint a picture of the main character, Margaret Prior, and her struggle with life in London society during the 1870s.  As I mentioned, the book was a bit of a struggle for me at first but very rewarding in the end. The ending it self has been criticised by others, but I thought it was perfectly fitting, though not anywhere near as polished as the ending Waters' later books.This review was originally posted on BookLikes: http://brokentune.booklikes.com/post/...",16,2
