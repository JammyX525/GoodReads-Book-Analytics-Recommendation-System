1025100,A Boys Own Story,Michael,657,969,2,"April 5, 2019","A series of six short character studies, A Boy’s Own Story charts the emotional and aesthetic development of a sensitive young gay artist. The story follows the unnamed son of a newly rich couple as he struggles to come to terms with his sexuality and reject his conservative upbringing. In elaborate prose, White paints a vivid portrait of an adolescence characterized by shame, confusion, and longing, whether the author’s describing his wealthy protagonist’s first furtive sexual encounter or fleshing out his fraught relationship to his divorced parents. The writing is occasionally moving but often overwritten and derivative of Proust and Mishima; the storytelling also meanders, and the stakes of the plot feel exceptionally low. Worse yet, the novel’s many working-class characters, be they white or Black, are cartoonish and stereotyped. The book was a hit in the eighties, but it’s aged poorly.",73,9
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Fabian,933,1525,4,"January 15, 2019","Elegant prose describing here a unique experience that hardly resembles my own. (The paramount reason I adore fiction!) In this, the truth of the matter. That there are all types, there are many stories. Sexuality is fixed only in our minds. This is no mix between ""Salinger & Wilde."" White is an American Alan Hollinghurst, or sometype bourgeois William Burroughs.",57,5
1025100,A Boys Own Story,mark monday,"1,619",4955,4,"March 14, 2016","Edmund White portrays his younger life in a narcotic and poetic style. not exactly the most flattering self-portrait... the protagonist's travails are emotionally affecting yet he remains creepily distanced from the events and people in his own life - in particular from his equally creepy, distant, self-absorbed father. the apple does not fall far from the tree, i suppose. overall, the language is some of the most beautiful, in my experience, of all of gay fiction - rivaling even Giovanni's Room. the prose is sometimes so gorgeous it becomes hypnotic. the man certainly knows how to write! the episodic nature of the book - in some ways disguised by the circular narrative - is rich with at times dreamy, other times cruelly crystal clear recountings of key moments in this boy's life. i was so impressed by this one that i've forced a couple friends (straight ones) to give it a go. unfortunately, they both found the narrator to be, well... ""poisonous"" would be an accurate word, although i'm sure stronger, angrier words were used. i suppose i can see that. but the narrator is a character of depth, full of wry introspection and canny circumspection. he lives in a marvelously layered and mysterious world, one where he often turns out to be more predator than prey. the whole thing flows together in a way that is impressively cohesive and memorable. a very individualistic achievement in the Gay Coming of Age subgenre. all that, plus i've never read a more sinister depiction of a blowjob in my life!

1025100,A Boys Own Story,Trin,"1,718",543,2,"February 27, 2016","Judging by this book, the average young boy can, before the age of 15, look forward to being approached for sex by:*A 12-year-old ""straight"" baby jock who's really into anal*Not one, but two separate camp counselors*A ""special"" student who wanders around with a constant erection, which everyone just accepts, like, ""Oh hey, it's whatshisname with his perma-boner""*A teacher and his wife looking for a three-way*A totally different teacher*A female black prostitute*A guy in a park who's actually just trying to con you out of $200I think I'm forgetting someone, but hey, you can always fill your downtime with sexual fantasies about your own father!Look, I get that my experience does not in any way equal the universal experience, least of all that of a young gay man from half a century ago. Still, the sexual content of this book is so over the top that I started to feel like, instead of one of the Classics of Gay Literature, I had accidentally acquired an A/B/O fic* in book form. A Boy's Own Story is supposed to be an autobiographical novel, but it has very little narrative: mostly it's a series of incidents, loosely tied together. (The novel's notes reveal that several of the chapters were originally written and published separately, and it shows.) This format only serves to make the narrator's adventures seem more crazed and unlikely -- you reach a point in almost every chapter where you start to distantly hear the bow-chicka-bow-wow music playing. (""Dear Playgirl, all I did was order a pizza, but you'll never believe what happened!"")All that said: White can be a beautiful and descriptive writer. I read this because I loved The Flaneur: A Stroll through the Paradoxes of Paris, a work of nonfiction about wandering around Paris and the history of several marginalized groups there. There are flashes of what made me respond to that book in A Boy's Own Story -- descriptions of the hotel the narrator lives in with his mother and sister, of summer at his father's lake house, of a woman who runs a bookstore. These passages are filled with brilliant, vivid observation. I will definitely be seeking out more of White's nonfiction work.But I eyerolled throughout all of this novel's sexual shenanigans. I must be getting old.(Elderly and cantankerous as I am, I have one last bone to pick, although not with White. Staring out at me from the front of my edition was this blurb from the Chicago Sun-Times: ""The best American narrative of sexual awakening since The Catcher in the Rye."" Um. Did you read The Catcher in the Rye, anonymous Chicago Sun-Times critic from 1982? Or did you just catch the A/B/O AU on AO3? Just checking.)*If you don't know what this is, bask in your innocence",26,7
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Paul Bryant,"2,161",9018,2,"June 19, 2019","What a disappointment. I thought I was an Edmund White fan but it turned out I just like the funny Edmund (The Beautiful Room is Empty, My Lives). There wasn’t the faintest impression of the wan attenuated ghost of any kind of humour in the half that I read. Not whatsoever. This was Serious Edmund, this was Literary Edmund. I just don’t care for that guy. He’s more than somewhat pompous. The other thing, and I haven’t seen any other reviews refer to this, is that right there in chapter one we have a long full-on sex scene between a 15 year old boy and a 12 year old boy. It probably pushed the envelope back in 1982 but now – even though the sex is entirely consensual – and I’m sure it depicted the reality of some teenage experience - it can only make the modern reader uneasy. Maybe I’m turning into a conservative, I don’t know. ",25,1 comment
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Cody,506,175,5,"February 8, 2018","Achingly beautiful...and that's before the ""corn-holing"" even begins. White levels some serious stingers at you in this sucker, written with his customary flair for Proustian filigree. While evidence that a truly fucked up childhood can engender great Art, the beneficiary (me/you/etc) thereof is behooved to ask—Q: Does that justify it?A: No. It can never be worth the manifold tortures adults foist upon their young—physical, psychological, or any variation of both. I think cummings is applicable here:  [you shall above all things be glad and young]you shall above all things be glad and young.For if you're young,whatever life you wearit will become you;and if you are gladwhatever's living will yourself become.Girlboys may nothing more than boygirls need:i can entirely her only lovewhose any mystery makes every man'sflesh put space on;and his mind take off timethat you should ever think,may god forbidand(in his mercy)your true lover spare:for that way knowledge lies,the foetal gravecalled progress,and negation's dead undoom.I'd rather learn from one bird how to singthan teach ten thousand stars how not to dance.",18,6
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Linda ~ they got the mustard out! ~,"1,518",97,2,"May 4, 2022","My lingering impressions of this book are that it was overwritten and that this supposed autobiographical novel about a young teen boy had an awful lot of sex, to a ridiculous degree.

1025100,A Boys Own Story,Proustitute (on hiatus),257,60,4,"August 24, 2019","""Like a blind man's hands exploring a face, the memory lingers over an identifying or beloved feature but dismisses the rest as just a curve, a bump, an expanse. Only this feature—these lashes tickling the palm like a firefly or this breath pulsing hot on a knuckle or this vibrating Adam's apple—only this feature seems lovable, sexy. But in writing one draws in the rest, the forgotten parts. One even composes one's improvisations into a quite new face never glimpsed before, the likeness of an invention. Busconi once said he prized the most those empty passages composers make up to get from one ""good part"" to another. He said such workmanlike but minor transitions reveal more about a composer—the actual vernacular of his imagination—than the deliberately bravura moments. I say all this by way of hoping that the lies I've made up to get from one poor truth to another may mean something—may even mean something most particular to you, my eccentric, patient, scrupulous reader, willing to make so much of so little, more patient and more respectful of life, of a life, than the author you're allowing for a moment to exist yet again.""",9,N/A
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Eric,566,943,4,"November 15, 2007","The last of White's novels that I picked up, and to be honest I wasn't expecting any surprises. Was I stupid! I cringe when I hear this book praised as if it were the first and best thing White ever wrote...but it is very good. After the fervid manner of Nocturnes for the King of Naples (still my favorite of his books) White took to heart Isherwood's advice to write more plainly. The style he achieves in this book is a marvel. A formal chasteness that doesn't trammel lyricism, a clarity that doesn't dry up the sources of mysterious suggestion: I had rowed laboriously over every mile of the lake; it was a mild sort of pleasure to see those backbreaking distances beautifully elided by the Chris-Craft. For Dad had gunned the motors again and we were sitting once more on our high, thundering throne. We passed the point where the clipped lawns of an estate flowed down from a white mansion and its lit, curtained windows. Late last Sunday afternoon, as I was pulling hard through the turbulent water at the point, I'd seen a young man in a seersucker suit and a girl in a party dress. They sauntered up the hill away from me, he slightly in the lead, she swinging her arms high in an exaggerated way, as though she were a marionette. The sun found a feeble rainbow in the mist above a sprinkler and made the grass as green and uniform as baize. The light gave the couple long, important shadows.",8,N/A
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Ellinor,483,243,4,"February 17, 2015",A Boy's Own Story is about a young boy's coming of age and his coming out in the 1950s. It is told in a very sensitive voice and the language used is very beautiful. At the beginning of the book there is a very explicit sex scene. I was quite surprised at that because I had never expected that. I've read a lot of books by John Irving who especially in his later work uses a lot of sex scenes as well but never anything like that.I always enjoy reading coming of age stories including the ones set at boarding schools and this book was no exception. I often disliked the main character (particulary at the end) but the book was still great and I'm looking forward to reading the next volume in this trilogy.(I received a free digital copy via Netgalley/the publisher. Thanks for the opportunity!) ,8,N/A
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Conor Ahern,655,188,3,"December 10, 2017","When I first started reading this, I couldn't figure out why I had never heard about it before: the writing is really quite good. But then I realized that for all of his belletrism, White doesn't really write about anything very compelling or interesting. Sure there's some smut and the carefree (if shopworn) experience of the rich white boy away at boarding school, wearing his immunities to consequence like his house's heraldic colors. But nothing much goes on.I read this because it's the first in a series the second of which I will have to read to lead a bookclub discussion in January. We shall see how the next installment stacks up!",8,3
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Jessica Sullivan,518,417,3,"February 24, 2018","This groundbreaking novel about a gay teenage boy coming of age in the 1950s is full of nostalgia and the yearning to be comfortable with oneself. The narrator recalls snippets of his formative years in which he struggles with his sexuality and the sense of shame that accompanies his then-forbidden desires. The writing is elegant and the story is an important one to tell, though I found certain sections to be far more affecting and compelling than others. This was an uneven read for me, though I'm glad I read it.",8,1 comment

1025100,A Boys Own Story,Craig Maxwell,197,12,3,"August 14, 2017","A strong 3.5!""Is it real wet and slippery in there? Some guy told me it was like a wet liver in a milk bottle""One of the many weird and funny quotes from this book. A boy's own story follows a young boy's story and his relationship with his family and exploring his sexuality. It isn't what you would expect to be from the outset, which makes is quite refreshing. I had some problems while reading the book, for example, A boy that is 15 that is goes from calling his father ""daddy"" in a child like manner to then describing events in his life like a memoir in an elaborate emotive language. The text jumps from basic narration to suddenly describing his feeling in a deeply metaphorical way - It almost seems as though the author is writing a memoir of his life, but became confused in whether it was him reflecting or him in the moment. One minute he is a fifteen year old helpless boy, the next a 45 year old librarian. It does get a little bit confusing.There are parts of the story that I can however really relate to, a lot of the internal dialogue that the main character has I could find myself finding similarities. Also with how society views gay people. The protagonist has lots of character traits that I can relate to so that made it enjoyable for me.Chapter 4 was one of my favourite intros, the character analysis is so vivid, I could almost smell the cigarette being put out of the woman that worked in the bookshop.My major criticism would be that the author focuses on minor details and then races through the important ones, and it becomes extremely frustrating while reading! It also felt extremely long for the size of the book, I read longer books far quicker but there wasn't really anything to keep me hooked.Overall I did like it despite the ranty review! It felt really fresh and I enjoyed how weirdly relatable it was. ",6,2
1025100,A Boys Own Story,Patrick,38,3,4,"September 4, 2007","An account of growing up queer when growing up queer wasn't as mainstream as it is today. I think will appeal almost universally to a gay audience, but also to anyone who has felt different or like an outsider. It also deals with some interesting father-son issues. ",6,N/A
