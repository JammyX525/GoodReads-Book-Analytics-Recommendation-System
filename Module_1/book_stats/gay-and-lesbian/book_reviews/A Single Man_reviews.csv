16842,A Single Man,Toby,827,325,5,"April 1, 2014","Christopher Isherwood has written a book that makes me hate him. Or maybe I hate myself? The main theme of this book is loss; loss of a lover, loss of youth, loss of identity, loss of direction, it's all there in beautifully phrased observations and it tickled that spot in my mind, the spot where I hide all of my fears, until I could no longer ignore the fact that I am and I continue to lose these things myself until one day the devastating and unthinkable will happen and I will lose that which I hold most important. It's not my hair, for once.
  “The perfect evening...lying down on the couch beside the bookcase and reading himself sleepy...Jim lying opposite him at the other end of the couch, also reading; the two of them absorbed in their books yet so completely aware of each other's presence.”
Isherwood's novel demonstrates how repressed my fears are, and so does my natural reaction of making a silly joke about my hair. This book does this to me and whilst I love that I am seen reading such wonderful literature on a train when either side of me are people with the latest mega bestsellers with no words bigger than two syllables and all the feeling of my hand after I've slept on it all night, I'm not sure I am mature enough (or willing) to deal with the consequences.
  “Think of two people, living together day after day, year after year, in this small space, standing elbow to elbow cooking at the same small stove, squeezing past each other on the narrow stairs, shaving in front of the same small bathroom mirror, constantly jogging, jostling, bumping against each other’s bodies by mistake or on purpose, sensually, aggressively, awkwardly, impatiently, in rage or in love – think what deep though invisible tracks they must leave, everywhere, behind them!”
 I didn't really want to discuss the fact that Christopher Isherwood was a gay man and that his protagonist is a gay man but it seems that a lot of people can't get past that fact. Top shelves = GLBT etc. and perhaps when this was written it really was unique to write about a gay man AS IF HE WAS A NORMAL HUMAN BEING but to me George is not defined by his sexuality, he is defined by his humanity and as such that should really be the end of it. This is not a great piece of gay literature, this is a great piece of literature full stop. If that offends you I shall not apologise.
  “No one ever hates without a cause....”
I feel that to discuss this book any further would be to ruin it for you, it is 152 pages of quite large font, all you need to know beyond this is that it's also an incredibly uplifting and life affirming day-in-the-life narrative.",191,38
16842,A Single Man,Candi,598,4532,5,"August 18, 2021","4.5 stars“I mean, what is this life of ours supposed to be for? Are we to spend it identifying each other with catalogues, like tourists in an art gallery? Or are we to try to exchange some kind of a signal, however garbled, before it’s too late? You answer me that!”This book beckoned to me with its promising tone and themes. I heard its siren call of introspection. Reading it with a distracted mind the week before a vacation, I absentmindedly staggered into its trap. By the time I was finished, I was literally quite stunned. Actually, if I’m totally honest, I was downright furious. What I needed was a nice bit of quiet time away to mull this one over. So that’s exactly what I did. I made a point of stopping to think about this whenever there was a break in activity. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that Christopher Isherwood wasn’t directly pointing his finger at me through his character, George. Rather, it seemed that George represented an entire slice of our humanity, whether or not we could directly relate to his individual circumstances or not. “Someone has to ask you a question before you can answer it. But it’s so seldom you find anyone who’ll ask the right questions. Most people aren’t that much interested.…”I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. There’s a reason that there are so many novels shining a glaring spotlight on loneliness. Isolation, alienation, despair – these are almost universally guaranteed to happen to each one of us at some point in our lives, if not off and on for the span of a lifetime. We are more likely to suffer these than we are to be ensured an existence full of love, laughter, the pursuit of happiness, and all such similar banalities. Does that mean the pursuit is not worth it then, after all? Well, at first I thought perhaps this was indeed the case. Why bother, when there is so much suffering in the world? Is it fair for one person to be happy when the next is quite clearly heartsick? Cue this reader descending into a temporary gloom. “… the overpowering sloth of sadness is upon him. The sloth that ends in going to bed and staying there until you develop some disease.”Thankfully, there was a perfect gap in time between reading this book and a much needed vacation. This past year has been hellish for a number of people, for a number of reasons. My personal gripes are neither here nor there, rather inconsequential in the general scheme of things. What is important is “now”! We have to live in the moment, don’t we? That’s what I’ve decided to do. I’m not going to pine for “before”. I’m not waiting around for “later” to get here. George did teach me a little something after all. I’m not angry anymore. Well, not really. There are vibrant places to discover, rewarding friendships to nourish, and a whole lot of life left to truly live. “I am alive, he says to himself, I am alive! And life-energy surges hotly through him, and delight, and appetite. How good to be in a body—even this old beat-up carcass—that still has warm blood and live semen and rich marrow and wholesome flesh!”",161,104
16842,A Single Man,Paul,"1,143",1908,5,"June 1, 2021","An astounding piece of work; a day in the life of novel. The day belongs to George Falconer; an English professor in his 50s (English by nationality as well) teaching in southern California. It is set in the early 1960s. George’s lover Jim has recently died suddenly and he is alone again. The novel takes us from waking to breakfast, to travelling to work and so on. This doesn’t have the grandiosity of Joyce; it is much more straightforward and focuses living each day because of life’s brevity. The novel is about loss, but it is also about being an outsider (in this case gay, a foreigner, middle-aged, alone); most of all it is about being human and we share George’s day, his hopes and fears. The interactions with Charlotte and Kenny are wonderfully poignant (and very funny). The prose is beautiful. Some stream of consciousness novels can be hard work, but this one just flows; it could so easily have become sentimental because of the focus on loss, but it does not. The everyday occurrences are well described; dinner with a friend, teaching class (George’s interior monologue is wonderful), a flirtation, swimming in the sea (admittedly only everyday if you live near it!) and the normal activities of all our lives; even driving a car.Isherwood is really asking “How do we live?” “How do we get through life?” There are no answers but the ending is truly great and you will you a long way to find a better one in literature. Isherwood not only describes being alone well, he also captures being in a relationship with another;“The perfect evening...lying down on the couch beside the bookcase and reading himself sleepy...Jim lying opposite him at the other end of the couch, also reading; the two of them absorbed in their books yet so completely aware of each other's presence.”The descriptions of the physical geography of the house, as it is lived in alone and the contrast with two people living in the same small space is just brilliant. This is just a great novel and I would urge everyone to read it. There is a certain level of melancholy, but there is warmth, hope and great humanity.",117,15
16842,A Single Man,Steven Godin,"2,280",2148,5,"October 1, 2016","Even though there are positive reviews aplenty I still had concerns this would turn out to be an overly melodramatic letdown, but needn't have worried as what we have here is a compressed work of utter brilliance from a vastly undervalued writer who does not waste a single word making the reading experience flawless. There are two thing in particular to highlight that nailed it for me, firstly I do not believe Isherwood set out with the intention of writing a story wholly about about homosexuality but to create a universal character in George Falconer who comes across just like everybody else meaning he is easy to relate to. Secondly although deeply shattering in it's portrayal of a man grieving for his partner there is something almost life affirming in how George's bereavement is told that not only showcases how to do sad without being depressing, but also what love and affection means in it's truest sense regardless of the sex of a partner. A phenomenal small novel written with total heart and soul. ",117,12
16842,A Single Man,Robin,473,2486,5,"January 30, 2020","Ever feel lonely? Ever lose someone irreplaceable? Feel like their absence is the lion's share of what you're carrying around in that body of yours, and the only way you can drag that collection of cells through life is by putting on a face, an act, a show?Christopher Isherwood captured that painful status in this small, marvellous book. George has lost Jim. And now George is bewilderingly alone - not melodramatically so, but the opposite. Mundanely alone. Sitting-on-the-toilet kind of alone. He's alienated - a British guy in America, a gay man in 1960s suburbia, knocking around his house, which is small, yes, but feels cavernous now with no Jim.So in these pages is the account of one day in the life of George. Taking his collection of cells to work, to the outer world, trying to make his puzzle piece fit, even though it is misshapen by grief.It's miraculous how relatable it is, how any reader can recognize that void George feels, that play-acting at living he forces himself to do.And it's not going to depress you in the way you might think. Because it's so damn beautiful - it's about loss, yes, but it's just as much about life, and picking yourself up, and running into the ocean naked at night with someone you barely know - while you still can.Plus, if you're lucky enough to have seen the film (which is excellent), it brings to mind George on the big screen, and that's never a bad thing:",95,47
16842,A Single Man,Evan,"1,072",726,5,"May 22, 2016","This book is a truly beautiful thing; a completely exquisite experience. Page after page it spoke to me, as eloquently and profoundly as any book I've ever read. It was sad and funny and wise and observant without ever becoming sentimental or maudlin.In 186 pages of concentrated, yet langorous, stream-of-consciousness prose Isherwood gets to the heart of what it means to be a middle-aged man, a loner, a fish out of water, an expatriate on several levels -- as a Britisher in a new land, a gay man in mid-century America, a man who thinks of himself as an outsider and a social animal at the same time; as a human, temporarily privileged to be in the land of the living. Death is always on his mind, which makes his yearning to live all the more powerful and poignant.The book has no plot, per se. It is one day in the life of George, a British professor of English lit teaching at a small college near LA. It begins with him waking up in bed and his realization of the process of becoming conscious, of being alive, of being here and now. It proceeds through memories of his life, and the recent death of his partner, Jim. It takes us through his day, teaching his seemingly oblivious young charges and privileges us with his sly, wry and oddly generous observations on American social mores, customs and materialism of the 1950s-early 1960s. It shows us his distanced relations with his neighbors, his platonic and touching relationship with fellow expat, Charlotte, his journeys to the grocery and to a bar, and his fledgling potential love relationship with a young student. The book is clearly meant to be read as a first-person POV narrative, yet is told from the omniscient standpoint, referring to George as ""he."" It's in keeping with George's own tendency to step back and look at himself within the big picture.Despite the tinge of sadness throughout, the book is often wickedly funny, and always full of magnificent insight.Finding a Holy Grail book like this is what readers live for. I'm quite floored by it, and very grateful to have found it. A new favorite.(KevinR@Ky 2016; very slightly amended)(2016: As of this date I still have not seen the film version, which I possess in my film collection. I'm actually not eager to see it because the book was so fulfilling.)",81,14

    He pictures the evening he might have spent, snugly at home, fixing the food he has bought, then lying down on the couch beside the bookcase and reading himself slowly sleepy. At first glance, this is an absolutely convincing and charming scene of domestic contentment. Only after a few instances does George notice the omission which makes it meaningless. What is left out of the picture is Jim, lying opposite him at the other end of the couch, also reading; the two of them absorbed in their books yet so completely aware of each other's presence.
  
Christopher Isherwood's ""A Single Man"" is a relatable and convincing study of the loss of a beloved person in your life and the aftereffects of dealing with the empty void left behind. We are introduced to our protagonist George, a middle-aged man who has been attached to a man, Jim, who has recently died in an accident. The status of his relationship with Jim is never clearly stated, though it is heavily implied they shared a sexual relationship and were a couple until Jim's untimely death. Exploring the theme of homosexuality, Isherwood never ponders about the usual subjects authors can write about when developing gay or lesbian characters: George's relationship with Jim and the other men in his life is depicted as something entirely normal, which is exactly the way it should be done.George is a college lecturer who tells his students things like ""a minority is only thought of as a minority when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority, real or imaginary. And no threat is ever quite imaginary... minorities are people; people, not angels."" His homosexuality is never clearly defined; Isherwood refuses to even once use terms such as gay or homosexual, though the overall subject of the novel is clearly implied in the context and the underlying tone of the narrative. 
  
    I'm like a book you have to read. A book can't read itself to you. It doesn't even know what it's about. I don't know what I'm about.
  
This is a book about clinging to the past, about the importance of forgetting in order to start living again, about how to be truly happy. Philosophical in his novel's depth, yet never exaggeratedly philosophical in his style, Isherwood confronts his readers with a number of important questions about life itself, the importance of past, present and future and how to deal with what lies behind and what lies ahead of you.The writing style requires some time to get used to. When I first started reading the book a short time after watching the movie starring Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, I was thrown back by the writing. Between the most notable parts of the text, Isherwood likes to ramble on and on about the daily life of our protagonist, and as important as it may be for setting the mood, I personally found it difficult to keep my attention on the prose. However, especially in the second half of the novel, the dominance of those parts is more and more reduced, until we come to the ending, an ending which I am likely not going to forget because it simply was so surprisingly well-written.""A Single Man"" is clearly not a novel for everyone, considering that hardly anything is ever happening in this novel and we mostly only get insight on the characters' thoughts and the process of his character development - the latter, by the way, being an aspect which Isherwood understood to embody very believably. It took some time for me to get accustomed to the novel's style and to get the images from the movie out of my head in order to appreciate the book for what it is and to judge it separately from the on-screen adaptation. It's a great book which touches many interesting and important subjects without referring to stereotypical methods to convey them, though in my opinion it's also a book which is hard to recommend to anybody. In ""99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939"", Anthony Burgess calls this novel ""a fine piece of plain writing which haunts the memory"", and I couldn't agree more.",64,18

Artifact indeed--more valuable because it is truly a piece of Isherwood's heart, it is semi autobiographic; our hero George is an Englishman living in L.A.! But he is depressed, he is experienced... this day, like Clarissa Dalloway's, will be special. Personally, I really admired the way White Privilege is portrayed and dissected in this novel. George is an outsider, but not un-White, not un-learned. He fights for his rightful place... as an Outsider!",47,2

It’s one day and a long night in the life of a mid fifties gay English professor of English in California at the end of November 1962, and it’s a mordantly melancholic rumination on being past it but not wanting to be. At one point he looks in the mirror and thinks legs are quite good, chest muscles don’t sag, but – sadly –The neck is loose and scraggy under all circumstances, in all lights., and would look gruesome even if he were half-blind. He has abandoned the neck altogether, like an untenable military position.This story is all about grief – George’s lover Jim recently died in a car crash (naturally the family didn’t expect George to attend the funeral as he was just Jim’s “room mate”). George is trying not to spiral down, he still likes to ogle other men and flirt with his pupils. He is trying to make life go on, as it should go on, like when they tell you “well, life must go on”.There are some great bits of early sixties casual sexism to be found here. George’s colleague says his wife recently got a job :“We’re in the chips since I put Marinette to work.”(What a name, Marinette. Kind of like marionette.)George says“So you’re fixing your own breakfast?”And the guy says“Oh, I can manage. Till she gets a job nearer. Or I get her pregnant.”Later George spends an evening with his English neighbour lady friend Charley and we get a page of very judgy comments about her ending up withOh, and if she must wear sandals with bare feet, why won’t she make up her toenails?Well, of course, being gay in the early 60s meant having to adroitly fend off the judginess of absolutely everybody as you earnestly pretended to be straight, so we should let him off. I was sorry to finish A Single Man, since that means I’ll have to go back to Buddenbrooks now.",45,6
16842,A Single Man,Jacob Overmark,200,9,5,"September 8, 2017","We never meet Jim in person. This is George after Jim. A middle-aged man caught between daydreams and nightmares, adhering to the conformity of life in the daytime, drowning his sorrows - well knowing that the little devils can swim - in alcohol at night. Taking exercise, working hard, and allowing himself daydreaming a little once again, ´cause there MUST be a life after Jim, except there isn´t. How do you cope when your lover is gone, killed in a car crash, a lover you even can´t admit the love to openly? Is “living on” denouncing the love and life you shared? George don’t know, or can’t decide for himself. He just goes on, not hoping that time will heal, for it will never. Being lonely though surrounded be people is George´s new identity, the one he slowly and often with a slight hang-over puts on every morning, George without Jim. To have loved and lost.The pain George feels is unfolded expertly and with such empathy to the reader, that it is hard not the shed a tear.The novel is often claimed to be Christopher Isherwood’s masterpiece, and I can only support that.

It doesn't even know what it's about. I don't know what I'm about.""I have watched the movie adaptation when it was released in 2009 and I loved it a lot but never read this book. I wanted to rewatch that movie again but this time I promised myself to read the book first before watching the movie. The first thing I have to say is that the writing of Christopher Isherwood is so beautiful, very poetic, and has so much depth to it. His words make you feel like you are in the middle of the ocean unaware of where the waves will take you. This is one of those stories that we call a slice of life. We follow the main character George an English professor who lost his partner Jim in an accident. We get to know one day of his life, but as you read you will understand how George is grieving and how he is playing a double life. In that one day we get to know some characters he meets and the way he interacts with them and what do they mean to him.One thing you have to keep in mind is that the story depends a lot on the stream of consciousness. The book hardly has any plot but the reader gets a glimpse of each character's little story and George's opinion about them. Characters like Doris, Charlotte, and Kenney play an important role in that one day. To me, it felt that this one day of George's life was an important one the way he forgave Doris without explicitly expressing it to her and his meeting with Charlotte and their exchange of opinions & grief regarding those who are not in their life. That day comes to an end in a poetic way that leaves a strong impact on the reader. I give A Single Man 4.0 beautiful stars out of 5.0.",41,3
16842,A Single Man,Netta,172,131,5,"January 14, 2018","I wouldn’t dare to write anything about someone’s absence and how it bares you, as it is already there, tightly packed into this mesmerizing little book. We never truly experience what absence is till it’s too late, don’t we? That’s why we are never prepared. A Single Man, to me, is a novel about Jim-less George and his pain which feels too real to absorb - palpable and ugly, physical and raw, at times almost disgusting. What’s more important (and what I discovered reading this book for the second time) is that this novel tells you how much of what you had thought was your truest self is lost in the transition between someone’s presence and absence in your life. It’s not about learning to live without someone, it’s about learning to live with yourself once again, on your own. ",41,2

There’s no fuss, no wasted words and unnecessary drama (or any hot sex scenes). It all happens in a beautiful dream-like kind of way. It all happens in the reader’s mind. “To say time is evil because evil happens in time is like saying the ocean is a fish because fish happen in the ocean.”There is a lot packed in these pages but at the same time everything’s so simple and straightforward that I really don’t want to give too much away.Just read it.You’ll not regret it.One life.

16842,A Single Man,James,83,88,4,"December 2, 2020","I went into this anticipating a well-written but somewhat dated glimpse at what life was like for white gay men in the early 1960's. I knew it was first published in 1964 and considered an early gay classic for its candid, boldly sympathetic depiction of a homosexual man. What I did not anticipate, however, was for this to be as timeless and transcendent as it is, traversing the distance of decades to resonate deeply with me as a middle-aged, “out” gay man in the 21st century. Sure, there are references to Cuba, the Cold War, ""Negroes,"" the rise of the suburbs, the stigmatization and even criminalization of homosexuality in American society, etc., that situate this in a very specific time and place. But this slim volume (I read it in one night) tells a much more profound and universal story about the pain and loneliness of feeling like an outsider, a performer, an imposter in a world where one's true self isn't welcomed or fully understood.This short novel spans a day in the life of George, a gay, middle-aged, semi-closeted English professor still grieving the recent tragic death of his partner. We follow George throughout every ordinary, routine part of his day: taking a morning shit, making breakfast, driving to work, teaching class, visiting the gym, getting drunk with his best female friend, etc. Think James Joyce's Ulysses, had Leopold Bloom been a single gay man living in Southern California in the early 1960's. Just simpler, shorter, and far more accessible! 😉We become the most intimate of confidantes for George, learning his deepest emotions and darkest fears. Every bittersweet memory; every cruel, selfish impulse; all of the humor, rage, lust, grief, despair, and unexpected, defiant joy he encounters throughout the course of this ordinary day. George isn't always the easiest or most pleasant company to keep, and some chapters are more compelling than others. The section where he teaches his college class, for example, drags on way too long and gets bogged down in tedious academic minutiae. But then I suppose the tedium is part of the point! This is one of those books that sneaks up on you when you're not looking. And what emerges by the end of the day is a mesmerizing, melancholy, quietly devastating meditation on loneliness, loss, aging, desire, and how one navigates and survives in a world where one never truly fits or completely belongs. (That scene on the beach near the end is one of the most beautiful and haunting passages I've read all year).",32,21
