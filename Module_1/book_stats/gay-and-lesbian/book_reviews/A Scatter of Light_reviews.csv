60093178,A Scatter of Light,Alwynne,523,482,4,"July 27, 2022","A bittersweet story of first love and loss set in rural California in 2013. At first, I thought this slow-burning tale might turn out to be too languid to connect with, but, as it unfolded, I realised the pacing perfectly matched the atmosphere and the setting of a long summer filled with longing. It‚Äôs told from the perspective of a Chinese-American woman Aria, who‚Äôs looking back at her 18-year-old self, reliving the moment between leaving behind school and her childhood, and moving towards independence. A slut-shaming scandal at Aria‚Äôs school has led to a form of exile, now she‚Äôs spending the holidays alone with her widowed grandmother. Her grandmother Joan's a prominent painter/photographer, once part of the performance art scene in the 60s, whose work stimulates Aria‚Äôs imagination. And it‚Äôs at her grandmother‚Äôs house that Aria meets Steph, a genderqueer musician, who changes her idea of who she is and what she might become. This has been billed as a companion novel to Last Night at the Telegraph Club although on the surface they‚Äôre vastly different in style and structure. But Aria‚Äôs growing connection to the local lesbian community gradually establishes a link. Through Aria‚Äôs experiences Lo‚Äôs able to explore the changes in California since the Telegraph Club era: the vibrant, public queer scene, and above all the landmark passing of a law enabling gay marriage. Aria still struggles with some of the issues that Lily faced in Lo‚Äôs earlier novel, casual racism, confusion over her identity. But she also has access to cultural spaces, ways of being, and networks that barely existed when Lily came of age in the 1950s. Through Aria‚Äôs family, Lo also gives us a glimpse of what happened to Lily and to Kath in the years since the end of their story. Although I have to admit there were stretches of this novel that felt a little too drawn out, I loved the strong sense of place and so many of the small details: the exploration of women‚Äôs creativity; the recognition of the influence of Asian-American, lesbian artists like Bernice Bing; Aria‚Äôs fascination with astronomy, light and stars. As well as the many, unexpectedly-moving passages. Closer to Lo‚Äôs earlier work ‚Äì it‚Äôs a book she‚Äôs been trying to write for over ten years ‚Äì and perhaps not as instantly absorbing or as richly textured as her previous book, but still well worth the time.

60093178,A Scatter of Light,Mallory,972,51,5,"October 10, 2022","This is a beautifully written story of a girl caught between past and future coming into herself and her queer identity. Set primarily in 2013 after the Supreme Court found that banning same sex marriages violates equal protection under the law. Aria is 18 and it is the summer between high school and college. She had lots of summer plans which fell apart after a boy took pictures of her without a shirt on and published them on the internet. She is quickly uninvited and her parents feel she needs the supervision of her grandmother for the summer. The first person she meets is Steph, her grandmother‚Äôs gardener and she quickly makes friends with Steph and her group of friends who all happen to be queer. Aria is soon. Caught off guard by feelings of a crush on Steph which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if Steph wasn‚Äôt in a relationship with another girl in the group Lisa. The summer is full of reflection for Aria.

60093178,A Scatter of Light,emma,129,78,5,"October 9, 2022","malinda lo has done it again. after last night at the telegraph club i did not think it was possible for me to love a queer novel to the extremes that i loved that one again, but, boy, was i wrong. a scatter of light is a rather worthy successor to the novel that came before it. whilst this may not be a direct continuation from one to the other, thanks to lo‚Äôs inclusion of a beautiful snapshot of lily and kath‚Äôs five-decade relationship that has been recognised by the united states after gay marriage was legalised in california, the ties between the two are evident. ‚Äùeveryone was smiling, but none looked as happy as lily and kath, who were gazing at each other rather than the photographer. i zoomed in on lily and kath‚Äôs faces, feeling an unexpectedly vivid connection to them both, as if i could sense the love between them glowing like a radiant sun. after so many years, they could show their love to the world at last.‚Äùa scatter of light is a coming-of-age novel centred around aria west, a teenage girl sent to her grandmothers for the summer after topless photos of her go viral on the internet at the hands of a guy. she arrives thinking of the trip as a punishment, wishing for a summer with her friends and cute boys, but leaves at the end of the summer, having spent weeks on end with a group of lesbians close in age led by her grandmother‚Äôs gardener steph, broken-hearted and with the confidence that comes after discovering a part of yourself that you never knew could be attributed to you and who you truly are. this is a story of discovery, a story of owning up to who you are, a story of meeting the one person who as a queer individual changes everything for you. it is a story of heartbreak, a story of your first love that may or may not have been love, and finally, a story many of us will be familiar with.i know that coming-out stories are nothing new. many argue that we have plenty, especially coming out stories centred around young people. the debate surrounding whether we need more is out there, and so i think that this novel strengthens the case for the need for more. when done right, as exemplified here throughout this novel, there is a sense of understanding. for many of us until it clicks on a random day in a random year, more times than not due to one specific individual that rocks our world and everything you have ever thought about ourselves, we never imagine the possibility that being queer is something that is a part of us. aria goes through this, and lo understands the process. it is a process that often ends in heartbreak, and here it does. this is something we so very rarely see, something that twisted my heart at how aria did everything she could to keep her first love that was not right for her. this may be a love story, but at its heart this is a story of realisation, for us, by one of us, that spares no detail or acts as if one‚Äôs coming-out process is easy nor one that ends in happiness with that first romance. ‚Äùshe tasted like saltwater oysters. i was in love with all of her. i was not myself anymore; i was hers.‚Äùhere, lo delivers the next addition of proof that she is, or rather is shaping up to be, the finest author for lesbian, or more broadly, queer fiction.thank you to netgalley and hodder & stoughton for the arc. it was an honour to read this, and i certainly will be buying a physical copy to treasure. as always, any quotation scattered throughout this review is from the arc i was sent and therefore may not entirely correlate with the final published work.",37,2

  ‚Äúall at once i could see who i was becoming as opposed to who i once was. i was split in two: my future and my past. i wanted to remain here on the edge between by two selves, doubly exposed, all hunger and heart.‚Äù

60093178,A Scatter of Light,jenn,168,81,5,"June 18, 2022","‚Äúit was astonishing, and i remember it even today: the realization that the world was not as it seemed. that the stars that appeared to hang motionless above me both moved and did not move, because the earth below me was not actually still. that what i saw might not be reality, but that it was possible to understand it through careful observation, through the instruments that scientists had built to peer into space.‚Äùwhile writing this review, all i can think is ‚Äúno thoughts, just tears and anger.‚Äù and yet, as i pull a somehow comprehensible review out of my ass, i want you to know that i have never meant that more. i sit here in complete awe of this free-spirited story, because it was so far from what i was expecting, from my telegraph-club shaped vision of 2013 and malinda lo. as i got into it, i let go of anything i knew, and just let this story drive me. let aria make mistakes and fall in love with others and art and life, and talk to me. before i knew it i was sobbing.let‚Äôs rewind. it‚Äôs 2013, and aria tang west, resident new-englander, is barred from her planned summer trip to martha‚Äôs vineyard with her besties before she goes to MIT in the fall. instead, she‚Äôs sent to joan‚Äôs house, her artist grandma who lives in marin county of california‚Äôs bay area. fog, ocean, wind, art, and a large number of gay weddings given california‚Äôs law allowing same sex marriage that just passed. aria tang west, meet steph. joan‚Äôs butch gardener steph. enter: the lesbians.leaving you on that cliffhanger from my riveting retelling, because aria tang west? i didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd like her. i can‚Äôt explain it, but she‚Äôs eighteen and pretty and smart and popular. and then,,, of course. malinda lo knows how to write better than just about anyone. aria is messy and brave and as she meets steph and her friends, as she falls in love with this new world of people and art and dykes, i get her. i think this book doesn‚Äôt live in a realm of plot, it just exists. do i think it‚Äôs as versatile as telegraph club was? not at all. but that‚Äôs so special. it‚Äôs about aria and steph and a life-changing summer and joan and her art and aria‚Äôs passion for science-y things and being in such a specific, in-between point in your life.this book is going to be pitched nonstop as a companion novel to last night at the telegraph club. i was promised closure with lily and kath, and that didn‚Äôt disappoint, but as much as i loved hearing a similar voice to telegraph club, familiar tones and a sort of parallel action, i think it‚Äôs almost stronger to let this book be on it‚Äôs own. malinda lo cinematic universe if you will: lily hu on one plane, aria tang west on another, tears and sobs connecting them. i‚Äôm sending love to anyone who needs it right now, because the way this book made me tremble and basically collapse in on myself in sadness and shock driven sobs was humbling. so, i love you. stay safe out there.thank you penguin teen for an advance readers copy in exchange for an honest review! out october 4.content warnings: release of nude photos without consent, hospitalization, death of a family member",22,1 comment

60093178,A Scatter of Light,Madison,566,309,4,"April 27, 2022","I enjoyed this a lot, but it has nothing in common with Telegraph Club.I will say, as someone who was 20 in 2013, that Malinda Lo gets that part exactly right. the inexorable descent into queer toxicity was cringey and laughable only in that it felt so, so true. Steph and Mel and Lisa feel like people I knew. You can see what's coming from a mile away, and it's so painfully real and accurate to my experience. I loved that aspect. This book more closely resembles Malinda Lo's foray into contemporary fiction from the mid 2010s, which makes sense because she says in the acknowledgements that that's when this book began percolating. Telegraph Club had a richness of scene, a bigness to it that's totally absent here. A Scatter of Light holds up as contemporary (or, shudder, historical) fiction, but it's not winning the National Book Award. I also thought the connections between Aria and Lily/Kath felt shoehorned and unnecessary, and didn't really add anything to the story, though they make up a huge part of the pre-pub marketing for this book. This book stands up well on its own, so none of that feels needed.Will teens like this book? Who knows! But I, a 28-year-old, saw my life in it, and I can't wait to talk to my friends about it when it comes out. ",18,N/A
60093178,A Scatter of Light,Andy,"2,354",175,5,"October 5, 2022","Thank you to Penguin Teen and Netgalley for an eARC in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.Wow I cried so much at the end of this.A Scatter of Light follows Aria Tang West as she is sent out to live with her grandmother for a summer. Aria expects to be bored the whole summer, but then she meets Steph, her grandmother‚Äôs gardener. Steph brings Aria into her friend circle (which happens to be a bunch of lesbians) and shows Aria the queer scenes in Cali. Aria then begins to question her sexuality, especially when she can‚Äôt get Steph off her mind. This book is a journey of questioning. Coming into who you are. Figuring who you are after loss. Navigating toxic friendships and forging new stronger bonds. I loved everything about this book. It had it all for me. The last 20% or so had me sobbing the whole way through. This one has small cameos of characters from LNATTC, but it‚Äôs not a full on sequel. Aria‚Äôs story is her own and it‚Äôs one I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôve read. ",16,N/A
60093178,A Scatter of Light,lisa (lewis hamilton's version),130,408,3,"February 1, 2023","Many regards to Hodder & Stoughton and NetGalley for providing me this eARC in exchange for my honest review.Alexa, please play ""Illitcit Affairs"" by Taylor Swift.A Scatter of Light is a sapphic, coming-of-age story of Aria Tang West, half-Chinese half-White, set at the dawn of Obergefell v. Hodges. Aria, who was supposed to spend a summer with her friends in their villa, found herself being forced to spend her summer at her grandma's place in California. Here, she would embark on a quest of discovery and self-acceptance through a relationship with Joan West's gardener, Steph.Like Last Night at the Telegraph Club, this is a book about accepting self's queerness. Set in a very special context, Malinda Lo brings the readers on the journey to discover the colorful queer culture of 2015 California, where our protagonist, new to the vibrancy and the dynamics of queerness, learned to accept her identity. I also really like Malinda Lo's social commentary, although sometimes I feel like it could be more implicit. Moreover, the characters, namely Aria, Joan, Steph, were thoroughly developed: they felt pretty much like real people.As much as the good points go, I cannot give this book more than 3.5/5 because of THAT trope. Normally I wouldn't mind, because it would provide the angst, but in this case I didn't like it at all. Sure, maybe Lisa wasn't the best partner, but Aria's and Steph's apologetic cheating just itched me very badly. Like Steph could have broken up before idk.. The other element I wish the author had better developed was the grief. The tragic event happened way too late in the book, as a consequence, Aria's mourning wasn't as thoroughly shown as it should be in my opinion. Joan was a constant string in Aria's development as a person and as an artist, I wish Aria's mourning and reflection on this death was longer than 5 pages.. However, I think that the ending was highly tasteful for its openness, as it is not a love story with a happy ending.Overall, I recommend this book if you are open to some unpopular tropes, but I don't think fans of Last Night at the Telegraph Club will necessarily like this one. Nevertheless, A Scatter of Light stands on its own as a meaningful coming-of-age story set in a period where queer culture became legitimized in American society, and how a new adult came to terms with her queerness in this particular context.",14,N/A
60093178,A Scatter of Light,laurel [the suspected bibliophile],"1,327",350,4,"November 13, 2022","So, when my eyes read the phrase A companion novel to Last Night at the Telegraph Club, I though that there would be more of a glimpse into Lily and Kath's lives in the early 2010s...but it was really just a glimpse.Instead, this was a coming of age story of Lily's distant niece, Aria, who was exiled to her grandmother's house outside San Francisco after a really awful event right before graduation. There, Aria meets new friends, and realizes that she's not straight after all. It's both a coming out and coming of age and finding yourself without really and truly finding yourself story, if that makes sense.I loved the writing, but had both an easy time and a hard time with Aria's voice. She's so...disconnected emotionally from the events she's going through (highly relate) that's she's mostly just going through the motions. There's a lot of telling what she's doing, how she's feeling, and the disconnect doubles when you slowly realize that she's relating this summer through the lens of distance and time, adding another layer of disconnect to the dissociation. It was...an odd narrative choice to make, to have a first person POV that was so detached from everything around her, and yet it worked.There's a lot that happens in this book, and several trigger warnings: death of a close relative, cheating, nonconsensual taking and releasing of nude photography.I think what I wanted in the epilogue was something more concrete, something that showed Aria had connected with herself and bridged the gap between how she'd grown used to bottling everything up inside, tamping her emotions and feelings so far down that not even she felt them anymore. I think that maybe that was what the final art show was supposed to do, but I didn't make the connection.But this is a really good book. It felt real and raw in a way that I haven't felt in a while, reading YA contemporary books, and I think a lot of it is because how hard I related to Aria and her own disconnection to the world, because disassociation is a huge coping mechanism (not recommended, btw).",13,N/A
60093178,A Scatter of Light,Anya Smith,186,185,5,"October 9, 2022","Malinda Lo's previous novel, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is one of my favourite LGBTQ+ novels of all time, and A Scatter of Light is now up there beside it.A Scatter of Light is a tender exploration of sexuality, identity, art, and young love. Malinda Lo captures the raw messiness of teenage years and how nothing is ever simply black or white all within a few hundred pages. She deals with love and loss, happiness and heartbreak, but does so in such a captivating and well-rounded manner - I didn't feel as though the storyline was unfinished, which I often find with other standalone novels. I particularly enjoyed how she presented Steph's gender expression. One of my favourite aspects of the book was the connection between Aria and her Grandmother, Joan. For the last hundred pages, I was a sobbing wreck - Nina Lacour fans, you'd love this book...Her writing is captivating, so much so that I read this book in two sittings, not wanting to put it down. Overall a fantastic YA novel with LGBTQ+ (and Asian) representation. If that's your kind of book, definitely add this to your list.Thank you to the publisher and to Pride Book Tours for providing me with a copy to review.",12,N/A
