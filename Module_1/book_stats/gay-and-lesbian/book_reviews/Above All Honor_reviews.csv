I really do like the pull-push relationship between Cameron and Blair and how their relationship developed over time - though I must admit that there were times while reading the book where I’m appalled with Blair’s behaviour and perplexed how was it that Cam can remained ‘cool’ and unperturbed with Blair’s antics!,34,7
663722,Above All Honor,JulesGP,402,93,5,"February 5, 2021","After the real life attack on our US Capitol in January, quite a few us were ultra frightened for our incoming POTUS and VP. We hoped security would be tight enough and that the agents could be trusted to protect the new president and vice president. At the time, I kept hearing people commenting, if only Cam was around. Kamala Harris needs Cam Roberts right now and I wondered who is Cam? Thanks to my oft Reading Buddy, Tere, I soon found out. Cameron Roberts is a veteran secret service agent who is pulled out of Investigations to lead the security detail for the president’s daughter. Blair is 25, talented, and free spirited in every way. A tiger in a cage who Cam has to keep safe at all costs. Their intense chemistry leads them to break a few rules in a big way but it’s incredibly entertaining. Just good, solid storytelling with plenty of action, hot scenes, and classic style characters, a tough, handsome protector and the beautiful, young woman who falls hard for her. Cam and Blair are very addicting to follow and I’m glad there are plenty of Honor books left for me to read.",32,12

It's really The Best, on which all other novels have to graded against - is there a better pairing in all of literature than Blair & Cam? (...What about Emma & Jamie in Girls of the Summer? Stop!! That was rhetorical!!) Superb, love it and all those other extremes.",16,1 comment

663722,Above All Honor,Lo,197,54,4,"March 22, 2018","I really enjoyed this book, I was specifically looking for a lesbian fiction book which is how I discovered Radclyffe and I am glad I did. The book that captured me from the start and I struggled to put it down, great writing and a great story. The only reason that I haven't given it a 5 star rating is an echo of some of the previous comments on the cliché pairing of a closed off butch character falling for the femme character, the lesbian community is more diverse than this and not saying that it is not common but it has been done in novels and I would like to see a little more variety. Overall, great book and I would highly recommend. ",13,N/A
663722,Above All Honor,Bárbara Sousa,341,27,5,"September 7, 2020","This type of story is one of my favorites - an agent protecting someone important, in this case the daughter of the President of the United States. It reminds me of one of my favorite movies - The First Daughter with Katie Holmes but a wlw version and packed with more action.So it’s not a surprise that I LOVED this work of art!! Imma be honest, Cam and Blair had me pulling my hair throughout the book lol they were both just so stubborn and afraid of letting their guard down to love that they were always pushing one another away and doing stupid things to numb their pain and feelings. But at least in the end, they woke up and finally gave in to their desire and love.I just can’t help but love these kind of stories. And I’m so happy this book belongs to a series and there’s more books about this stubborn irresistible couple. I just hope nothing bad happens in the next books since the stalker is still out there and that just gives me anxiety lol but as long as they give me an happy ending in the end, I don’t mind suffering in the meantime. 100% recommend",7,2
663722,Above All Honor,Sandra,388,60,5,"February 23, 2022","This was one of my first books I've read in English. Now, many years later I listened to the audio version. And I still love it. Abby Craden did a great job too. Still one of my favorite Radclyffe books ",6,N/A
663722,Above All Honor,Megzz,153,109,2,"January 29, 2015","I have to be honest, I don't understand why this one has an average rating of more than 3. It's one of the most boring novels Radclyffe has written. There is such a lack of feelings in this book. Radclyffe describes what Cam and Blair feel for each other, but it's mainly lust and even that is not translated well in the characters' actions. As for romantic feelings, where do they come from? There is nothing intimate between the two, except for one personal conversation when Blair sketches Cam, but it still remains very superficial. There is also a lack of characterization: what really happened with Cam's lover? how does she really feel about her lover's death? was her lover the love of her life? We could also use some more details on how Blair struggles with her lack of freedom. It shows in her actions but there is still something missing in terms of EMOTIONS. I don't see them, anywhere. It's all words, and they don't work to make a believable and touching story.Blair and Cam are not even likable characters. Blair is an arrogant bitch throughout basically the whole book, and Cam is a boring robot. I'm also tired of the butch detective who's closed off and falls for the femme she is supposed to protect in lesbian romance novels. How about some originality? I read so many books of this genre and this plot sounded so familiar I had to read the summary of this one 5 times in order to remember I hadn't read it before. I won't read the rest of the series.",6,7
663722,Above All Honor,Justina Johnson,385,21,5,"August 28, 2015","This is the flat-out magnificent opening book for currently a nine volume series. The two main women are complex, intriguing, with tour-de-force presence, skills, and sensuality. I get to be shoulder to shoulder with the secret service team guarding the daughter and only child of the president of the United States. Additionally the new head of this team feels unceremoniously demoted after being placed on this assignment, as it is a bit of a radical shift from her previous posting and the track she appears to be on. Given that the protectee makes a habit of ditching and/or losing her designated team certainly makes this current position somewhat undesirable. Nevertheless it becomes rather obvious why it is given to the secret service agent in question. Oh my goodness, but these adversaries have no idea what is about to befall them. Smoothly spectacular!Cameron Roberts, often referred to as Cam, is a senior-level operative whose career has been on the investigative side of the secret service. Now she is moving into what is considered the protective side of the service. Anyhow, she quickly recognizes her previous qualifications are needed in spades to successfully manage this particular job and the astounding list of pitfalls and cleverly manipulated obstacle courses that must be overcome. Hovering over all the challenges in front of Cam is the fact that she recently lost her lover in addition to suffering a major leg injury. Nonetheless, Cam is nothing if not supremely proficient and could be on a direct track to an assistant director's position if she ever learned to play the internal politics game, which many in the know think is highly unlikely. It said a great deal to me that when the previous team is introduced to Cam, she more than impresses them all and her second in command breathed a sigh of relief when he clearly senses a whole new order of things were about to be put into action. From my point of view, Cam is a marvel. Splendidly sensational!Blair Allison Powell is the daughter of the president. Previously her father was the vice president of the United States and governor of New York. She has been in a fishbowl under constant observation from multiple quarters for years and has become a consummate escape artist losing her protection teams with a high degree of efficiency. She is also a professional artist whose talents are well known and respected. She is managed by a noted individual in the field and long-standing friend. Her sexual predilections are understood, but every attempt possible is made to keep that bit of data out of the press so as to be less problematical for her well known father. Blair does little to assist in the preferred cover-up, adding another dimension to the long list of complications she provides for the secret service. I adore Blair for her signature feistiness. Moreover, the deliciously rocky road resembling one of Blair's kick boxing competitions places the two main women in one of the most highly entertaining contentious competitions I have had the pleasure to read. Stunningly sublime!I unquestionably recommend everyone hop on this remarkable roller coaster ride. Surpassingly special!NOTE: This book was provided by Bold Strokes Books for the purpose of a review on Rainbow Book Reviews.",5,5
663722,Above All Honor,Jamie (TheRebelliousReader),"2,747",32,3,"March 23, 2022","3 stars. I liked the plot but the characters never did grow on me and I didn’t buy the romance at all. Blair is absolutely insufferable. I despised her character and how vapid, bratty, and shallow she was. There was no growth or depth. Blair felt like a robot. Just there and with no interesting characteristics. They spend 90% of the novel having sex with other people and then all of a sudden I’m supposed to believe in their love? Nope. I’ll probably continue on with the series only because I do really like Radclyffe’s writing but this first book just didn’t do it for me unfortunately. Three stars for the action packed plot and great writing.",4,N/A
663722,Above All Honor,Jay Odon,52,14,5,"October 15, 2012","Ok so this was my first outing with Radclyffe and I don't know why I haven't read her before. I think the name was throwing me off, kind of sounded like the books were written a long time ago but I was pleasantly surprised. I fell in love with this series in first couple of pages. The richness of the characters mixed with the ever surging storyline. Blair Powell is the presidents daughter and before that the vice president's and before that the governor's so she is used to being in the spotlight and having the Secret Service dogging her trail. She had her ways of ""escaping"" and eluding her followers and she didn't care much about it at all, and her protectors were sometimes unaware of where she was... Well that all stopped when Cameron Roberts entered the picture. Cam coming back from medical leave after a botched drug bust that left her shot and her lover dead. She passed all the doctors exams and was cleared for duty but instead of going back to her regular investigative position she is ""demoted"" to babysitter of the President's daughter. While she talked with the previous commander she was made aware of the hostile protectee and more so of her irregular schedule but Cam thought there was more to the story. When she first met with her team she laid down the law telling them to back off on the surveillance, give Blair some room to breath and make it easier on her so she will be more of an ally to her own protection rather than a hindrance. Cam's first meeting with Blair started off with ""Egret"" (the SS codename) was tenuous at best, answering the door ready to bolt, Cam keeps here there long enough to debrief her on the changes that have been made. During their meeting Blair tries her best to seduce the agent and while on the inside Cam felt the stirrings of attraction she pushed those away to concentrate on the business at hand. During the story there are highs and lows, revelations and realizations, love and hate, and lust and desire. The story unfolds at a perfect pace. Make sure you set aside some time to read because it is hard to put down. Love the way Radclyffe writes and look forward to being able to read more and more and for this we thank you!",4,N/A
663722,Above All Honor,Zoe,2,1 follower,3,"January 5, 2018","2,5 stars. I enjoyed this book, but not as much as I thought I would. The main characters were nice enough and the story was ok. Nothing we haven't read before, but who doesn't like a lesbian secret service agent ;). The whole 'romance' bit though... There was no real build up... Or maybe I should say, there was no romance at all. Cam and Blair only seemed interested in a sexual relationship for 90% of the book... So where do all the romantic feelings come from? I mean, I have no idea what or how it happened but suddenly they love each other? I think that's what bothered me the most, the only emotion the characters showed was lust ... And really, for a good romance we need a lot more than that.",4,1 comment
663722,Above All Honor,Pam Holzner,639,40,5,"July 15, 2019"," I quite like the first of Radclyffe's various series books. It's the usual butch and less butch (?). I'm writing this from memory but it seems like our other heroine is an artist and a wild child so femme is not quite the right adjective.Of course it's fun to read about other professions and what do I know about security for famous people? Zip. Radclyffe also does interesting things with bar scenes. Clearly these places are in a different city or on another planet from the places I've been (where people drank, danced and possibly made out -- no hot public sex that I can recall). Still, I love Cam's fierceness and determination. Who wouldn't love that in a fantasy partner?",4,N/A
