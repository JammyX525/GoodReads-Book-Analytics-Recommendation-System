48656848,Afterlove,theresa,276,4266,4,"July 20, 2021","Let‚Äôs just start this off by saying that the tagline ‚Äúthe lesbian love story you‚Äôve been dying to read‚Äù is not wrong. Far from it. I adored Afterlove from the very first page and only fell deeper as I was introduced to the love interest and romance and reapers. The strength of this book definitely lay in its romance. I fell hard for Ash and Poppy almost immediately and adored getting to read about their relationship throughout the first half of this book, from a not so cute meet cute to their first date to future plans. I think some readers may find their relationship to be a bit too insta love for their preference but I loved it. It felt natural for two teenagers, especially as we already know that Ash is a romantic who falls hard and fast. Ash and Poppy definitely fit the U-Haul lesbian stereotype and this made the book all the more heartbreaking as you watched them discussing and dreaming about the long life they would have together while knowing that it would be impossible, with tragedy looming on the horizon. I not only adored Poppy and Ash‚Äôs romance but them as individuals. Their personalities complimented each other so well, from Ash‚Äôs spunk to Poppy‚Äôs clever, sunshine demeanor. The separation of the book into two parts ‚Äì love and after ‚Äì was really effective as it allowed the readers time to fall in love with Poppy and Ash and their relationship, making Ash‚Äôs death and the resulting grief all the more heartbreaking. I also really enjoyed the lore surrounding the reapers and felt that Byrne did a really good job of explaining everything you needed to know about this world without overwhelming the reader. I won‚Äôt go into too much detail on the next point but I will say that the ending fits the book perfectly.My only criticism is that I‚Äôd have liked to see more of Ash‚Äôs grief for her family and best friend after her death. There is an initial moment of grief but it‚Äôs almost forgotten and considering how much time we spent with Ash‚Äôs family in the first part of the book, it felt a bit abrupt for them to barely cross Ash‚Äôs mind again.Afterlove is above all a love story. A story about the power of love and human connection and its ability to transcend all, even death. A story of two girls whose love only shines brighter for all the darkness it faces. I cannot recommend this book enough if you fancy a hint of paranormal tragedy in your romance or even a sapphic They Both Die at the End.I also talk about books here: youtube | instagram | twitter *Thank you BKMRK for an advanced copy.

48656848,Afterlove,tappkalina,627,381,2,"November 6, 2022","Not what I was expecting. I wanted something emotional and it gave me none.The prologue was the best part of it, it made me so excited, but the rest was boring. And it turned out the prologue is actually a full chapter in the book towards the middle/end, and while I loved it as a prologue, it did not fit in with the rest of the story. I felt like it was the first thing the author wrote and made it perfect, than copy-pasted it into her first draft, but not the writing style, nor the mc's emotions fit in well with the previous chapter.The end was alright, but the book itself lacked of emotions, and I failed to care about any of the characters.",51,N/A
48656848,Afterlove,Janna ,311,225,3,"September 13, 2021","The first part of the novel is about how Ash and Poppy get to know each other and fall in love. We learn about her best friend and her little sister and their lives as brown girls living in Brighton.That was the part I enjoyed the most - and even though I was looking forward to the paranormal theme of this book so much originally - that was the part that disappointed me the most. To me it felt like Ash had next to no agency after she died. Yes, she wants to see Poppy again, but that's it.I wish there would have been more to her character than that. I get that that's the main plot line, but there needs to be a little bit more to a character than a wish to see their romantic love interest for them to have some kind of depth.One last thing that I was really disappointed with was a transphobic comment made by Poppy which was left uncriticized.When Ash tells Poppy she's a lesbian, she responds ""Same. I'm strictly clitly"". It's ""just"" a sentence, but it has a big meaning. There are women who don't have vaginas - and to exclude them from your definition of being a lesbian is and will always be transphobic.It's really devastating to read these ""small"" but harmful comments made repeatedly in the books I read. I bet most authors don't even realise what they're writing is transphobic.. which might be one big problem itself: lack of education.But it's not the task of trans people to educate every single author on this planet. Honestly, if you can do your research on myths or the 17th century or whatever - you can spend a minute to educate yourself about transphobia and how to avoid including it in your writing.To conclude, I enjoyed the writing style, the setting and found the idea of the plot intriguing - the execution only to some degree, unfortunately.content warnings: death, racism, queerphobia, harry potter reference, transphobia, knife attack, car accident",50,4

Rep: British Indo-Guyanese lesbian mc, lesbian li, Turkish side character, British Indian side character, hijabi side character, Indo-Guyanese side charactersCWs: death, mentions of suicides & overdosesGalley provided by publisherAfterlove is a gorgeously-written paranormal(ish) romance(is) YA novel. I say ‚Äúish‚Äù because it‚Äôs sort of both of these things but also not. It blends aspects of each very successfully to come up with something wholly in its own class.In the book, we follow Ash as she meets and falls in love with Poppy. But then the unthinkable happens and Ash wakes up, neither quite dead nor quite alive, but in between. A reaper, tasked with escorting the souls of the dead to the afterlife.The first thing I noticed about this book was how brilliant the writing was. It‚Äôs that kind of writing that can rip you apart with only a few words, so obviously I was predisposed to love it. And that writing made it very easy just to slip into the story and wait for it to break my heart.Which it duly did! Not quite as early on as I thought, admittedly, though I guess it‚Äôs a hard one to balance. You want to have your readers believe in the relationship between Ash and Poppy, which means you need to develop it. But the crux of the story is in Ash‚Äôs death and her subsequent desire to see Poppy again one last time.It made the pacing a little odd, to be honest. It felt like it was going pretty slowly up until Ash‚Äôs death, but at the same time Ash and Poppy‚Äôs relationship was developing very rapidly. The contrast between the two is what made the pacing seem strange to me. Maybe though, I was more atuned to that because I was expecting the book to almost open with Ash‚Äôs death, and not for it to be the halfway mark or so. (Also at one point, I was surprised that the book had only progressed by two weeks, when it felt like a lot longer. But I think, like I said, the pacing was a product of the story.)But that didn‚Äôt affect my liking of the story so much, thankfully. I was still fully invested throughout and desperately hoping that the foretold ending would actually somehow be subverted.And I maybe sort of teared up a bit at the end.(Seriously, can we get like a short story sequel thing? I just wanna know how they‚Äôre doing!)",42,N/A

She needs to deal with grief, she needs to deal with the loss of her one and only love and the loss of her own life, she died at sixteen, she had all of her life ahead and she lost it.But when she loses, she learns how life is small and you need to be you, without fear and without strings attached. a little late? maybe.The book's message about loving, being loved, and living a full life is one of the purest and most well-written things i‚Äôve ever read.""I am not to be loved. Not out loud anyway‚ÄùAnd then, the love story, i don‚Äôt have words, Poppy was ash‚Äôs first love, the person who really saw Ash and want to know her in every way possible, poppy love her out loud. Not even death separated them. ‚Äù When I say that I love you, Ash, I don‚Äôt meant that I love in the way that I love Basquiat or oat milk lattes, I mean that I love you. All that you are and all that you will be and I can‚Äôt wait to find out who that person is.‚ÄùAsh and Poppy are made for each other. They made me happy and break my heart, an emotional ride. Not even death can tear them apart, like really. ‚ÄùWe‚Äôve found each other again. Of all the people, her.THE WRITTEN!!!!! I never really pay attention to writing (only if it's really bad cough cough) but omg the author knows how to write, knows how to touch you and make you cry!!! knows how to show what the characters are feeling in the best possible way. it's poetical, even the monologues!!!! they are not boring!!!
  ‚ÄùYou found each other in life and you found each other in death and you‚Äôll find each other in whatever‚Äôs beyond the sea.‚Äù

48656848,Afterlove,L T,16,8,2,"July 20, 2021","Like? The first half of the book had me hooked and I was straight (not really) up sobbing with some of the passages about Ash and Poppy‚Äôs relationship. It was twee, adorable‚Äî and then the grim reaper plot just kind of. Happened. That‚Äôs the only way I can describe how it unfolded. It just happened.All of a sudden, this quirky adorable romance becomes a rushed attempt at exploring our relationship with, well, life and it‚Äôs fragility. Here one minute, could be gone the next‚Äî all very They Both Die At The End but make it British Lesbians. However, the story is just a bit blunt. In need of a big polish, more plot development‚Äî the holes in this one are big enough to drive a whole truck through, like seriously what is the system of grim reapers? Are they all girls? What is with the ‚Äòoh we didn‚Äôt tell you at the start but after a year you can leave!‚Äô shoehorned in to round up some hurried ending? I‚Äôll talk about the ending more but if you‚Äôre going to play around with a semblance of a paranormal system in your book, I personally prefer it when it‚Äôs a bit more thought through with some solid concepts and a bit more‚Äî sadly, unique.I mean, when I originally saw this I was like ‚Äòoh dope a lesbian romance Dead Like Me! perfect!‚Äô But I didn‚Äôt realise that most of the nuances of the reapers are just taken directly from my favourite Bryan Fuller series‚Ä¶ Like, the ‚Äòtransition‚Äô the reapers go through so people don‚Äôt recognise them in public? Literally almost exactly the same. Oh, the reapers get their deaths on a little post-it with the name? Yep. And all of the reapers are quirky (which I did love) and say the darnedest twee bits like ‚Äòoh! I‚Äôm from the kiddie cancer department!‚Äô with no holding back to drive home on just quirky they are? You guessed it. They even throw a party in a dead persons house, like how the reapers in dead like me sleep in dead people‚Äôs apartments, etc. It‚Äôs just frustrating especially when the show is such a little hidden gem. This could be a total coincidence but like, it annoys me so I have to mention it in case anyone else likes this show and is intrigued by this book for the same reason.The actual characters themselves, too? Eh. I loved Ash, loved her family, and her relationship with Poppy. Loved Poppy, loved her relationship with the world and how they spoke with one another. It felt very real, all the dialogue was fun and reminds me of how I spoke at 16. Super tasty and validating for that reason. But, the reapers? Forgettable. I got most of them mixed up with one another. Also, in the second half of the book Poppy became an absolute manic pixie dream girl (they can exist in wlw books, and they DO), and all her dialogue became so insufferable. I really struggled with the mini golf scene so bad.I think all my investment in these characters completely dissipated by the time the book winded down. When the actual ending happened I didn‚Äôt cry, despite the author‚Äôs best attempts to make that a thing. It was written like a tear jerker, but kept constantly backtracking it‚Äôs messages and metaphors to a point where I got exhausted reading it. Ash makes a point for two pages on how important it is to tell people we love them, enjoy our interests and take risks! But then refuses to go for a night swim with Poppy because she‚Äôs scared (I know she was scared FOR Poppy, but it didn‚Äôt read this way until the author literally wrote that in). Representation is important, especially with the lesbophobic culture of booktok/booktube often reading white cis mlm books but actively refusing to read wlw, too. AND, not all representation has to be the greatest book on earth to earn its spot ‚ú® on the grand high council of lgbt+ books. I would actively recommend this to readers perhaps a little younger (and less jaded). It‚Äôs good representation, has a diverse cast of characters and explores messages and culture in a mostly appropriate manner (despite the crass kiddie cancer thing). It‚Äôs not a /bad/ book. It‚Äôs not a great book, either. It sits on the middle. It either should have been another 500 pages, to properly invest us in the reapers, adequately show us their system-thing, and come up with an ending that doesn‚Äôt feel horribly cliche. Or, it should have been about 300, and axed that fucking golf scene as well as every time Ash has the exact same conversation over and over with the reapers AND every time Poppy drinks an oat milk latte. We get it, she‚Äôs vegan and gay‚Äî we all drink oat milk lattes but like drink some water for a change. Overall, I think two stars for a personal vibe on the book is fair. It‚Äôs just not for me. It‚Äôs a tad repetitive. If you like to switch your brain off and have a nice, wholesome romance (which is nice to see for a wlw teen book!) yeah go for it, you‚Äôll probably enjoy it. I definitely would appreciate this book more if I read it after something quite heavy. But, I am cynical and need my girl gang grim reapers with a bit of spice and grit instead of the industry plant disney original ‚Äòpunk‚Äô aesthetic than they were sporting in here. It deserves a lot of love and I‚Äôm sad I couldn‚Äôt give it more despite having had this book on pre-order since the start of May. Definitely, give it a try and support the author! We need more diverse wlw stories, where the homophobia isn‚Äôt the main aspect of the story‚Äî and this is how we make that happen. So, if u don‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm going to rewatch dead like me, swap out my milk alternatives and hastily pass on this book to someone who is going to appreciate it.",21,3

48656848,Afterlove,MZ,400,96,4,"October 5, 2021","3.5 stars. Cute and bittersweet. I had no idea what to expect from this book and even without expectations I still had the feeling that this was not what I expected. The YA and paranormal aspects drew me in, but it was heavier than I thought, which, unfortunately, did take away some of my enjoyment of the book even though I thought it was written very well.This book starts (well, after the first chapter, which is set in the future) with the cutest YA romance. Ash is a 16-yo teenager with indo-Guyana roots living in Brighton with her parents and younger sister that she adores. Ash just wants to fall in love, to be loved, and not to be used as an experiment and all her dreams come true when she finally meets Poppy. They are so cute together, and it was so good to read, but then there was this nagging thought in the back of my head‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Ash is going to die. Because that‚Äôs what the book‚Äôs about. Ash dies and becomes a reaper of the dead, but she can‚Äôt forget about Poppy. So, there is this incredibly sweet start of their romance until it abruptly comes to an end and this signals the second part of the book. The tone of the narration changes, it‚Äôs angry, sad and lonely and yes there are also some good moments in this second half of the book, but the best way I can describe the feeling is bittersweet. When I read the acknowledgments I understood it better, I knew where the feeling that I got was coming from, as the author describes the loss of a loved one that left her grieving and lonely and unable to write for a very long time. She explains that life divides itself in a before and after period, which is how the book is divided as well. Afterlove is written in first person from the POV of Ash and this strengthened the emotions in this book even further, as you‚Äôre constantly in Ash‚Äôs headspace, which is not always the easiest place to be. But it‚Äôs not all gloom and doom, as Ash settles into her reaper life she discovers things about herself and about life in general and the book ends on a lighter note. Based on the writing I would rate this book higher, but as I mentioned, this was hard to read at times and left me feeling unsettled. It‚Äôs a book I will remember though and it kept me curious until the end, so I have mixed feelings about it. I don‚Äôt think it will be for everybody, but it‚Äôs a good book if you don‚Äôt mind the theme and accompanying emotions.",17,10
