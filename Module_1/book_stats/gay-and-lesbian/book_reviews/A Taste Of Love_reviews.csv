50018777,A Taste Of Love,Gaby LezReviewBooks,710,326,5,"August 3, 2019","Natalie Hill works at her aunt’s gin distillery based in the Cotswolds and is convinced she’ll remain single forever. That is until newly-arrived city-slicker Ellie Knap opens an ice-cream parlour in front of Natalie’s shop. Ellie is hard to resist with her tall, dark good looks and her exquisite ice creams flavours, but Natalie fears that Ellie’s stay in the Cotswolds won’t be permanent. Will they have a happily ever after?This is book 2 of ‘The Village Romance’ series of three romance novels by T.B. Markinson, Clare Lydon and Harper Bliss set around a small town in the Cotswolds, England. Even though the main characters in each novel make an appearance in the others, each story is completely independent of the other two and can be read as standalone. Having said that, ‘A taste of love’ reveals a bit of TB Markinson’s ‘A shot at love’, so I recommend to read that one first. As a matter of fact, I recommend reading the three books because they are all equally enjoyable.‘A taste of love’ presents three of my favourite things in life: love, gin and ice cream! Let me warn you that it’s hard to avoid temptation with so many references of ice cream flavours, some classic and others very innovative. The gin tasting scene had my mouth watering and the romance is classic Clare Lydon: funny, witty and hot.This novel goes beyond the romance to also depict family relationships and life in a small community. I particularly enjoyed the secondary plot that highlights the relationship between Natalie and her father in which the author throws an unexpected twist. All secondary characters are well written and make the small town come alive in front of the readers’ eyes. As usual, Ms. Lydon delivers an authentically English, banter-filled, hot romance.Overall, an entertaining, flavoursome and love-filled city country girl romance book. 4.5 stars.ARC provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.See all my reviews at www.lezreviewbooks.com",12,2

50018777,A Taste Of Love,Les Rêveur,461,121,4,"August 2, 2019","Natalie is the village sweetheart. Everyone loves her; the only problem is she can’t find a love life. She has all but given up on love when Ellie crashes into her… literally! Ellie is from London originally, but she is ready for a quiet life in the Cotswolds with her newly opened Ice Cream parlour. Neither woman are looking for love, but love finds them, and with the usual wacky family members and village locals you are in for a wild ride!Fantastic book! Once I started it, I couldn’t put it down and the late night/early morning finish was a testament to what a beautiful story it was. I especially loved the secondary character in this book, especially Natalie’s Dad. He won my heart in a big way. That all being said I would have loved an epilogue for these two awesome ladies. Natalie and Ellie have chemistry in spades! The attraction was evident from very early on, and when they do finally get to the first kiss, it was explosive. The sexual tension and built up was spectacular. I love how the author cultivated their passion for each other.Excellent novel and this new series is shaping up well. I can’t wait to start Harper Bliss’s book three in the Village Romance Series.Star Rating: 4.5 Stars",5,N/A
50018777,A Taste Of Love,Allison,117,3,4,"July 25, 2019","I found the second in the Village Romance series much more enjoyable. My issue of the first was in in your face stereotypes of tourists about every other page. While this story had them as well, it wasn’t as predominant or annoying. Remember folks, as annoying as those tourists are, they are what keeps you in business. I live in a town that once a year is inundated with tourists from all over the world for 10 days, I get the madness. The two main characters in this story were both very sweet and strong, working and building successful businesses and lives of their own. Both have been burned in the past, but as much as they both don’t want to admit it haven’t closed themselves off completely to love. A tiny bit of angst where I think Natalie jumped to conclusions a little too quickly. All in all a very enjoyable read and I honestly wouldn’t mind living in a village like this. I think the village is a character itself. Yes, everyone knows about everything that is going on in everyone’s lives, but they also have each other’s backs. The community comes together and supports each other. I’m looking forward to hearing about more.",5,N/A

50018777,A Taste Of Love,Carol Hutchinson,734,60,5,"August 7, 2019","Absolutely loved this!!! Natalie Hill, the village sweetheart hasn’t given up on love, but it hasn’t been easy for her. When Ellie, another Londoner arrives in Upper Chewford, Natalie is worried she might be another fleeting city escapee, but when she gets to know Ellie, and her dreams to sell ice cream to the villagers, she gets more than she bargained for. I couldn’t get enough of this story, or the characters, or this series, and certainly of the Gin, and Ice Cream!!! It was really addictive. The story was sweet, romantic, a pinch of humour, and yet refreshingly exciting and inventive. Clare brings her unique style to this collaboration series, with her humour, and loveable characters that inject nothing but charm into the story. Of course no romance would be complete without drama, and conflict, which Clare brings in healthy servings throughout the story to keep the reader on their toes, let alone the poor characters – village life certainly isn’t sleepy! I laughed so much reading this, and had the biggest smile on my face because it was cute, funny, and like spending time with an old friend. I couldn’t put it down and really got invested in Natalie and Ellie’s lives, as if I was right there in the village ready to give my opinion like all the other villagers. I could totally connect to the storyline, the characters, and their feelings, just everything. It was just perfect! (Like mint choc chip ice cream – sorry Clare!) I really need more from Natalie and Ellie, I haven’t had enough of them, and I still have some gin left, which is only appropriate to drink with them!I can’t chose a favourite character out of Ellie and Natalie because they were so unique, and I really could identify with what they were both going through. Their chemistry was amazing, instant attraction, but self-denial and holding back makes it the ultimate slow burn romance, with heaps of amazing tension. When they are together they are cute, and sexy – fitting a few stereotypes but I wouldn’t have them any other way. Loved them so much, and really, really hope I see more from them in future. Special shoutout to Natalie’s dad though – when you read the book you will know why!!!A total cuteness overload, sweet, and totally a loveable book. Really can’t recommend it, and this series enough – it’s just good for the soul, and a total mood booster. ",4,N/A

50018777,A Taste Of Love,Kristin Charles,67,1 follower,5,"July 27, 2019",I really enjoyed this book. Just be prepared you will really want some ice cream while reading this. The 2 main characters are great together. I love how the town itself seems to take on a character role. Each book in the series can be read as a stand-alone. There are a few mentions of Jess and Harry from the 1st book. I look forward to reading the 3rd in this series soon. ,3,N/A
50018777,A Taste Of Love,Alex,328,17,4,"August 10, 2019","I liked the way the MCs became acquainted with each other, those clumsy moments felt out of a romantic comedy movie, and I’m a sucker for those. The secondary characters made it a better book, they were funny and necessary. I wasn’t so keen about the ex girlfriend and the misconceptions but I understand some drama was necessary and given the plot that was the way to go.",3,N/A

50018777,A Taste Of Love,Karen,563,14,4,"July 29, 2019","A Taste of Love is the second romance in The Village Romance series with the first one written by T.B Markinson and the 3 being written by Harper Bliss. I would first say that this could be read as a standalone, but I recommend you reading #1 first just because it's a good book. The MCs in this one is Natalie and Ellie. Both have had a rough go at romance in the past with Natalie always falling for the Londoner who can't commit to country living and Ellie the Londoner who has fled city living for Country living after heartbreak.These two MCs are just so cute together. I have to admit that I liked that Ellie was a good bit taller than Natalie (not that that really matters). Even though they have a rocky start, there is chemistry between them. I really enjoyed the story line. My one complaint is that the angst in this one was a bit overblown. Despite that I did enjoy the supporting characters and the secondary story about Natalie's dad. Whenever I pick up a Lydon romance, I know that I am going to enjoy it. I will rate this one 4 stars.",2,N/A
50018777,A Taste Of Love,Megan,272,7,3,"May 18, 2020","2.5 Stars. Natalie Hill is not looking for love in her small town. That was until she met Ellie Knap, who is from London. She first meets Ellie has Ellie accidentally makes Natalie falls into the river when Ellie bike rides over a small, narrow bridge. Ellie and Natalie cannot stay away from each other. Ellie is opening an ice cream shop next to Ellie's gin store. Natalie is helping Ellie open her shop and get accustomed to the town and Ellie wants to help Natalie with her festival she is planning for the town. They cannot deny their attraction bur Natalie has had been hurt by a city girl before. Natalie cannot help but be a little cautious. I enjoyed this book, it was easy to read. I did not particularly love it, I thought it was average for the most part. It was not bad and it was an enjoyable read. I liked the dynamic between Ellie and Natalie but I was a little frustrated by Their relationship at times and their misunderstandings leading to fights. I would recommend this book if you enjoy Claire Lydon, as it seemed average for her. ",1 like,N/A

I loved the story line, the characters of Ellie and Natalie were sweethearts all the way through the book. The secondary characters were also a great bunch. The pace was just right. I would definitely recommend reading this. It can be read as a standalone but to get the full experience of all characters etc I would start with book 1.",1 like,N/A

Lydon's writing is fresher and more authentic. There's the seemingly inevitable manufactured conflict, but thankfully it's short-lived.",1 like,N/A

I really enjoyed this lighthearted romp through Upper Chewford.So it’s hats off to T.B Markinson, Clare Lydon and Harper Bliss for coming up with this concept, it’s a winner.",1 like,N/A
