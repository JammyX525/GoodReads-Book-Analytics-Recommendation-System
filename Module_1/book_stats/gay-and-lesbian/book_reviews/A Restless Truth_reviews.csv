59807966,A Restless Truth,Jane (whatjanereads),496,87,4,"November 8, 2022","Actual rating: 4-4,5So, A marvellous light has been one of my top 10 books of last year. Instant 5 star read, already read it twice and absolutely loved it.A mix of historical fiction / queer romance / magical murder mystery was the combination I didnâ€™t know I needed, but 100% did.Edwin is my son and needs to be protected at all costs. And my sweet himbo Robin, heâ€™s like a labrador, you canâ€™t not love him.So I was extremely sad when I saw that this next book wouldnâ€™t be following them. I loved these idiots so much!!!(No, not because I hate lesbians Hannah. ðŸ™„)Switching MCs in the middle of an ongoing story is always a risky business.But I need not have feared, because this book was amazing!I was hoping a little that this book would be following Miss Morrissy, because she was a fierce queen in book 1 and I fell head over heels in love with her.But Maud was a great protagonist too and it made a lot of sense to pick her for the next part of the story!After finding (and loosing) the first part of the contract, our little group of misfits is set out to find the other parts to keep them away from the bad guys.Maud wants to help too, since Robin did so much for her. So she heads to America to find one of the other woman involved. But sheâ€™s not the only one looking for herâ€¦This whole books takes place on the ship back to England, including magical combat, a whole zoo, hot bisexual singers and not only one murder. Oh, thereâ€™s also our beloved dickhead Hawthorn, who I somehow came to like?! I loved Maud, she was very stubborn and stood up for herself against anyone and anything! She was a great protagonist and always up for a surprise.I also loved Violet, the amount of independent, strong willed woman in this series is everything we need from historical fiction.I also loved the side characters, especially Ross. He made this book the most fun and I am crossing my fingers the next book will be about him!The only thing I have to criticise about this book: a whole book taking place in one single setting simply isnâ€™t too gripping for me. It takes place over only three days, but it somehow felt much longer to me. I would have wished to see a little of Maud in America!A little addition: Both narrators of these books are incredible, theyâ€™re doing a brilliant job! I can absolutely recommend reading this series via audio!",108,12
59807966,A Restless Truth,Lex Kent,"1,682",8528,3,"December 7, 2022","3.00 Stars. Have you ever wanted to like a book, even after reading, a lot more than you actually did? This is how I felt about this book. I was really excited about this. I enjoy historic-fantasy books, but I donâ€™t get to read them enough. I thought if this might be like The Ruthless Lady's Guide to Wizardry or The Lady's Guide to Celestial Mechanics, then I would be a happy reader. I had not read the first book in this series, so I knew it might be an issue, but I had heard that the main characters from book one was not even in this book, and that this was a mystery that took place on a ship, so it seemed like its own contained story. While I do feel like I missed out on a few things, like not learning enough about the magic system, not reading the first book was not the reason why I didnâ€™t love this like I hoped. This real reason, the reason why I just canâ€™t rate this over 3 stars when I normally have a great track record with Tor books, unfortunately is that the book was just too long, and I was honestly bored at times.Iâ€™m late in doing this review. If you follow my reviews, Iâ€™ve mentioned this but everyone around me, including my household, got Covid but me. I had to take care of everyone without catching it, and I was exhausted and not getting a lot of sleep. At night I kept picking this book up and I would get through a few pages but not enough happened to keep my interest over sleep. We all know when a good book makes us chose it over precious sleep and that was not happening here. As Covid started to lift for everyone, I was lucky enough to get the flu. Again, I tried and tried to read this book and I just could not do it and I turned to some audiobooks and some other books that were keeping my attention. Now healthy, I finally powered through this book in the last two days, and it was tough. My Kindle edition says only 400 pages but Iâ€™m finding it hard to believe. I guess it is all about the pace. There was 40% of this book that was well done and fun, interesting with even good steamy scenes, but the other 60% was like pulling hair to be honest. In the end I canâ€™t recommend this one, but I wonâ€™t say stay away either and here is why. For one, I read a good chunk of this while sick or exhausted so I canâ€™t be the best judge because of that. And number two, because I did not read the first book, I could be missing out on parts that make this book shine better as part of a pair. So, while I can only give this an okay grade, this may work better for someone who wanted to read this because they loved the first book.A copy was given to me for an honest review.",59,12
59807966,A Restless Truth,urwa,256,98,1,"November 9, 2022","1 starThe only thing I liked about this book was that it ended. Which was shocking considering how much I loved book 1. The magic system introduced in A Marvellous Light was so fresh and unique, with an emphasis on consent and the magic of liminal spaces. Whereas in A Restless Truth there was barely any discussion of magic, the little there was felt like reading a boring textbook (and i love boring textbooks!). I was excited to learn about the Forsythia Club which seemed like a super mysterious and interesting group of magical women, but it just ended up being a bunch of boring old women with flimsy motives. I really could not understand what the point of them was?? They were introduced to be such menacing women in book 1. My harsh rating is also due to the fact that this had such missed potential and turned out to be a bloody disappointment.The evil villains were dumb as fuck and it made no sense how they were thwarted by an even stupider set of heroes. Like seriously every singlr character was so dumb and literally did not do anything interesting the entire book. The book was pitched as ""Knives Out on a ship"", but there was barely any suspense or intrigue because there was no sense of danger with the stakes being so low. One would have hoped that the writing of the first book would be this one's saving grace but nope, it was lame as hell. I found myself bored to bits, the only reason I finished this was because I still have hope for the last book.And then there were the main characters and their romance. Oh boy, buckle in because I have some strong opinions! I am so sick and tired of mediocre sapphic romances being succeeded by blockbusting wonderful mlm romances. There is an inherent prejudice among the publishing the reading community against sapphic books, where readers on general prefer mlm books over wlw books. Toxic and infuriating as that is, what angers me, even more, is when that SAME author who wrote such an amazing book 1 involving an mlm couple managed to write the most boring and cringe-inducing sapphic romance. I swear to you both characters were the most tropiest tropes to ever walk this tropey earth. We have our typical slutty bisexual who is confident and flirty and femme as hell because that is all there is to bi women. Then we have our protagonist who is the naive femme lesbian who is 20 years old but has never heard the word ""fuck"", and she is introduced to the rainbow world of gayness by the pushy femme. That is the EPITOME of cliche sapphic romances and I am SO MAD because this could have been so much more! The chemistry is a dud, because the attraction is entirely physical (for fuck's sake they've known each other for only 3 days!!), which means that the sex scenes come off as bland and forced. I so missed the tender and emotional moments that Robin and Edwin had in book 1 which made their chemistry burst off the pages. Nuance of any kind or form was entirely absent in this book.",43,7
59807966,A Restless Truth,Colleen is on Semi Hiatus (Health Issues),372,127,4,"January 2, 2023","A Restless Truth is the fun, entertaining historical fiction/fantasy and quite spicy second book in the The Last Binding Triology.Maud is aboard a ship traveling back home to London from America. She was sent on a dangerous mission to help her brother Robin secure the second magical piece of The Contract. If The Contract falls into the wrong hands every magicianâ€™s power and way of life will be in danger. Maudâ€™s relieved knowing sheâ€™s on her way back home and believes the danger has passed. Until she finds a dead body and Maud realizes she is in more danger than ever. Stuck on a boat for seven days with someone (or possibly someoneâ€™s) obviously hunting her down and for the other piece of The Contract. Maud teams up with with an unlikely stranger, Ms. Violet Debanham. Violet who is no stranger to the world of magic is running from her own secrets. But she canâ€™t help but to assist Maud in tracking down the magical item and trying to keep it out of the wrong hands. Maud (who is quite innocent) and Violet (who is definitely NOT innocent) start a sort of flirtatious back and forth like tango all the while trying to dodge the bad guys. As the danger heats up so do their feelings. But will they be able to survive the remainder of the trip let alone figure out their feelings once the R.M.S. Lyric docks in England?I was a bit disappointed to find the second book was not a continuation of Robin and Edwardâ€™s story but in fact about Maud, Robinâ€™s younger sister, who was a side character in the first book. But once again the world of magical mayhem Freya Marske has created sucked me in and I actually enjoyed getting to know these new (some anyways) cast of characters. Maud and Violet working together to uncover the bad guys and try and save the day was so much fun. And definitely HOT ðŸ”¥ at times! But the side characters were just as important and added the perfect touch to this fast paced magical mystery. I especially liked Lord Hawthorn and Ross and they ended up being the perfect antiheroâ€™s and almost upstaged the ladies as my favorite characters. If you like your romance on the spicy side you will appreciate Maud and Violetâ€™s very descriptive affair. I loved their ability to be uninhabited but I found myself blushing hard on more than one occasion. Freya Marske has a way with words. Her writing is immersive and perfect for this period piece. She brought the world of the early 1900â€™s mixed with murder and magic alive in vivid detail in my mindâ€™s eye. I do have one complaint. I think the story was a little too long or maybe needed a location change instead of taking place all aboard a ship. Otherwise A Restless Truth was a sensational second book in The Last Binding Trilogy. I am excited and a bit sad to see the last book. Excited because now I have no idea if more new characters will be introduced or if Edward and Robin will team up with Maud and Violet. Sad because this captivating adventure will soon be coming to an end. Thank You Tor/Forge book for the gifted ALC in exchange for my honest review.",42,15
59807966,A Restless Truth,Marieke (mariekes_mesmerizing_books),424,236,4,"September 26, 2022","Actual rating 3.5 stars.I loved this story, and at the same time, it didnâ€™t meet up to my expectations for a very stupid reason. A very me-thing, so donâ€™t let me discourage you from reading this story! Let me take you back to last year.A Marvellous Light was my first audiobook ever, and it was also my last. I might pick up one in the future again, but I found out that only listening to a book wasnâ€™t my cup of tea. Therefore I decided to alternate between the audio and the ebook. I hated the speed (yes, I adjusted it several times) and that I couldnâ€™t simply leaf back. What I loved, though, was this posh voice narrating the audiobook, and while I was reading the ebook, I heard this voice in the back of my head. It gave such a beautiful extra layer to the story. And while reading A Restless Truth, I missed the narrator's voice in the back of my head. I know, very stupid reason. I still liked the story and recommend it to anyone who loved the first book in this trilogy, and itâ€™s perfectly readable as a stand-alone. Again, Freya Marlaâ€™s writing is descriptive, vivid, and humorous, filled with magic and a mystery in between. I already liked Maud in A Marvellous Light, and I became her fan even more in this book. She and Violet (I adored Violet, she made me smile so much!) made up for missing Robin and Edwin because I had hoped to meet them a bit more. I read somewhere that they will be back in the last book of this series, and Iâ€™m really looking forward to that story! I received an ARC from Pan Macmillan en NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.",36,2
59807966,A Restless Truth,Charlotte (Romansdegare),78,53,5,"November 1, 2022","I am going to keep this review as spoiler-free as humanly possible, because truly one of the best things about A Restless Truth was how it unfolded an absolutely edge-of-your-seat plot that had me alternately gasping and holding my breath through entire chapters. But if you don't like *anything* at all spoiled, here's my short take: A Restless Truth maintains the gorgeous prose and deft character work of A Marvellous Light, while extending its overarching mystery and deepening the world-building of the magic system, all while creating something entirely new for Maud and Violet that felt like it was their own, and not just a shadow of the first book. It's a story that has something for nearly everyone (hijinks, mystery, romance, sex, feelings, banter, humor, atmosphere, prose for DAYS), yet manages to pull together a coherent whole. This will easily make my top books of 2022. Ok. Full review. No major spoilers for plot, some information about tone, feelings, romantic arc, etc. I do think it's worth saying a word about my expectations coming into this book, because expectations can be a funny thing. As is clear from my review and blog post, I loved A Marvellous Light a whole lot. But when I started hearing things about the second book - essentially that it was a low-angst hijinks-y ""Knives Out On A Boat"" romp - I will admit I had my hackles up. Because while I firmly believe that books within a series can and should switch up tone and heat level as appropriate for the story, and without wanting to ascribe value to certain tones/heat levels over others... I did have feelings about having to haul around another stone for our cultural edifice of angsty, sexy, tortured mlm vs. cute, emotionally-defanged, gals-being-pals wlw. And honestly, this book smashed my expectations with a one-two punch. Because not only were the rompy, Knives Out elements of this book SO well-executed that I'd essentially made up my mind around 30% in that I would be fine with nothing but those, but then Freya Marske also brought the heat, a dash of emotional angst, and what I can only describe as some grown-ass feelings and internal conflict. And proceeded to balance them throughout the rest of the book in a manner I can only liken, rather tritely given the subject matter, to magic. Our two heroines here are Violet and Maud. Maud is Robin's sister, whom we met in book one, where quite frankly she didn't do much for me. Things started out slowly for her here with me as well, but she grew into a fascinating character. Her primary external motivations are a quest for a [redacted object], and to prove her worth and helpfulness to her beloved older brother. Internally, she reacts to having been raised by horrible manipulative parents with a stubborn adherence to never telling a lie. Her arc is, on further consideration, a knightly one - a quest for a holy object, a devotion to brotherhood, a strict moral adherence to truth. Which is a theme I will confess I might have picked up on right away if she was a 40-year-old man on a horse, but ""knight's honor"" is something I wasn't ready to see immediately in an unsure 20-year-old girl. It was fascinating to read exactly how that characterization sat on her shoulders, to watch how she herself, and others around her (and I) read her morals as naivetÃ© and her quest as frivolous meddling until we got to know her better. I love when a book has the guts to present a character as one thing, and lets them grow into something else, building on an understanding of human tendencies to make judgements and willingness to learn. And opposite her, we have Violet Debenham, for whom I immediately was and remain ready to die. She's a young woman who escaped her English family to be an actress in New York City, who wields the art of illusion both as an acting job and a magical skill. Set up against Maud's stubborn devotion to the truth, Violet understands the power of artifice, especially for a woman in a patriarchal society. This is, in a lot of ways, my thematic catnip: explorations of people who fight back against societal perceptions of their ""flaws"" by turning those flaws into weapons. Violet is the more experienced of the two women - in terms of magic, life experience, and knowledge of sex. But she has a kind of softness underneath her shell that contrasts beautifully with the steely core inside Maud's apparent innocence, which bring the two women into very believable and often fiery contact and conflict. The rest of what I have to say is going to remain a bit impressionistic, since I don't want to spoil the fun. There's a great cast of characters here, whose antics are kept grounded by the bone-dry sarcasm of a very put-upon Lord Hawthorn, who is going to absolutely kill it as the hero of the next book (I'm assuming. He almost has to be). There's a LOT going on plot-wise, but the author balances it all so well: within the first couple chapters, I had met a dozen new characters who I had no trouble keeping straight, and had an entire ocean liner mapped out so clearly I could follow all their comings and goings (these are two things I struggle MIGHTILY with. This book made me want to hire Freya Marske to help me remember names and follow spatial directions).To those of you coming here from  A Marvellous Light, A Restless Truth  does an even better job of working the magic system into the moral universe of the story. Magic gets further enmeshed in questions of gender and power (and even though its only hinted at, imperialism) in ways that I want to scream about/write a dissertation on, but I CAN'T BECAUSE IT'S ALSO ALL SO SUSPENSEFUL AND EXCITING. And I loved how glimpses of Edwin and Robin's life were woven in through the story, primarily in how Maud thinks about them both as family: it was such a gentle and loving way to check in on them without having to do that awkward ""trot out the previous couples"" gesture we sometimes see in romance series. I get a bit choked up just thinking about it? How their relationship is so well-worn now that it just sinks into the way others think about home and family. The prose is, unsurprisingly, stunning. It is at once gorgeously etherial and intensely grounded and carnal. It's a bit ironic, because I at least attempt to make something of a brand for myself around explaining what I like about prose, and I simply CANNOT UNDERSTAND how the richness of this prose does not get tiring or overwhelming for me as a reader, but it never does. And seeing that prose in service of detailed, lingering, longing, dwelt-upon sex scenes between two women was an absolute pleasure. The words took the characters so deep into their own bodies, I don't really know any other way to put it. I am going to put, under a spoiler, a slightly more in-depth discussion of one of the sex scenes, that involves... what I can best describe as a bit of magical gender-bending? I thought it was handled sensitively, but I'm putting it here for anyone who wants further info around moments where sex stuff and gender stuff intersect trickily:  This happens during the second sex scene. Maud is a virgin and her first time has been with Violet just a few days ago. At that time, Maud expressed curiosity about a LOT of elements of Violet's sexual experience, including knowing what it's like to sleep with a man. In the present scene, Violet is demonstrating a bunch of magic for Maud - making flowers grow, exploding fireworks, and shows her how she disguises herself for one of her ""trouser roles"" - where she plays a man onstage. There's a thoughtful recognition right up front, in the dialogue, about how that's different from being trans, and how it's problematic that ""theatrical cross-dressing"" is something audiences often seek out in order to laugh at it. The experiences of trans actors Violet knows is also evoked. Violet leaves on some of the aspects of her ""trouser role"" costume and dances with Maud, she then leaves her ""moustache"" on while she goes down on her (this is something Maud explicitly expressed curiosity about- the feeling of facial hair during oral sex) and uses a dildo on her. I did not at any point feel like it veered into ""let's do it with a dildo and a mustache so you can finally see what it's like with a MAN"" territory, but I realize that others may feel differently, or may feel that the scene confused gender expression with ""magical disguise"" -- hence my rather detailed explanation of the scene. I hope that's not an overreach on my part. Anyway, I really did love this book immensely. Right up through the ending, which offers not only a very satisfying ""part 2 of 3"" conclusion to the mystery, but also gives our heroines a gorgeous HFN that respects the reality of their age, their experiences, and the time they've known each other. It also contains one of the most generous instances of allowing guarded characters to keep some secrets as they grow into love that ... honestly it made me cry. Into my mask. On the Amtrak train. I will be thinking about it for ages, until this book comes out, and I can talk about it with everyone I know.

59807966,A Restless Truth,EmmaSkies,115,1778,3,"November 25, 2022","Unfortunately I feel like this is a pretty weak follow up to A Marvellous Light (a book I LOVED). I didn't really dislike it, but I didn't love it and felt like it could have been quite a bit shorter than it is.Where A Marvellous Light had me in a chokehold from almost the very beginning I feel like I just didnâ€™t connect as well with this one. I didn't connect to Maud and Violet quite like I did with Robin and Edwin, which was a huge surprise to me because I was excited to read ""A Marvellous Light, But Make It Sapphic!."" I wonder if part of that is just that this couple and this book had pretty big shoes to fill, but even so I just didn't love Maud as a leading character. There were aspects of their dynamic that I enjoyed, but not enough to keep me super invested I suppose. I will say I really enjoyed the supporting cast! And the overall concept of the larger conspiracy we're seeing and the information we get to delve into in this one was interesting. I also enjoyed the dynamic with Maud discovering her sexuality for the first time and being exposed to the fact that women can love other women romantically and learning from and leaning on Violet through that discovery. But overall I ended up just not being very invested in the book. The setting also didn't work for me. I knew going in that the entire book would be contained to the ship and I didn't see an issue with that, but the problem for me ended up being that they barely even explored the ship. Most of the book takes place in a single hallway, a couple suites, and a dining room. This is a massive multileveled ship that if feels like we see maybe 20% of. The setting issue was one of a few reasons I think the book also ended up feeling really repetitive. Honestly I think it could have benefitted from being shorter to condense both the relationship and the murder mystery/conspiracy plot. I felt like I was reading a lot of the same information over and over.The magic and the way it's explored from Edwin's perspective in the first book was so unique and interesting, but in this book it felt very bland and very background. So much of the charm and the heart of A Marvellous Light was lost with this one, which is such a bummer considering HOW excited I was for this! I had to pause reading this for a while to read another book I had to finish on a deadline and I wasn't even all that upset to be putting it down. I'm holding out hope that this is just Second Book Syndrome and the last in the trilogy will bring it all back around",29,1 comment
59807966,A Restless Truth,Bethany (Beautifully Bookish Bethany),"1,892",3107,4,"October 28, 2022","Sapphic romance, magic, and shipboard murder! A Restless Truth has it all. In this followup to A Marvellous Light, we follow the sister of one of the main characters on board a ship. But shortly into the voyage, the old woman Maude was accompanying dies under mysterious circumstances. Enter Violet- the notorious heiress who ruined herself on the American stage. Sparks will fly and danger abounds as they try to track down the killer and a magical artifact.This was fun, and definitely steamy at times (much like book 1). Violet and Maude have a fun dynamic- Maude is inexperienced but doesn't lack a backbone. Violet has been hurt and has walls a mile high. And there is lots of magical danger! I didn't love this quite as much as book 1. I felt it dragged on a bit too long for the amount of plot, but also shipboard stories aren't my go to. If you enjoyed A Marvelous Light this is definitely worth the read and if we get more in the series I will certainly read those as well. They are a good time! The audio narrator is good, but I would have liked clearer distinction in voices between Maude and Violet's perspectives. I received an audio review copy via NetGalley, all opinions are my own.",27,2
59807966,A Restless Truth,Amy Imogene Reads,880,760,4,"November 17, 2022","4.5 stars!A ship traveling from America to England. A deadly game of find-that-magical-item. A fantastic sapphic romance. Oh and also? More of a truly engaging magical world. I love this series!Characters: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Pacing: â˜…â˜…Plot: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Enjoyment: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…Maud Blyth is on a mission. She's helping her brother, Robin, with his quest to save the magical community of Great Britain from some truly deadly stakes that we discovered in A Marvellous Light, the first book in the series. She's on her way back to Britain via steamship. It's not Maud's fault that her charge, an elderly woman holding a secret magical artifact, dies on the first day of their voyage. And it's not Maud's fault that said elderly lady never actually told her what item in her possession was the all-important magical artifact. Oof. Things aren't going to be so easy, after all. Good thing Maud Blyth is the best person to have in your corner when you're trapped and in need of assistance. Enter Violet Debenham from stage right, the beautiful and enigmatic heiress-to-be with a reputation she keeps in purposeful tatters and way too much personality and charm for any one room. She's a gravitational pull, and Maud finds herself helpless to resistâ€”and discovering that even she could, she may not want to escape Violet's embrace. And from stage left, the broody and constantly irritated Lord Hawthorne enters the scene as well with his anger, lack of magical ability, and tortured past. He's a reluctant player in Maud's play of Christie-like whodunit, but he's present and more helpful than nothing so Maud takes him into her stride too. With magicians, murder, and mayhem... We're in for a bumpy voyage. All aboard!!I am so pleased to report that A Restless Truth proved to be just as delightful as its first book, A Marvellous Light.I was initially bummed to find out that this book abandoned the characters from the first book (Robin and Edwin), but quickly found myself getting over it in the absolutely perfect character in Maud. Maud was everything. I loved her. (Don't get me wrong, I found Violet to be a ton of fun too in different ways, but MAUD!) There's just something about this quaint historical fantasy series that pushes all of my buttons. It's intriguing, yet not pulse-pounding. It's quaint and quiet, yet grips me. It has a dense and interesting magic structure and yet at no point do I feel lost or overburdened by complexity. It's ""just right,"" and continues to be. My only quibble with this installment was its limited setting... I am not a fan of boat-centered content. Or any other limited-setting story that traps our characters into a very small geographic range. Outside of certain mystery books with extreme action, this type of limited setting leads to me as the reader feeling trapped and pent-up in the mental reading space. It's hard for the plot to feel like it's moving along when our characters can only go from A to B... and back... and repeat. I wish this story had taken place somewhere else and given Maud, Violet, and the crew more room to breathe and explore. But, that in mind, I still greatly enjoyed this read. Eagerly awaiting book three!!Many thanks to Tordotcom for my copy in exchange for an honest review.Blog | Instagram",24,N/A
59807966,A Restless Truth,Laynie Rose,77,782,5,"June 26, 2022","Freya Marske has done it again! It's almost unbelievable how much I loved this book, how deeply I connected to it! Clever, sexy, and utterly enchanting, I want to get lost at sea with this book! Marske has completely captured my sapphic heart with this book!There was so so so much to love about this book. The romance within it gave me butterflies and left me teary eyed. The mystery and mayhem was delightful and intriguing. (I don't tend to be much of a mystery person, but Freya writes so spectacularly that I was enthralled the entire time, eager to know what would happen next!! ) The magic was cool as hell. The sex scenes were !!!!!!!! EVERYTHING! I really found myself identifying with our leading lady Maud Blyth, and almost like she was an extension of myself. I also love love loved Violet as a sapphic rake. More sapphics should get to be full of shit and fuck around!!!! It was delightful!!! The thing that surprised me the most in it was that it made me ADORE Lord Hawthorne, who I was not the biggest fan of in Book 1. I feel like I got to watch his layers be peeled back, and I saw a side of him that left a soft spot for him in my heart, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing where his story goes in the future. This book will work for you if you like magical mysteries, hilarious hauntings, and sapphic spicy scenes. Did you ever have a hyperfixation on the Titanic? Great, you're gonna like this book. Did you love Knives Out? Great, you're gonna like this book. Cannot recommend it enough, it's gonna be a hit!",22,1 comment
59807966,A Restless Truth,Megan Rose,169,13,5,"December 7, 2022","This series is so good! I already can't wait for the next one. As someone who completely adored A Marvellous Light, I was so, so thrilled to hear there would be a sequel. I will admit to being a little disappointed when I heard this one wouldn't be about Robin and Edwin. However, I was still super excited cause I loved Maud's character in the first book, and I just knew she'd be a fun protagonist to follow. And I was correct! A Restless Truth, while continuing the story of A Marvellous Light (just with different main characters), had a completely different tone and feel to it, which I loved. Each book contained a certain mystery aspect, but their settings and protagonists are very distinct to one another. This book felt like a victorian mystery novel with a dash of magic and romance. Because it took place on a ship, it also gave it that locked in feel, which is one of my favorite tropes! The world of the Last Binding series is so fascinating to me. How they utilize magic is done in a way I haven't really seen before, and since I've read a lot of fantasy books, that's pretty cool. Even though this book did focus on magic, I feel like the mystery aspect took center stage, which I had no qualms against. For Maud and Violet's journey, this just made sense. Even so, there was still a lot of suspense built up around the magicians trapped with them on the ship, and the uncertainty of who they could trust. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Having a romance take place over seven days was an interesting choice, but one that Freya Marske expertly executed. The way Maud and Violet's feelings for each other developed was so natural and authentic, while never feeling rushed. Their journey certainly wasn't smooth sailing (hah, puns), but I was rooting for them the whole time. Violet's character was a lot of fun because of how closed off she is to the world. She hides her true self behind a mask and very rarely allows anyone to get behind it. Maud, of course, begins to peek behind the facade, and that terrifies Violet. Both women are fierce and brave, but approach the world so differently. Maud is trusting, kind, and empathetic, whereas Violet is more cynical, harder to get to know, and more wary of others. This creates a wonderful dynamic between the two. They each push the other out of their comfort zones, but always for the better. I adored their relationship! A lot of people still seem to think there aren't that many great sapphic books out there, but that is so not true. This is just one example of a fantastic sapphic book. The chemistry between Maud and Violet was electric, but they were also sweet and caring towards the other. While Violet was already secure in who she was and who she's attracted to, Maud had never considered the idea of being with another woman, so it's a bit of a learning experience for her, and one Violet is there to help her through the entire time. In addition to Maud and Violet's dynamic, I also loved the found family vibes we got from Maud, Violet, Hawthorne, and Ross. I find Hawthorne's character so interesting. There's still a lot we don't know about him, but in this book we got a deeper look behind the gruff and uncaring man he presents himself as. His friendship with Maud and Violet might have been begrudging, but I loved their interactions. Adding Ross created the perfect group. All four are so distinct and varied in personalities and thoughts, so while their opinions may clash from time to time, they all work together really well. It also makes for some really funny moments that I won't spoil, but had me cackling with laughter. Between the suspenseful plot, electric relationship, and intriguing friend group, A Restless Truth was a wild ride worth every second of my time. I can't wait to see where this story goes in the next book (and I have an inkling for who I think it'll be about!). The Last Binding is without a doubt one of my favorite series. Historical fiction? Romance? Fantasy? Mystery? What more can a person ask for? Not to mention, Freya Marske's writing style is elegant and clean, making for an engaging and quick read. If you haven't read A Marvellous Light or a Restless Truth yet, I highly recommend it! Thank you to Pride Book Tours for providing me with a physical copy of the book, and to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with a digital ARC in exchange for my honest opinion!",19,N/A

  On my blog.
Actual rating 3.5Rep: lesbian mc, bi mc, bi side characterGalley provided by publisherA Restless Truth is, I think, a book which benefited from my having a clearer idea of what this series is aiming to be. That is, I would primarily call this a romance series, with a little plot which links the books together. I didnâ€™t understand that while reading A Marvellous Light, but now I do. As such, I think I enjoyed this one a lot more.The story picks up not long after the ending of A Marvellous Light, only this time weâ€™re following Maud, who is journeying back from America in the company of one of the people Robin and Edwin have been searching for. Only, things come a little unstuck when the lady winds up murdered.As I said at the start, knowing more about how the book would go actually helped my enjoyment of it. My main issue in the first book was the lack of balance between the mystery and romance aspects of the plot, along with some handwaving over the worldbuilding. The latter is still there, obviously, but the former has improved twofold: firstly, due to what I expected from the book, and secondly, I genuinely think this one has a better balance between those aspects.It also helped that, while I did like the cast of the first book, I so much more liked the cast of the second. They really hit every sweet spot, and make me so so excited for book 3 (that is, if I think who the leads are going to be is correct, and Iâ€™m reasonably certain of it). I canâ€™t wait to see what happens when these four collide with Robin, Edwin and Adelaide. I predict chaos in the best way possible.The plot too, I think, was better paced than the previous bookâ€”I just remember a large chunk of that where anything mystery-related and therefore, presumably, quite time sensitive, took a backseat and I got bored. There was none of that here, really. Yes, there were scenes which, despite the fact I liked them, I was a little confused how they added to the plot, but overall it was much better in that respect.Really, if I had to make any complaint about this book, itâ€™s that itâ€™s made me obsessively stuck on thinking about the potential book 3 characters for weeks now. I donâ€™t have time for this! I need my brain back! And they werenâ€™t even the main characters. (Which, by the way, is a hint for you to get reading this series.)",14,N/A
59807966,A Restless Truth,Vini,444,57,4,"December 2, 2022","i would just like to say i'm a lord hawthorn stan first! human second!""She would step off the ship in triumph, and Robin would be proud of her, and it would be the first important and worthwhile thing that Maud Blythe, baronet's daughter, and baronet's sister, would have done in her entire short useless life.""The most interesting things in Maud Blyth's life have happened to her brother Robin, but she's ready to join any cause, especially if it involves magical secrets. Bound for New York on the R.M.S. Lyric, she's ready for an adventure. What she actually finds is a dead body, a disrespectful parrot, and a beautiful stranger in Violet Debenham, who is everythingâ€”a magician, an actress, a scandalâ€”Maud has been trained to fear and has learned to desire. Surrounded by the open sea and a ship full of loathsome suspects, they must solve a murder and untangle a conspiracy that began generations before them.A Marvellous Light was one of the last few books I read last year, and I loved it so much (but it will be featured in this year's favorites bc my list was done by the time I first read it).So I was eagerly looking forward to this sequel ever since last December, but, at the same time, I was a little hesitant about it. I loved Robin & Edwin so much that I doubted another couple would surpass them. Also, Maud wasn't the best character from the first book. She was just there, so I didn't know how to feel about an entire book about her.But!! I shouldn't have doubted because I really enjoyed A Restless Truth. I didn't LOVE it as much as AML, but it was still an incredible addition to this series.If A Marvellous Light is a soft mystery with romance all about the mortifying ordeal of being known amidst magic gardens, magic houses, and wallpaper, A Restless Truth is the complete opposite. Instead, it's a fun book all about a murder mystery while traveling on a ship.This book was simply so much fun. I just love stories where the characters are stuck in a place with a killer in their midst, with them having to figure out the mystery. While also keeping the investigation a secret.And all of the characters were so great. Even the side characters!! I'm now obsessed with Lord Hawthorne. I'm a Hawthorne stan first, human second. Mean characters with tragic pasts that deal with their trauma with humor, vulgarity, and by pushing everyone away?? And then will probably eventually find someone that understands and loves them for who they are?? I love that every time.Even though I wasn't sure how I felt about Maud before, I loved her in this one. She's stubborn and is constantly trying to prove herself, but always stands up for herself against anyone; who just wants to do right by those she loves.My only issue with this book is that I didnâ€™t /really/ love the romance. I liked it? I think? So much of this story is about Maud and Violet trying to be honest with each other, and they only get the actual truth by the end. So finishing this, I felt that their romance wasn't over? It felt like a beginning, more than an end.That makes me wonder how the next book is going to go!! I'm hoping it will be about Ross and Hawthorne (if it isn't, I WILL riot), but will we also get perspectives from the other characters? Idk but I'm excited about it!!",13,3
