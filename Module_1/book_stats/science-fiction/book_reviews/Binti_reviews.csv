25667918,Binti,Nataliya,710,11300,2,"February 11, 2022","This is... cute, I guess. Imaginative. Fresh. But yet lacking so much of what makes a cohesive seamless narrative that I am indeed surprised to see that it won the Nebula Award. I hate to call this one childish for the one reason: good stories aimed at the youngsters should possess the wonderful level of imagination and complexity. And this one has all the foundations, so wonderfully laid out in its strong beginning, promising the strangeness of mathematical reasoning weaved together with the tribal culture rites. But, sadly, the promising start quickly disintegrates into a story that blithely speeds along to the conclusion it desires while ignoring character building, logic, and any resemblance to the actual complexity in the interpersonal (interspecies here, I guess?) relationships.I guess I must call this story, despite the imaginative and fresh initial premise, just simplistic and naive. Because this is how we wish the world would work: forgiving any murder or war and accepting your enemies once a miscommunication of sorts has been cleared (or magically covered with magical mud, if you so wish) and harmoniously living ever after in a wonderfully harmonious universe. And about that mass murder that was just shrugged off? Well, sorry, but now we are cool, I guess, and even participate in a sort of a student exchange program? Ugh.Acceptance does not work like this. It really does not. Sorry.Anyway, I'm not sure how this ended up getting such accolades. Okorafor has written much better stories but this is sadly lacking. But yes, cute.2.5 stars.——————Also posted on my blog.",274,32
25667918,Binti,karen,"3,968",17000,3,"June 13, 2018","WINNER!!! 2015 nebula for best novella!! shows what i know!and now hugo winner, too! i cannot be trusted to speak about books! i know nothing!having been gleefully freeloading off the free tor shorts for years now, i absolutely want to support tor in their ""buy some novellas, cheapskate""* endeavor, especially since the first one i read - Every Heart a Doorway - was one of the best things i have ever read ever. but even though Binti won/was nominated for a billion awards, it was only medium-enjoyable for me. i'd read Lagoon by this author, with the same general reaction (even though I KNOW everyone tells me Who Fears Death is incredible, and i believe them and i will read that one, because every author gets three chances with me)this is the first book in what i expect will be a trilogy, and it's only 90 pages, so it's hard to be hypercritical of it, although just now reading the synopsis for part 2, it takes place a year later, so i guess this part of it is over and i can be as critical as with any other book. so - first, the good things: i really like the character. 16-year-old binti comes from the isolated himba region whose desert community holds fast to its customs and where the emphasis is on family, science, and a connection to the land so deep that no one ever leaves their homeland. however, binti, despite the privileges of her family, cannot refuse the unprecedented opportunity to study at the oozma university, which offer has never before been granted to a himba. I was sixteen years old and had never been beyond my city, let alone near a launch station. I was by myself and I had just left my family. My prospects of marriage had been 100 percent and now they would be zero. No man wanted a woman who'd run away. However, beyond my prospects of a normal life being ruined, I had scored so high on the planetary exams in mathematics that the Oozma University had not only admitted me, but promised to pay for whatever I needed in order to attend. No matter what choice I made, I was never going to have a normal life, really.on her journey towards the terminal, binti feels her outsider status acutely. because her people never leave their land; because they are so insular, other people assign characteristics to them through lack of contact/experience: they are assumed to be backwards, primitive, and filthy, in part because of the himba custom of smearing their bodies and hair with a fragrant paste made from the clay of their land, as well as their darker skin and fuzzy hair.once binti makes it to the ship (which is actually a living creature ""closely related to a shrimp""), surrounded by other prospective students, she has an easier time acclimating, and even makes friends and develops a crush on a boy. and then the meduse arrive, and everything goes sideways.for the characters and this reader both. again, binti is a remarkable character - she's plucky, brave, resourceful, and supersmart but she's not unrealistically heroic and capable - she's never experienced life beyond her home and family, and her discomfort and awkwardness are appropriate for someone with her background. i also appreciated the attention to detail given to the customs of her people, and her memories of her life among them. but from the meduse part on, there seemed to be a motivation to reach a desired ending without respecting the consequences of certain actions, which brad addresses admirably in his review, to which i can add nothing more because it speaks to every single ""but wait"" objection i had while reading this and i don't wanna be a plagiarist. like him, i appreciate the message, but the delivery of the message was a bit trite and slapdash. however, i like the character enough (and i owe tor enough), that i will likely read the second part of this. this novella is completely appropriate for a YA audience, and i think it would be better received by younger readers, who tend to read more for plot and enjoyment than old folks like me who suck all the joy out of books with too-nitpicky dissections resulting from too much academic training in joy-sucking.i still love you, tor, and i will continue to love you both for free and for ca$h.*not actual name of programcome to my blog!",254,27
25667918,Binti,Lyn,"1,845",16300,4,"March 23, 2019","I like originality and I also like a story told economically and writer Nnedi Okorafor gets my high praise in both categories for her 2015 novella Binti.Okorafor has created in Binti a speculative fiction gem where a reader is led along a culturally alien yet approachable thrill ride. At once fascinating and hair raising, Okorafor has crafted a dynamic tension that grips the reader throughout this short work.Binti is a student who has been accepted into a far future academy and chooses to attend the university over the protests and prohibitions of her traditional and isolationist family. Being the first of her family from a rural area of Earth, itself described as something of a planetary backwater, to go to this school is difficult enough for Binti, but Okorafor then introduces a far more dangerous cultural conflict through which Binti must survive.Told with an intensity found more in the horror or thriller genres, this speculative fiction work blends elements of science fiction and fantasy into a very entertaining whole that is reminiscent of Octavia Butler or Ursula K. Le Guin. I also considered a comparison to China Mieville. Okorafor’s use of cultural distinctions, probably inspired from her Nigerian heritage, further separates this very unique novella from the pack of contemporary fiction.I have long heard her name and knew that I would need to explore her writing. Binti is likely only the first of Okorafor’s work I will enjoy.",174,11
25667918,Binti,carol.,"1,501",7547,3,"February 1, 2016","Binti is a curious little novella by Okorafor, an author who has been my radar for bringing winds of Africa into science fiction and fantasy, and it does not disappoint. A sixteen-year old woman of the Himba tribe has been accepted into the prestigious Oomza University on a mathematics scholarship. The trouble is, “we Himba don’t travel. We stay put. Our ancestral land is life; move away from it and you diminish. We even cover our bodies with it… Here, in the launch port… I was an outsider; I was outside.“An auspicious, classic beginning, one that captures the uncertainty of an unusually talented woman stretching beyond her tightly knit culture to experience something larger. “No matter what choice I made, I was never going to have a normal life, really.” Okorafor deftly creates Binti’s character, bringing to mind the old days when I was seventeen and heading off across the country to college. Binti also faces all the prejudices that come from those unfamiliar with her culture. However, once she gets to the transport ship, she meets other young people also heading to the University and begins to find a kind of equilibrium and friendship. Until the Meduse come, five days before they are supposed to arrive at Uni.Once the alien Meduse attack, it evolves into first a survival story and then an alien outreach, with the plotting and writing less deft as the themes shift. Another incomprehensible alien artifact becomes a deux ex machina until rapport can be developed. Actually, I suppose that is very normal for the fantastical young adult-discovery tales; some magical object that gives them an unusual edge or specialness. In this case, I rather felt like it diminished the focus on Binti, who earlier was in the process of trying to recognize and honor her personal uniqueness.The ending didn’t quite work for me; I felt like it dismissed early losses for the ‘greater good,’ the satisfactory resolution of the idealistic ethical issue, and I’m not sure that was the message meant. More significantly, like Lagoon, I wondered if there was a bit too much attempted in such a limited format. There’s a galaxy of other beings, unknown alien artifacts, a future-Earth that has technologies unusual to our own, living ships, and then the very fascinating concept of mathematical harmonics. I would have thought either expanding more, so more organic integration of information could occur (ie, no pseudo-technology info-dumping), or limiting the scope would service the complexity of the story better.The overall verdict is that one should read it, if you are interested in diving into fresh voices in science fiction, and in stories where cultural and ethnic issues are woven into genre traditions. Okorafor is worth trying.Cross posted: https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2016/...",154,15

25667918,Binti,Feyre,102,238,1,"February 1, 2018","“But deep down inside me, I wanted . . . I needed it. I couldn’t help but act on it. The urge was so strong that it was mathematical.” ― Nnedi Okorafor, BintiI can't believe this won a Hugo and a Nebula award !! Apparently this is supposed to be a science fiction novella, offering a protagonist from an African background who is a genius at mathematics and who leaves her tribe to go to Oomza university on another planet. Unfortunately i found this book to be tiring and boring, the writing bland !! Also Binti wasn't some kind of a badass main character since all she did besides chatting with the enemy was talking about her ""otjize"", making ""otjize"" , applying ""otjize"" to her hair and trying to explain it's nature to other people throughout THE WHOLE FUCKING BOOK !!!",108,23
25667918,Binti,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,2,"July 19, 2017","I don't get the hype. Yes, culturally diverse - I like the main character and her background, but as an actual science fiction work, it's very weak.",103,7
25667918,Binti,Elle (ellexamines),"1,079",17200,4,"August 2, 2020","When I first read Binti in 2017, I enjoyed it fine, but I don’t think I understood it as being particularly Good. Reading it again in 2019, after reading far more fantasy and science fiction (and a significant amount of postcolonial literature), I think I got a lot more from these 85 pages. Binti is a young black woman on her way to the premier institution in the galaxy; her people, unlike their sometime-rivals sometime-allies the Kush, almost never leave. She has broken this tradition (an absolute first-generation college student) through being extremely smart, and she has done something perhaps more revolutionary: she has chosen to take her chance and leave home. Though her parents love her, they don’t approve of her choosing to go somewhere where she will not continue their traditions. She knows from the time she leaves that she may very well be disowned. She herself isn’t entirely confident either; she self-doubts multiple times in the first twenty pages, despite her joy. On her journey to her new university, however, her ship is attacked by a race known as the Meduse. These creatures are murderous, of course, but Binti, and the audience, eventually learn to look at them with empathy. Their stinger has been stolen and placed in a Kush museum, in something akin to the colonial appropriation perpetuated by the British museum today. The Meduse have been violated, and thus they want to recapture and reclaim their lost territory.The growth of the friendship between Okwu and Binti is at the center of Binti — and the ensuing novella series, though to a lesser degree — and though it forms due to necessity, the strength of this relationship comes in their mutual understandings of each other. Their hair, like her hair, is considered alien; their bodies, like hers, are considered other. Their friendship is always what resonates with me the most when thinking about this series. Binti’s journey, however, is what is most revolutionary about this book. Instead of following traditions, she breaks boundaries; she has a place in the universe, and yet she steps out into a whole new world. In a subversion of the typical outsider-leaves-to-find-themselves narrative, she is not in any particular way an outsider to her initial community; she is simply brilliant and quietly ambitious and brave enough to risk all she has ever known for a future she hopes will be for her. Throughout the story, as a harmonizer, she must symbolically give up pieces of her old identity, yet she keeps her old rituals as a part of herself. Her strength comes in her ability to embrace both her old identity and her new identity and build herself into a whole person, stronger than ever. A black woman, and a young black woman, is front and center, and she is front and center because of her inner strength and her empathy. And that's just really neat. I really struggled to engage with this the first time around, something that I attributed to ""not liking novellas,"" which I thought I ""struggled to be engaged in before the end"". I am no longer a boring sad person who dislikes everything she doesn't get (I was 16, let me live) and I now love novellas. However, this problem of lacking engagement persists, and it is because of the lack of description. I love this world — the ideas of sentient ships and Oomza Uni both slap so hard — but I don't feel like I have any perception of what it looks like. I believe this must have been a purposeful decision for symbolic reasons, because it feels... very conscious. However, I did really like this on reread.

25667918,Binti,Philip,496,660,3,"May 2, 2017","3ish stars. This is a 90-something page novella that tries to pack so much in that it ends up reading like the SparkNotes of a full novel. The worldbuilding is very cool. I especially like the idea of an organic animal-type spacecraft. And Binti's culture (which, upon reading the afterword, I found to be based on an actual group of people in Namibia) is awesome. It'd be cool to see more of this universe (the Oomzi University especially) and its various inhabitants, but that's not my main issue with the length. Now, I'm a fan of the novella format. Some books work really well in that format, Every Heart a Doorway and Sunbolt being a couple of the recent ones I've read. And, let's be honest, sometimes I only have the patience to read a book that's 100 pages long. I'm even more lenient when the novella is part of a series as this one is so that subsequent books can provide some expansion. But it appears the next book in this series takes place a year in the future and follows a new plotline, essentially closing the case on the events that transpired in this book. Unfortunately, those events are the ones that need some expansion. The book pretty much follows this streamlined formula: 1) Event 1 takes place  I got accepted to a great university, but my family doesn't want me to go and my culture makes me an outsider. 2) Event 2 takes place  I end up going and make some cool friends, here are their names.3) Conflict 1 arises  Actually, you didn't really need to know their names, they're dead now. Some jellyfish aliens killed everyone on board my ship.4) Conflict 2 arises  I'm trapped; aliens want to kill the entire human race because a human took their chief's stinger. Despite supposedly being highly intelligent beings, they've concocted a plan with very little hope of success to retrieve the stinger from the Uni using violent force and very little subtlety.5) Conflict 1 is resolved by deus ex machina Turns out a random item I just so happened to find a few years ago just so happens to be the only thing that keeps me from befalling the same death as everyone else aboard. It also just so happens to give me the ability to communicate with the aliens.6) Conflict 2 is resolved by deus ex machina Turns out the otjize my people make from oil and clay to cover their skin and hair with just so happens to heal the aliens making us insta-friends.7) Conflict 3 arises Upon arriving at the Uni, we get an audience with the various leaders (me acting as diplomat with my new tentacle hair) and I explain to them that my alien friends slaughtered everyone on the ship so they could get their stinger back.8) All conflict is resolved. Everyone's cool with it.THE ENDThere's really nothing in between to (in my opinion, at least) allow for much tension or style. I don't really get why this wasn't expanded into a novel. It's good, but it could have been a lot better.https://mrphilipslibrary.wordpress.co...",92,4
25667918,Binti,Aneela ♒the_mystique_reader♒,168,95,3,"June 4, 2017","I previously rated this book 4 stars but now that I think of it, its not worth 4 stars so I am removing 1 star.Binti is a Himba. She lives in a city and crafts astrolabes with her father. She got selected for the Oomza University that is on another planet. She is the first one to be selected from her tribe as well as her city. Her family is against her going to the university so she flee to the town in the dark of night. On her way to the other planet, their spaceship got attacked by the aliens. Aliens with tentacles.....I loved the world-building. The description of how their spaceship is built and all that. However I managed to find few plot holes in the story. How did the folks from another planet managed to steal from the head of aliens if they were so fierce and have super powers. So yeah, a little back story might have earned that 1 star. It is a light read though. There are no complicated characters, twists or turns that may clench your heart. I found it refreshing after finishing the pile of ARCs so any of you folks who are looking forward to read something to shake you up from reading slump, this book might help you.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",84,3
25667918,Binti,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,4,"October 18, 2019","The world needs more revolutionary, progressive social Sci-Fi like that. The evolution of Sci-Fi, that was a long time a predominantly weirdhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychol...genre leads to a much wider and more multicultural approach with settings of people of different cultures, traditions, mythologies, nations, civilizations and ideologies. For instance Buddhism and Asian mentality mixed with immortality, AI, resurrection, hive minds, etc. Or biopunk genre based on indigenous people living in rainforests and unexplored nature and wilderness all around the world. The whole Gaia mentality mixed with all kinds of emancipation, feminism and cultural rebellion. What unbelievable kind of social Sci-Fi may grow out of these new ways of telling a story with often overused tropes may be astonishing. No more old macho stereotypes with the evil aliens, mainly evil industries and mainly superficial social studies. Women are to a certain extent simply better at describing emotional und especially empathic characters and protagonist driven plots and Sci-Fi is the genre with the most possibilities to let the most amazing dreams come true, cause elements of fantasy, history and, of course, many sciences can be mixed in. Especially social sciences, be it relations between aliens and humans, different developing humans, robots or AIs and anyone. I have read hundreds, hopefully once in decades thousands, of Sci-Fi novels and got used to a nice, but quite kind of monotonous way of telling the story. First at the beginning, the genre was extremely egocentric, not to say, megalomaniac, as many of the old masters of the genre could be described as. The funny thing is that they used to describe utopias with old and mostly evil gender and race stereotypes, not recognizing that not just the tech, but humanity as a whole may evolve too and forgot to or didn´t want to mention it in their novels. After that came the more plot-driven steampunk, Spaceopera, Cyberpunk and Hard Sci-Fi genres with a mostly male protagonist. Now, finally, in the 21 century, more and more great stories, written by women, I would say to a certain extent not writeable by men, come to enrich the life of avid readers. ",78,6

25667918,Binti,Ana,60,286,3,"April 15, 2019","Stuck between 2.5 and 3, gave this novella a 3 eventually. It was an enjoyably good and quick read.The bravery of a 16 year old girl leaving everything for the sake of her curiosity of knowing further, her survival instinct, the eden and otjize; were the factors that pulled me in but lost me when there was a lack of strong character and story development around all these!The feelings grew and died immaturely and all jumbled upon each other!Though the details about the traditions and customs of the protagonist's region and people attracted my attention and I found myself wanting to know more about them.For being a novella, the plot was simple but interesting. It could have been much more intriguing and adventurous if it had more twists and then brought to a specific conclusion. It seemed to be written in a hurry just to convey the story with many unaddressed issues and loose ends. It wasn't written impressively enough to hook the readers, so it didn't turn out to be a page turner for me! Although in my opinion, this plot had a huge potential if it was written patiently with knots tying all the minute details together.

25667918,Binti,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,"1,878",22600,4,"January 29, 2019","Starting off on my adventures with Binti, a mathematically brilliant, 16 year old member of the technically advanced but socially isolated Namibian Himba tribe. Binti decides -against massive family pressure - to accept a full-ride scholarship to the Oomza University on another planet. So she sneaks off in the dead of night, without telling her family. On the spaceship ride to Planet Oomza (or whatever its name is), disaster strikes, and Binti is forced to change and grow as a result.This Hugo and Nebula award-winning novella has a serviceable SF plot (with several rather noticeable holes in it) but an amazing heroine that, for me, more than makes up for the plot’s weaknesses. She's unusual and complex and feels real to me. Nnedi Okorafor’s writing style is also appealing. Full review to come!

25667918,Binti,Melanie,"1,148",97700,4,"February 10, 2017","Binti is a beautiful Sci-Fi story about a girl who leaves her family and their dreams for her behind, because she has much bigger dreams for herself. 
  
    “We prefer to explore the universe by traveling inward, as opposed to outward.”
  
This novella received quite a bit of hype at the end of last year, and I've been meaning to read it since it released, but after winning a Nebula and a Hugo I knew I couldn't let 2016 go by without reading it. Plus, look at that cover. I mean, it's honestly to die for.Binti feels comfort with numbers and logic. She has been accepted not only to the best university in the world, but she has been accepted as the first Himba student. After escaping her desert home on Earth, where everything feels comfortable and she is highly praised as being the most intelligent member of her community, she finds herself among people who are very different than herself and most of those people openly give their opinions on their differences. Eventually she makes friends with her soon to be fellow students. Binti is one of five-hundred passengers on a ship headed to the university, until a jellyfish-like alien race called the Meduse board their ship without mercy.Binti finds herself in a very scary and unusual position where she has to take the customs of her people, the knowledge from her family, and her belief for her own future to be able to change the world forever. While reading this, I kept thinking about how wonderful this book would be for middle grade readers. Religious and cultural acceptance is a concept that is never too early to start teaching your children. There are so many beautiful references to different cultures that really puts a heavy emphasis on their importance. We take for granted the beauty behind the rituals and customs of different cultures, when we really should be celebrating them. Yet, the juxtaposition is equally as beautiful with the reminder that we are all free to try or to embrace a new culture without feeling shame, nor should we be exiled for turning our backs on the culture we were inherently born into if we were to venture out and try a new custom.Like I said, this book makes a huge statement about acceptance and how we can miscommunicate with others unintentionally. The message is truly beautiful, and it is no wonder this book has made such an impact and won so many awards; Binti truly is a beautiful message that more people need to hear.Tor is seriously publishing some amazing novellas lately, too. Binti and Every Heart a Doorway are both phenomenal, and I can't wait to read more of their stories, especially with the diversity that both of those novellas have inside of them.
