18077752,Acceptance,Will Chin,545,19,2,"February 18, 2016","That's it? Well, I must admit, I feel a little hoodwinked. Acceptance is a noticeably better book than Authority, but that is not saying a lot, considering that the second book in the series is dreadful in every sense of the word. Just when you thought that the middle chapter of a trilogy cannot get any more weighted down, Authority showed up to prove us all wrong. Every page towards the end felt like a sucker punch to the guts, and it took great determination to pick up the next and final book in the series. Thankfully, in Acceptance, the book is divided into three story lines: The Lighthouse Keeper's, the Director's and Control's (or Ghost Bird's). The good thing is that because you spend 2/3 of the time away from Control, the worst character in the book, you are less bothered by how mind-numblingly bad his character is. He continues to wallow in his thoughts and being slightly out of touch with the situation at hand, and he's in a constant state of denial. To think that we spent a whole book with the guy, I do wonder how I pulled through till the end. The Lighthouse Keeper and the Director both have fairly interesting stories to tell, although they both sort of dissolve into underwhelming fuzz towards the end. They provide an interesting perspective to the creation of Area X, as well as the Director's motivations up until her death in book one. The problem, however, is that Area X as a character (and yes, it is a character) does not progress forward in the plot. Instead, through the Lighthouse Keeper and the Director's story lines, Area X actually develops BACKWARDS. Essentially, you learn nothing new about Area X beyond the chronological point established in book one. Acceptance does reveal answers to some lingering questions, yes, but it doesn't move the plot FORWARD. Perhaps this is Vandermeer's way of preserving some of the mysteries, but place in better hands, Area X could have been so much more. Arthur C Clarke did a masterful job with his work on the Odyssey series, especially 2010: Odyssey Two. In there, he provides answers/closures to the mysteries established in book one, and yet leave enough doors open for more mysteries to come. Vandermeer's closures here are sloppy at best, almost amateurish. If you hated the way LOST gathered the loose ends and threw it at your face back in 2010, you are really going to hate the way Vandermeer chooses to end his yarn here. Also, Area X is supposed to be at the forefront of the story. In Annihilation, it was the main character, and the humans were essentially sacrificial lambs to the overarching mystery. They didn't even have names to begin with! In books two and three, however, Area X is in the backseat while the human characters are put at the forefront. There's nothing wrong with that provided that the human characters are good, and that we can relate to them on some level. However, none of the characters end up being anything more like caricatures. They are constantly questioning themselves and wallowing in their own sense of self-doubt and misery, like characters from a Murakami book, and they don't ever snap out of it even after the trilogy ends. Halfway through the second book, I started to miss the creepiness of Area X, and I wanted to go back to the ""tower"". I didn't want to stay at Southern Reach anymore, and the characters weren't interesting enough for me to want to stick around at the party. Overall, the Southern Reach trilogy has been an overwhelming disappointment. Book one was the perfect set up for a series, with enough mysteries to keep the readers guessing. If you intend on reading the series, pick up the first book, read it from cover to cover, then ask yourself if you are comfortable with not knowing any concrete answers. The answers provided in Acceptance aren't terrible per se, but the execution of the story is the series' Achilles' Heel. Again, Vandermeer pulled a LOST here, with the perfect set up and an unsatisfying ending. I'm not sure what the other reviewers on Goodreads read, but I certainly did not read the same book as everyone else. ",224,28
18077752,Acceptance,carol.,"1,501",7547,4,"November 20, 2014","From my blog: https://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/...Once again, Vandermeer astonishes me with evocative, symbolic language:“The fifth morning I rose from the grass and dirt and sand, the brightness had gathered to form a hushed second skin over me, that skin cracking from my opening eyes like the slightest, the briefest, touch of an impossibly thin later of ice. I could hear the fracturing of its melting as if it came from miles and years away.“And once again, Area X takes center stage in the last book of The Southern Reach Trilogy. The narrative switches between Ghost Bird and Control, last met in Authority; Saul, the lighthouse keeper; the psychologist Gloria, and perhaps one or two others that slip in. The narrative is done well enough that the separate voices do not feel disjointed, but I warn you: pay attention to chapter titles, as they say who is speaking. The story also flows back and forth in time, filling in the stories of people introduced, backgrounds and events alluded to but never explained. The insight into characterization provides more interest than in it did in the first two books; thankfully so, as the plotting explodes, much like a cell line on the upswing of reproduction (apparently a recent TED talk on angiogenesis is leaking in).“You note again not just the musculature of this woman but the fact that she’s willing to complicate even the simple business of stating her name. “As the capstone to a trilogy, it has mixed success. I understand a number of the metaphors and plot connections being made, but I wasn’t sure the gestalt was worth the effort. Yet as I randomly flipped back through the book looking for sections that had stood out (unsurprisingly, I had lost my sticky-note), I was caught again into reading long passages, first hooked by the writing and then pulled deeper by glimpsing hints to the puzzle of Area X.But here’s the thing: there were also long passages that made me quite sleepy, and, as usual, I have a number of other non-book things at that periphery of my consciousness, peeping for attention. If I would have loved this, it may have been worth a re-read to better understanding of the genesis of Area X and the relationship the characters have with it. But it isn’t, not right now. Still, the writing is something special, as well as the concept, and I can always get behind a good environmental message. I recommend it, with the caveats that you are wide awake and in the mood for ambiguity and metaphor.""‘I can’t go down there,’ Whitby says, in such a final way that he must be thinking that in the descent he would no longer be Whitby. The hollows of his face, even in that vibrant, late-summer light, make him look haunted by a memory he hasn’t had yet.“",122,26
18077752,Acceptance,Kaora,549,279,5,"October 11, 2018","For those of you like me who loved Annihilation and struggled with Authority, you will be happy to know that this book is more like Annihilation than Authority. We are back in Area-X with Ghost Bird and Control, although there are multiple view points alternating through this book that also bring us back to the history of Area-X.The thing that I adore most about these books is the writing. The haunting metaphors that set the tone for this mind-fuck of a novel. The pacing was perfect, and the book drew me in from the first page and did not let go, something I struggled with a midst the politics of Authority.The characters can be a bit confusing, especially since many of them have given up their prior names and go by nicknames. Such as Biologist, The Director or Control, although they may be referred to as their other names on occasion. This is not a book that you can speed read, since you will miss some important details, and not get the full effect of the amazing writing.While it doesn't answer all the questions posed in the first two books, I do feel like many of the important ones are answered, and I love it when details that seem insignificant come back in a big way. Chekhov's guns in disguise, just waiting to go off. It makes me want to go back and re-read the entire series, so I can discover elements I never noticed before.While everything isn't tied up in a neat little package, Vandermeer allows us to draw our own conclusions from the end, a fitting finish for this trilogy and one that will keep you thinking about this book hours after you close it.Highly recommended for fans of weird Science Fiction or weird in general.Cross posted at: Kaora's Corner",115,14
18077752,Acceptance,Lyn,"1,845",16300,3,"September 19, 2019","The face of someone watching Mulholland Drive for the first time.For me, I was mesmerized by the first two books in the trilogy, entranced by VanderMeer’s writing like watching a cool street magician. But the bubble burst here and I blinked and came back to the world, realizing that while it was entertaining and fun to watch, the performance art was only just that.Taking themes, styles and inspiration from JG Ballard, Jack Finney, and Eugène Ionesco, Jeff VanderMeer has crafted an extraordinarily original story of environmental and biological concerns.Magic realism and inventive allegory abounds and VanderMeer demonstrates not only his great talent but also his deft ability to form an impressionistic vision of environmentalism.For speculative fiction literati.",94,6
18077752,Acceptance,Mike,475,368,3,"October 6, 2014","I am afraid to report that I found the final installment of The Southern Reach Trilogy to be a disappointment and let down. After really enjoying the first two books in this series, Annihilation and Authority this verdict pains me. VanderMeer succeeded in creating this weird, amazing world populated by fascinating characters. But all the promise and potential of the first two books were squandered, in my opinion, by Acceptance's ending.Spoilers for the series and this book follow, so be wary.The first two books were told from one point of view, the Biologist and Control respectively. This allows VanderMeer to establish a very specific atmosphere for each of these books: a strange, alien, yet seemingly pristine, natural environmental for Annihilation and a byzantine bureaucratic labyrinth that Control must get control of in Authority. Acceptance, in a departure from this pattern, provided multiple points of view. To a degree this is good. I got to see some past events in the Director's and Lighthouse Keeper's lives before Area X manifested and before the events of Annihilation. I found the character of the Director and the Lighthouse keeper to be quite interesting and enjoyable. However, this shattering of the narrative prevented a definitive ambience from being established. As a result I did not feel as immersed in this book as the previous books.But my biggest problem with this book is the lack a closure for the majority of the characters. I can certainly understand the choices to leave the fates of Control and the Biologist ambiguous at the end of the first two books. But when this book ends, we do not know the fate of Control (or what his new form is or what was in the shining light), what befell earth/Area X (not to mention Lowry and Southern Reach) as Ghostbird and Gloria pick their way through a transformed landscape, what the final fate of the transformed lighthouse keeper, and why Area X was so interested in the Director's memories. I was left expecting some sort of closure for these character arcs but never got it. I really liked how VanderMeer constructed Area X. It was the very definition of alien, lacking a common ground for humans to interact with it. I think the nature of Area X vis a vis humanity was aptly summer up by Saul the lighthouse keeper.Saul: That fish down there sure is frightened of you.Gloria: Huh? It just doesn't know me. If it knew me, that fish would shake my hand.Saul:I don't think there's anything you could say to convince it of that. And there are all kinds of ways you could hurt it without meaning to.And that is Area X encapsulated. Humanity is the fish that Area X is unable to communicate with and it is indeed hurting us as it tried to communicate and make sense of Earth. In fact I thought the nature Area X was pretty darn nifty: a sort of biological Von Neumann Probes from a dead world that it tries to recreate. And humans (among everything else) is just raw material for it to sculpt as it sees fit.There is a lot of love about this book. I loved the Ligthhouse Keeper character and his relationship with Gloria. I thought is was awesome what the biologist turned into, but would have liked a lot more about her instead of her just being a near mindless force of nature. I liked the personal journey of the Director and her maneuverings against Lowry (which was a character I would have loved to have gotten to know better). The Seance and Science Brigade was very intriguing but woefully underdeveloped.Had this book merely been the third installment of a four (or more) book series this would have been a solid four star book. But because this is (as far as I am aware) the end of the line, the lack of closure and resolution really rankled me. If you are going to make me care so much about the characters in the story, at least do my the courtesy of telling me what befalls them.",89,7
18077752,Acceptance,Heidi The Reader,"1,366",1413,3,"July 10, 2017","Acceptance answers any lingering questions that the reader may have concerning Area X. I found it much more satisfying than the second entry. But, I don't think that either the second or third book approached the brilliance of the first.Beyond the revelations about Area X, this book also explains some of the relationships between characters. ""Sometimes.. other people gave you their light, and could seem to flicker, to be hardly visible at all, if no one took care of them. Because they'd given you too much and had nothing left for themselves."" pg 60.The reader discovers some major surprises. I won't say anything else because... no spoilers!Jeff VanderMeer's descriptive passages are beautiful, something that all three books shared: ""Soon after the storm, the trail they followed wound back to the sea along a slope of staggered hills running parallel to the water. The wet ground, the memory of those dark rivulets, made the newly seeded soil seem almost mirthful. Ahead lay the green outline of the island, illumined by the dark gold light of late afternoon."" pg 108.And Area X is as mysterious as ever: ""In the lengthening silence and solitude, Area X sometimes would reveal itself in unexpected ways."" pg 178. And also: ""Never has a setting been so able to live without the souls traversing it."" pg 241.I am glad that I took the time to read all three books. I think that VanderMeer's entire concept of Area X is brilliant.The series as a whole is strange but wonderful. Admittedly, the second book is the weakest and I barely made it through it. But, in hindsight, it fills in some blanks that contribute to the bigger picture.Recommended for readers who like their science fiction with a large side of horror/suspense.",64,2
18077752,Acceptance,Carmen,"2,045",1802,5,"March 29, 2016","NO SPOILERS. NO TE PREOCUPES.Bodies could be beacons, too, Saul knew. A lighthouse was a fixed beacon for a fixed purpose; a person was a moving one. But people still emanated light in their way, still shone across the miles as a warning, an invitation, or even just a static signal. People opened up so they became a brightness, or they went dark. They turned their light inward sometimes, so you couldn't see it, because they had no other choice.The final exploration of Area X. After the catastrophic and horrifying events that took place in Authority, this ragtag group of individuals is not really an expedition, but a patchwork mash-up of survivors trying to make sense of the feral, mysterious, blossoming explosion of nature called Area X.To recap: Area X is a large area of coast and swampland in Florida that is completely cut-off from humanity. Vines grow over everything, the ocean teams with fish, and the land is overflowing with an abundance of animals - some familiar, and some never seen before by human eyes. When the border went up, 30 years ago - 1,500 people died (or were never seen again and assumed dead) as they were consumed by this sudden apparition of wilderness. Now, the government has been sending in expeditions composed of teams of scientists in a desperate attempt to understand what's going on.Those expeditions have been massive failures. The teams either kill themselves, kill each other, disappear, or come back - as personality-less, hollow shells of their former selves. One notable expedition came back riddled with cancer - all of them died within 6 months of coming back.No one knows how anyone returns - they just appear, disoriented and confused....This book is, I believe, the weakest of the trilogy. Annihilation is the strongest. You can read Annihilation and enjoy it, love it, and never read the other two books. It can stand on its own two feet. But if you want answers (like I did) you will continue reading - because Annihilation sure leaves you with a lot of questions.That being said, I still think Acceptance deserves five stars. ...The writing is gorgeous.She had panicked for a second as the water pressed in on her, evoked her own drowning. But then something had turned on, or had come back, and raging against her own death, she had exulted in the sensation of the sea, welcomed having to fight her way to the surface - bursting through such a joyful hysteria of biomass - as a sort of proof that she was not ---, that she was some new thing that could, wanting to survive, cast out her fear of drowning belonging to another.--- = character's name x-ed out so no spoilersLook at this.  bursting through such a joyful hysteria of biomass. I mean, that is just exquisite. And the book is brimming with wonderful amazing sentences and paragraphs that you can get lost in.I read the book twice: I read it, and then turned to page 1 immediately to read it again. Half of this was because it was so beautiful, half of it was because there are a lot of complex things going on in this book that need a second reading to really coalesce in your mind....This book is a horror story. Not 'horror' as in Stephen King, buckets of blood and possessed cars and stuff. (Not dissing him, I'm a King fan - but it's a different kind of scary). Horror as in slow, creeping insanity, doppelgängers, hearing strange noises in the kitchen at night, etc. etc. etc. There's no villain, there's no tangible enemy of any kind. That's what makes it so frightening. Some of the stupider characters in the book just can't seem to grasp that you can't fight Area X with guns and bullets - in fact, you can't fight it at all. It's as pointless as raging against the ocean or the sky.Z had walked into the light to find Y staring at her with fear, with suspicion, and she had smiled at Y, had told her not to be afraid. Not to be afraid. Why be afraid of what you could not prevent? Did not want to prevent. Were they not evidence of survival? Were they not evidence of some kind? Both of them. There was nothing to warn anyone about. The world went on, even as it fell apart, changed irrevocably, became something strange and different.*Z and Y used in place of actual character names....It's also science-fiction. I've heard it described as ""cli-fi,"" as in science fiction with a slant on ""we're destroying our planet,"" a la Paolo Bacigalupi, but I hate this term. It makes a reader think that this is going to be preachy or self-righteous and that is not at all what this trilogy is like. It is fun, exciting, and edge-of-your-seat reading. I didn't find it the least bit sanctimonious. So read on with no fear! Except, perhaps, the fear that comes with reading any horror novel....Some of the reasons I think this is the weakest entry in the trilogy:We are in a lot of people's heads. Four different 'main characters' in this one, and we get all their points of view. Three in third-person and one in second-person (which is fun. I like second-person when it's done well). However, being involved in so many different POVs is adding a bit of complexity to an already very complex book. This is one reason I suggest reading it twice.Another thing is that the first half of the book is not that exciting, not that 'scary.' VanderMeer doesn't really start delivering the blows until page 193. From then on it's a faster-paced freefall into awesomeness, but you do have to get through that first half to reach this. IT'S WORTH IT. And the first half is not a slog - far from it. VanderMeer's writing is beautiful and you are also, by this point, familiar with - and curious about - the characters so that you are interested in seeing them and getting to know them better. But still, fair warning. Don't get fed up with the lack of 'action' and quit early....There's some great twists in here, and I was happy with the way everything turned up. Even though VanderMeer is not super-explicit, I feel like I have a pretty firm understanding of Area X and what it does after closing this book. People who need a very direct, pat explanation and everything spelled out for them ARE NOT going to be happy or satisfied with this trilogy. However, if you want an amazing trilogy with beautiful writing, fascinating and mysterious concepts, OMG-OMG-OMG horror that will have you riveted - this is the trilogy for you.You are still there for a moment, looking out over the sea toward the lighthouse and the beautiful awful brightness of the world.Before you are nowhere.Before you are everywhere.P.S. VanderMeer also - throughout the whole trilogy does a GREAT and AMAZING job of making characters of all different types: black, white, Latino, Asian, gay, hetero, bisexual - without making it seem glaring. He does this so seamlessly, so effortlessly, that the reader just falls into this. So many authors try to make ""diverse characters"" but end up drawing so much attention to their ""diverseness"" that it's distracting and annoying. ""Look at this character. He's Indian. He's eating chapati. Did I mention he's Indian? He says, ""Namaste"" in this one scene. BECAUSE HE'S INDIAN."" I hate this. Authors who do this are missing the whole entire point of making a 'diverse' cast of characters. The idea is not to hammer home how wonderful you are and how progressive you are for having non-white, or non-heterosexual characters - it's to make having non-white and non-heterosexual characters just a normal part of life. Not questioned, not commented upon to excess, not overanalyzed - just existing. VanderMeer pulls this off perfectly. So does Michael J. Martínez, whose The Daedalus Incident I also highly recommend.P.P.S. People closest to nature already tend to survive and even thrive in Area X, unlike people who are wrapped up in cities and humanity and bureaucracy and taking showers and stuff. LOL But seriously, this is why the biologist gets along so splendidly (comparatively) in Area X than the others.P.P.P.S. Strong women. If you enjoy strong women and female characters who are strong but NOT Mary-Sues, this is the trilogy for you. Multi-faceted, a mixture of goodness and malice, playing both the heroes of the piece and the villains, VanderMeer is wonderful in this regard.",55,8
18077752,Acceptance,Richard,224,7,2,"September 18, 2014","There's a paragraph or two in Acceptance that perfectly sums up my feelings about this trilogy(So much so that I had to look it up!). The key line is - ""The allure of the island lay in its negation of why"". The author is talking about how humans constantly need to have a purpose, constantly need to find the why behind something and neglect to just accept the `what` of something.Its so apt, because its exactly what happened to these books. Area X is summoned up in all its glory in the first book. Things just are - it feels like there is meaning behind it all, but its opaque and weird. Its fascinating!But then.... along plopped Authority and to a large degree Acceptance too. Both books don't expand on the amazing world building of Annihilation. Its all backstory. Dreary characters discovering pointless things about themselves and their co-workers/mothers/lighthouse keepers/past expedition members. All plot mechanics - all focused on the why and how rather than the what. Everyone's backstory explored to the point of pain.Maybe thats intentional, and largely its about humans ineffectiveness in the face of something so alien, but I found it the most tedious way to deal with this fascinating subject. There's occasionally a connection made that I think i'm supposed to see as a revelation (Lowry's identity, Controls mum, etc etc), but to me, it came off as cheap and totally perfunctory to the point of the book(the amazing bio-horror of Area X, the thing we cannot understand). Maybe it was just weighted too heavily towards the characters. I just never cared or clicked with any of them. And to be fair, Acceptance does have a handful of pages of great Area X stuff, but it was nowhere near enough in a 350 page book.Its possible I have entirely misunderstood what this is all about, so i'll be hungrily reading all your(mostly positive it seems!) reviews on here to try to discover what I missed.Also - the covers are among the most beautiful covers i've ever seen.",54,4
18077752,Acceptance,Caro the Helmet Lady,756,340,5,"July 15, 2017","Wow, this book. Wow, this series. I know it will haunt me for a while now and I will have to read something of completely different genre, because I will try and compare any other sci-fi or fantasy book to it through some period of time. And it will win. Because the language was gorgeous and the world was hypnotic and Biologist/Ghost Bird wormed in deep into my brain like that Saul's sliver of light. I guess this whole story had this effect on me. Acceptance was as good as Annihilation was, while it was different, more versatile. Seemingly less trippy, while even more trippy and crazy. It answered all questions and even those unanswered were OK as they remained unanswered. I never wanted books to give 100% explanations, it often only ruins the fun. This time the comparison with Solaris came to mind, in a good way of course. Would this sound as a blasphemy if I said this was in some way stronger than Solaris?Comparing to movies Beyond the Black Rainbow comes to mind, somehow.I feel like rereading the whole thing now to be honest. I can't process right now. Would love to discuss.",49,42
18077752,Acceptance,Emily B,419,411,2,"July 1, 2021","I didn’t get the answers I wanted from this book so it was pretty disappointing. I prefer when things are explained, specially after three books.

18077752,Acceptance,ren ♡ ,287,449,5,"December 19, 2022","Acceptance was an absolute fucking masterpiece. The Southern Reach series is definitely one of my favourite series of all time. The end had me sobbing. As with the first two, this book was beautifully written; the prose was too die for. I also loved the multiple POV's and how disjointed the narrative felt at times, it really added to the tension and nightmarish quality of the story. If I could write like VanderMeer, I'd quit my job and just write for a living. And I have to give credit where credit is due - VanderMeer writes amazing female characters, and ya'll know some male authors cannot write women for shit. I can definitely see why this series is so polarising though, there were so many questions left unanswered. I read a few reviews that claimed the whole book was a cop-out or a result of bad planning, but I whole-heartedly disagree. The Southern Reach series is about the journey and the questions we ask along the way, rather than the destination. If you're constantly looking for answers, you're going to miss out on so much amazing story telling. I also think having questions left answered is very much a reflection of the limits of humans when faced with the extraordinary... which is essentially what this story is about. What can we do when we face something that is ultimately unknowable? So, if you like clear-cut answers, this series is not going to be for you., but if you want to be mesmerized and you like weird fiction, this series will blow you away.(And for those of you who don't know, this was once a trilogy but VanderMeer did announce that there will be a fourth book! I am over the moon! I am not ready to let go of Southern Reach and Area X just yet.)Rating: 5/5",45,9
18077752,Acceptance,Andrea McDowell,556,301,5,"January 15, 2016","I have a hypothesis about this series. If you like boundaries between civilization and nature, humans and animals, intellect and emotion, you would probably classify these books as horror. And if you aren't particularly invested in those boundaries, you won't.I've read a number of reviews (both official and non) about these books that discuss how terrifying they are. But they're not. At least, not for me, and believe me, I've got a thin skin and a poor stomach for most horror. This was just life. An odd, alien, sometimes disturbing life, to be sure, but not particularly scary. At its foundation I think this series is ecological. The ""horror"" at its centre is just an elimination of the lines we draw between what is human and what is not. Civilization melts back into wilderness. Humans, after first becoming fascinated with the natural world, then become something Other. The kinship of people with other life forms on our planet is highlighted often. And the limitations of humanity, both in our character and in our reasoning ability, is made very clear. The character of the Biologist struck me as so true, and I've wanted to give Annihilation to the biologists I know to see what they make of her. Only she really copes well with Area X and its mysteries, and I don't think it's a coincidence that she's anti-social and already allied more closely with the natural world than with her fellow humans.So it's done. I loved the ending; I loved the way that the author chose his techniques so deliberately based on the books and the narrative. In this one, he switches between second and third, between past and present, between character viewpoints, in a way that is utterly effective and a marked contrast with the previous two. I love how atmospheric they are. I love the detailed and affectionate descriptions of the environment and the ecology, both within and outside of Area X. I loved the whole thing, and now once this year's reading challenge is over (curses), I have another trilogy to re-read from start to finish.",41,8

You could know the what of something forever and never discover the why....The only solution to the environment is neglect, which requires our collapse.
In my opinion, these are the most important quotes from this book as they explain the entire trilogy. Sometimes there just aren’t the kind of answers we’d like.In this third and last book of the Southern Reach trilogy we get three different POVs: the one of the lighthouse keeper, Saul Evans, beginning before the border came down and Area X was created; the one of the psychologist / director, Gloria, starting almost simultaneous to the one of the lighthouse keeper’s and then progressing to the events when/how she became director, until her death in Area X; the one of Control and Ghost Bird in what I would call present day Area X (sort of).We also get different POVs and timelines within these three POVs (such as the journal of the original biologist within the POV of Control and Ghost Bird). The book lets these different POVs converge and collide here.Some theories already hinted at in the previous books are confirmed, such as the fact that the border isn’t actually shutting Area X off, not completely; that it has a biological effect (like plants growing differently or faster) as much as a psychological influence on people (explaining the ineffectiveness of the research into the phenomenon, Lowry, and the general slowing down of any potentially effective counter-measures from humans).Thus, we get to know what Saul Evans was like before he became the Crawler, what made the psychologist so weird and yet kept her in her position at Southern Reach, the power plays at Southern Reach that damaged so much of the research, what happened to the biologist after the end of the first book, what qualified her for the expedition in the first place (no, it had nothing to do with her husband) and, yes, we get a pretty good picture of what happened that prompted the emergence of Area X with all its consequences. However, the author is too good and too sly to just hand us the resolution. Certain things remain mysterious but still palpable, giving us just enough to make a kind of sense of things, but leaving us with enough room for each and every reader to draw their own conclusion and take away what the individual needs.I do have to point out how much I like how the author included people of different ethnicities (Control being Latino, the director being of Native decent) and different sexual orientations and how it rides in the back, never shoving its way into the foreground, but being there, all normal, like it is supposed to be. It fleshes several characters out without being their sole definition and is the kind of characterization/writing that should be „normal“ in this day and age. Representation without making a big deal out of it. Effortless.My favorite POVs were that of the psychologist and Control / Ghost Bird although I don’t very much liked Control. He was like the boy with a toy gun, who had never really grown up, had never been allowed to fully grow up because that made him much more pliable for his mother, who received and followed orders and as soon as he didn’t have those anymore, didn’t have a mission - he just fell apart. Nevertheless, that POV, as well as the psychologist’s provided us with so many rich and vibrant descriptions of the area, even before it became Area X. The fauna, the flora, the ocean … the author once again sucking me into his rich descriptions of nature that made me feel right at home.The lighthouse keeper’s POV was brilliant, too, make no mistake. However, that one was more supposed to provide background and clicking certain pieces into place, while the other two - at least at first - were still about exploration and discovery.Things are much more connected than I first thought although I had had some slight suspicions. For example: It was already pretty clear to me that Lowry (the only survivor of the very first expedition) had been manipulating the missions into Area X from the beginning, but the phone having been his, intended for communication directly with Area X was as much a surprise as Control’s family’s connection to the emergence of Area X that also prompted their involvement right down to Control investigating Southern Reach. This also ties all three books to one another in a rather nice and natural way.It was fascinating how the author turned the original biologist into a kind of monster while the copy, Ghost Bird, was more human than her. Not that the biologist was ever a bad person per se, maybe not my type, but never meaning to harm (unlike, I think, Lowry). Nevertheless, Area X seemed to turn the „normal“ humans into the monsters that lurk underneath, emphasizing the point that we’re the actual danger (at least to nature), while the copies it spawned were living more peacefully in the „pristine wilderness“ that is Area X. A message in and of itself, especially considering how the author always tied it back to what we’re doing to our environment.And the sheer creativeness of what the humans are transformed into in Area X (the Crawler as much as what became the Moaner or, later, what the biologist had turned into) was simply a delight.There was one passage that resonated with me and yet I couldn’t agree with: 
  Perhaps so many journals had piled up in the lighthouse because on some level most came, in time, to recognize the futility of language. Not just in Area X but against the rightness of the lived-in moment, the instant of touch, of connection for which words were such a sorrowful disappointment, so inadequate an expression of both the finite and the infinite.
. A paradox, certainly, and yet this not only shows the depth of contemplation the author underwent and prompts the reader to undergo, an examination of what it is to be human (all facets), not to mention the beauty of the author’s prose, but it also is, in itself, the explanation because being human is a paradox. After all, we can be brilliant and kind and caring and indifferent and cruel and stupid - we can be the problem, but also the solution.Later, the book also defies the passage above by revealing that the Crawler’s words each create a world, meaning that language gives life and meaning.The trilogy mostly is about death and loss, obsession and, finally, acceptance.Thus, if it was nature’s way of fighting back, an alternate dimension pressing in after a rift had been created, perhaps even a biological weapon from some creature from another planet or alternate dimension, a remnant of an insanely advanced ancient civilization that no longer exists, a new universe being born … - we’ll never know for sure. My take is that it’s an alien intelligence’s version of a lab; a breach into our world. The Crawler’s words, everything that seeps into our world through Area X is the alien intelligence trying to make sense of us and our planet, our reality, trying to understand because it’s so different. After all, why should alien life be just like us? It’s highly unlikely that if there truly is other intelligent life „out there“, it will be like us. This isn’t Star Trek after all. Instead, it is much more likely that we wouldn’t comprehend it even if we came across it.It’s not really important either. Like I said, it’s up to the reader to fill in the blanks and let Area X grow and populate the imagination.Accept. Just accept.

  Area X was looking at her through dead eyes. Area X was analyzing her from all sides. It made her feel like an outline created by the regard bearing down on her, one that moved only because the regard moved with her, held her constituent atoms together in a coherent shape. And yet the eyes upon her felt familiar.
I'm not sure why none of these books have captured me like Annihilation. There was just something about those four nameless female scientists that held me rapt and it has not been repeated in the other titles.Vandermeer has conjured a beautifully lush yet deadly landscape, teeming with wildlife both real and imaginary. Unfortunately, the characters are not quite as full of life and frankly, they leave me cold. In this volume, I did enjoy the scenes shared by Gloria and Saul, the lighthouse keeper, but the others, even Ghost Bird and Control, bored me. There are a few moments of suspense and dread here, and questions are answered, but by that time I had stopped caring. If I knew then what I know now, I'd have stopped at the end of the first book.",37,11

The series was strange but also incredibly well-written and completely unique. I have to admit that I found Acceptance the weaker of the three books, with Annihilation being my favorite. I’d recommend this trilogy to science fiction fans or people wanting to read something that is different/original. ",34,2
