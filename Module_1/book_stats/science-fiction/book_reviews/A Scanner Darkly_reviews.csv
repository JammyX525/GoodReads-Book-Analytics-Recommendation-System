14817,A Scanner Darkly,Lyn,"1,845",16300,4,"March 19, 2019","A Scanner Darkly can be described as follows: begin with Hunter S. Thompson’s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, mix in a pinch of The Big Lebowski, a dollop of A Beautiful Mind, a scene from Crime and Punishment, the shadows and penumbra of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, whispered apprehension of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a hint of thirty year in advance anticipation of reality TV, stir in a portion of dystopian science fiction and mix it all together with Philip K. Dick’s weird genius. This is actually a very well written book; PKD delivers a mature, far from romantic glimpse of addiction and the drug sub-culture as only he could, a recovering, on again off again user himself and with mental illness added in. Still, this is a complete work by a talented writer and, minimalistic as it is, keeps the reader engaged. There is humor in the book, though it cannot be considered a comedy, perhaps a dark comedy as the subject matter, though painted with a mild sci-fi brush, is one of addiction and death. A reader of PKD’s works will notice the recurring theme here, as in several other works, of the idea of split personalities, of a protagonist coming to grips with multiple sides of his own ego. Another recurring theme, perhaps helped along by PKD’s own struggles with schizophrenia, is one of surveillance and, concurrently, helplessness while being watched. The pervasive paranoia and the multiple layers of theatrical irony are the elements of this story that will stay with the reader long after the book has been set down.",355,28
14817,A Scanner Darkly,Kemper,"1,388",6647,5,"January 22, 2012","I used to wonder how Phillip K. Dick came up with all the trippy concepts in his stories until I read A Scanner Darkly. That’s when I realized that the drugs probably had a lot to do with it.Originally published in 1977 and set in the mid ‘90s, the book tells the story of Bob Arctor. Arctor appears to be just another burned out druggie who lives with a couple of other dopers, and they spend most of their time getting high on Substance D and assorted other drugs. Bob is actually an undercover narc for the Orange County CA sheriff’s department, and in the future, the cops undercover are in so deep that even their bosses don’t know who they really are. Arctor wears a special scramble suit that blurs his features and voice when reporting to his boss Hank, who also wears a scramble suit to conceal his identity.Bob has been trying to buy bigger quantities of Substance D from Donna, a spacey hash addict, so that he can work his way to the source, but he’s actually fallen in love with her even though she refuses to sleep with him. He gets a tricky new assignment when Hank orders him to start keeping tabs on a new target; Bob Arctor. Since he can’t reveal his identity, Arctor has to play out the fiction that he’s investigating himself, but his brains have gotten so slushed from Substance D that he’s having a hard time keeping track of who he actually is.Bob’s increasing confusion about identity and reality is the kind of theme that Dick specialized in, and Bob’s progressive meltdown is some of my favorite writing he did regarding that. However, while this has a thin veneer of sci-fi over it with the story being set in what was the near future, it‘s actually a chillingly realistic look at drug abuse. Dick spent a couple of years in the early ’70s where he ran with the Just Say Yes! crowd, and this book is a semi-autobiographical account of that time. Where it really shines is in its portrayal of the drug culture with long sections dedicated to things like an addict who begins seeing bugs everywhere or a botched suicide attempt that turns into a psychedelic eternity of recrimination for past sins. The long rambling conversations with Bob and his fellow druggies are darkly hilarious in that they show a kind of weird creativity while also being completely devoid of logic and apt to go in paranoid directions. For example, a problem with a car eventually leads to their certainty that the cops have planted drugs in the house and that the only solution is to sell the place.Dick does a masterful job of showing how people could end up living in a perpetual haze while ignoring the long term damage being done even as they see their own friends die or get turned into little more than vegetables by their own behavior. As he puts it, their sin was in wanting to play all the time but the penalty was far harsher than they deserved. On a side note, I also loved the movie version of this done by Richard Linklater that featured a hand drawn rotoscope process over filmed scenes to give it a feeling of realistic unreality. Robert Downey Jr. and Woody Harrelson give great performances as Bob’s druggie housemates, and Keanu Reeves was born to play the brain fried Arctor. ",277,28
14817,A Scanner Darkly,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,3,"October 3, 2021","There are other books dealing with drug addiction that tell a whole story and not just the introspection of the protagonist balancing next to the cliffs on insanity by using Dicks´ stylistic trademarks consciousness, parallel realities, illusion, perception, madness,…Like most of Dicks´ novels, it is focused on one character and his mental problems, combined with the description of highs, illusions, and hallucinations with a sudden ending and many whats? and whys? while reading. It´s difficult to read, one gets a piece of information or disinformation, nothing is happening, then suddenly everything happens too quickly, it´s tricky to follow the whole thing and the end is so constructed, not pre implemented in the whole story and unlikely.The Sci-Fi element got completely lost in this one, except for some magic cloak style and I still remember how long I waited for the ending until it suddenly erupted and ended the novel far too early at a point where it could have unfolded instead. I added these paragraphs to my review of „Do Androids dream of electric sheep“ (still to come) too, because it fits for both novels. Just as „A scanner darkly“, the novel shows that Dick was a highly overrated and overhyped writer, I will spontaneously call him Kazuo Ishiguro of Sci-Fi, whose novels I disliked so much that I first didn´t even wanted to add them to the library. Wait a moment, one of my inner voices just told me that I did yet delete them for the sake of my peace of mind and mental sanity.I´ve read tons of sci-fi and just don´t get what people see in Dick and Heinlein, it´s not even social sci-fi because everything is so stereotypical, or illogical, full of authors' voice, both unplotted and without realistic character motivations. Just as if they wrote down whatever came to their mind without caring about the conventions and rules of the art of writing real, great, worldbuilding space opera sci fi, or meta social sci fi or full dystopian sci fi, or anything that has more than 2 grains of sci-fi trope elements, and not just egocentric, eccentric, very average novels with tiny amounts of fantastic elements and much drivel and delusion.The 2 strange weirdo uncles problem:They are, especially in comparison to the true big three of sci-fi, Asimov (incredible worldbuilding, wit, innuendos, and connotations en masse, perfect pacing) Clarke ( über epic language, a positive interpretation of Lovecrafts´ big, dangerous old ones, subtle social criticism), and Lem (everything great about Asimov and Clarke conmpressed and so complex that it blows my poor, little mind whenever I reread it)the 2 strange uncles of the genre nobody wants to invite, but has to, because it would be too unfriendly and the aunt is quite ok at least. So the one is wasted, drunk or on drugs, mentally ill or extremely unstable, promoting pseudo fringe philosophical drivel about conscience and reality, conspiracy theories, alternate realities, and timelines, uchronias while he is losing the red line and inner logic of his strange ideas until he finishes with an extremely unsatisfying and far fetched conclusion nobody except of him understands. The other one is arbitrarily and unpredictably switching between extreme political and economic ideologies and ideas he is hardlinering and proselytizing about, while his views about women, gays, and sexuality are insulting half of the family, until he finishes his endless monologues without referring to any details, facts, or integrating complex interwoven character arcs. Family gatherings suck.Tropes show how literature is conceptualized and created and which mixture of elements makes works and genres unique: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...",244,14
14817,A Scanner Darkly,Glenn Russell,"1,325",11600,5,"April 2, 2020","“I have seen myself backward.”― Philip K. Dick, A Scanner DarklyA Scanner Darkly - Philip K. Dick's searing, hyperrealist tale of a specific time (late 1960s), a specific place (California), and a specific mentality (seek maximum happiness now since tomorrow you might die) set in 1994, enough in the near future for the author to inject massive doses of his signature wild imagination into the mix. As most readers will know, director Richard Linklater employed distinctive digital technology and animation in creating a blockbuster film based on the novel.  In his Author's Note to A Scanner Darkly, PKD lists fifteen of the people he loved who lost life or sanity during those outrageous years. He also reveals something extremely personal to his readers: he is not in the novel, he is the novel. Intrigued? You should be. Here are ten hits of what this unique, drug-centered classic is all about:1. Freak-Out: The opening scene features doper Jerry Fabin in a frantic battle with thousands of aphid bugs infesting his hair and every inch of his body. Unfortunately, Jerry is fighting a losing battle - even standing under hot water in the shower ten hours a day doesn't help. After suffering one particularly severe attack, Jerry admits defeat and is admitted into Number Three Federal Clinic. The psychic meltdown of Jerry Fabin is a haunting reminder to all of Jerry's friends of what can happen with too much dope, a reminder coating every page of the novel like a thick syrup. 2. Drugs and More Drugs: In addition to hash, heroin, cocaine, mescaline, LSD, speed and other familiar names on the list, there is the new prima numero uno drug of choice, Substance D aka Death or Slow Death. Among its many side effects is the risk of split brain phenomenon, where a user will develop two identities and have one side of their brain talk to the other as if two different people in conversation. And cut with bad ingredients, in a matter of months, Substance D can cause a sixteen year old girl to look like a scraggly old lady with grey hair falling out. But the supercharged high produced outweighs the possible side effects by far. Oh, wow!3. The Setting: Sprawling air-conditioned Southern California nightmare, an unending repetition of McDonald hamburger stands, strip malls, gas stations and freeways. Main character Robert Arctor reflects: ""They (McDonald's) had by now, according to their sign, sold the same original burger fifty billion times. He wondered if it was to the same person. Life in Anaheim, California, was a commercial for itself, endlessly replayed. Nothing changed; it just spread out father in the form of neon ooze."" 4. War: It's straights vs. dopers since the dopers can't stomach the air conditioned nightmare and just want to turn on and drop out but the straights think all the neon ooze is as American as grandma and apple pie. And those straights include fully armed Birchers and Minutemen, city police and federal police, army forces and unidentified forces. If you are a doper and caught off guard, you will quickly be eliminated via jail or bullet or even worse, a federal clinic. In this war, the straights don't take any prisoners since, for them, dopers are disgusting filth, not even on the level of mangy dogs.5. Scramble Suits: An underground cop will report gathered information wearing a futuristic scramble suit, a full body, head to toe covering, a piece of technological magic, rendering the wearer a vague blur. The police chief receiving this information will also wear a scramble suit. Thus concealment and secrecy are maintained on all levels. 6. Surveillance: In this futuristic world the police possess powerful technology to spy on dopers in all sorts of ways, including scanners that can zoom in and out in 3-D. Feeling paranoid? There might be good reason - smile, you are on candid camera. 7. Robert Arctor, One: Bob was once a straight, living with his wife and two little girls out in their three bedroom house, working as an investigator for an insurance company, but one day Bob hit his head in the kitchen and all instantly came clear in a flash: his entire life was a sham, nothing but a deadly routine and he hated all of it. Soon thereafter Bob gets a divorce and shifts into the doper life.8. Robert Arctor, Two: To support his drug habit and live in his now rundown doper house, Bob takes on the job of undercover narcotics agent. The drug world, Arctor recognizes, is a murky world were dopers work for the cops and cops posing as dopers get hooked on dope and might even become full-time dealers. And Robert Arctor gets hooked on a bunch of dope, most notably on Substance D. Arctor escaped his drab, humdrum, straight family life but can he be sure his new doper life will turn out to be any better? 9 Robert Arctor, Three: Bob reports to his boss Hank in his scramble suit where he assumes name and identity as Frank. But, then, Bob has to deal with the crazy effects of Substance D causing his personality and identity to split in two. Oh, my spacey hallucinations! - an undercover agent living two lives with two different names experiencing split brain phenomenon. A custom-made phenomenon for the one and only PKD. 10. Dopers Friends: We are provided detailed glimpses into the inner and social lives of the two doper dudes living at Bob's house: supercool Ernie Luckman and supersmart Jim Barris. There is also Arctor's heartthrob - young, superfoxy Donna Hawthorne. Hey, wait a toker minute. Is Luckman or Barris or Donna what they appear to be? How many of them are also living a double life? As noted above, the drug world is a murky world. And that includes government agencies more than happy to slide into a sinister double life to achieve their goals. Read all about it. Remember PKD IS this novel. What a trip.“The tragedy in his life already existed. To love an atmospheric spirit. That was the real sorrow. Hopelessness itself. Nowhere on the printed page, nowhere in the annals of man, would her name appear: no local habitation, no name. There are girls like that, he thought, and those you love most, the ones where there is no hope because it has eluded you at the very moment you close your hands around it.” ― Philip K. Dick, A Scanner Darkly",225,31
14817,A Scanner Darkly,Warwick,809,14400,5,"January 4, 2019","In 1971, Philip K Dick's fourth wife, Nancy, left him and took their little daughter with her. Dick was left alone in a four-bedroom house in Santa Venetia, ‘in a state of complete desolation and despair, and suicidally depressed’, as he later put it. In an attempt to surround himself with life and activity, he turned the property into a kind of open house for what he called ‘street people’ – drug-users that he knew through his amphetamine habit, although many of them were on much harder drugs than he was.Dick's new housemates stopped him from killing himself, but a lot of them weren't so lucky themselves. ‘Toward the start of 1972,’ he remembered, ‘I woke up one day and noticed that all my friends either were dead, had burned-out brains, were psychotic, or all of the above.’ And these were people he had become very close to; indeed he thought he was in love with one of them.This was the genesis of A Scanner Darkly, in which Dick, grounding his metaphysical speculations in the real environment of the California doper scene, finally produced an out-and-out masterpiece. The novel's motivation is hinted at when its protagonist looks around at the drug addicts and drop-outs around him:In wretched little lives like that, someone must intervene. Or at least mark their sad comings and goings. Mark and if possible permanently record, so they'll be remembered. For a better day, later on, when people will understand.This is the colossal impulse of sympathy animating the book. Though it's obviously and openly about the California of the late 60s, Scanner is set, by genre convention, in the then-future of 1994, a distancing technique that Dick uses merely to blow up contemporary issues. Characters still use 60s slang, quote Timothy Leary, watch Easy Rider and listen to Hendrix and Janis Joplin on cassette; but they do it in a society where 60s paranoia about a ‘police state’ has been realised, where surveillance technology is advanced and all-pervasive, and where anyone, even your best friend, could be a narc in disguise.Our main character is one of them. As Agent Fred, he is responsible for infiltrating and monitoring a house full of drug addicts, using hand-wavy technology which means that no one, even his superiors, knows what he really looks or sounds like. His bosses tell him to focus on one guy in particular, Bob Arctor, not realising that Bob Arctor is Fred himself.The problem is that Fred/Bob is taking a lot of drugs in the line of duty, and he starts to become unsure of his real identity. As Bob, wandering about his house, he frets paranoically about the possibility of surveillance equipment in the walls; as Fred, he studies the tapes of Bob's activity and wonders who this guy is and what he's hiding. As the book goes on, the two increasingly fracture into separate entities.What's great about this is that Dick has always been fascinated by identity crisis and ontological instability; but whereas in previous books these are generated by sci-fi magic, here they are all rooted in a real evaluation of what drug addiction does to the human brain. Indeed he saw A Scanner Darkly as being, essentially, his great anti-drug novel, telling friends he wanted it to do for hard drugs what All Quiet on the Western Front did for war.I don't see it working quite that way; to me its genius is not located in its moral message, which is anyway not as strong or unambiguous as I think Dick thought it was. Unlike most of his other novels, it's also very funny. There is a great ear for dialogue in this book, with whole conversations reproduced very naturally – you feel like you're eavesdropping on these people as they crack jokes, talk bullshit, get confused, freak out, get high and negotiate relationships.“You want a ride where you're going?”“You'll bang me in the car.”“No,” he said, “I can't get it on right now, these last couple of weeks. It must be something they're adulterating all the stuff with. Some chemical.”“That's a neat-o line, but I've heard it before. Everybody bangs me.” She amended that. “Tries to, anyhow. That's what it's like to be a chick. I'm suing one guy in court right now, for molestation and assault. We're asking punitive damages in excess of forty thousand.”“How far'd he get?”Donna said, “Got his hand around my boob.”“That isn't worth forty thousand.”Scanner is full of great scenes, many of which can make you feel acute sadness and laughter all at the same time. It's also one of the best portraits of this milieu that I've read, and holds its own alongside other products of the 60s US counterculture – The Crying of Lot 49, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. In some ways the patina of science-fiction means it does a better job of explaining it all than any of them.And as the title warns you, it's not an upbeat tale. It spirals into a dark place, and then leaves you there. In a heartbreaking Afterword, Dick lists the friends he knew at that time and records the damage that was done to them. One of the names is his own. Most of the others simply say ‘deceased’.We really all were very happy for a while, sitting around not toiling but just bullshitting and playing, but it was for such a terribly brief time, and then the punishment was beyond belief; even when we could see it, we could not believe it. […] These were comrades whom I had; there are no better. They remain in my mind, and the enemy will never be forgiven.‘You won't believe how screwed-up reality is actually, John, until you read SCANNER,’ Dick wrote to a friend; ‘I had no idea myself.’ You can feel that shock reverberating through the novel, alongside his curiosity, his sympathy, his horror. It's like all his gifts and obsessions finally had something real through which to be refracted – and the results may be dark, but they're also brilliant.",161,39
14817,A Scanner Darkly,carol.,"1,501",7547,3,"November 24, 2020","I've started and restarted this review a number of times. With that in mind, I'm going to take a page from mark monday (http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13...) and share a multi-perspective review.The .gif summation:Recipe for A Scanner Darkly:1. Take moderate amounts of the drug of your choice (recommend one with highly hallucinogenic and paranoiac qualities)2. Allow to simmer while reading Less Than Zero3. Stir in a random amount of a second drug (preferably one with potential for permanent brain damage--current versions of the recipe recommend bath salts)4. Allow to cook in brain pan on high heat5. Watch Rush, the movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102820/6. Rinse and repeat until brain fully cookedThe literary critic:Wandering, borderline incoherent narrative. Half-hearted attempt to tack on conspiracy theory at the end, which might have been effective had there been more building earlier. The story did surprise me in a couple of places, notably Luckman's unintentional drug trip which, while genius, does miss the consequence point he seems to want to make; and in the plot twist at the very end. Like the main character, Bob Arctor/Fred, PKD seems of two minds about the book: does he want to tell a story of extreme consequences to deliberate recreational drug use, or does he want to tell a mystery noir, with undercover agents, spying, illegal drug running, and conspiracies?That said, character creation was brilliant. Each has his own way of interacting with drugs, his own purpose and own experience, and the intersections were fascinating. Barris with his experimental genius. Luckman with his pursuit of pleasure, Donna with her strangely drawn and arbitrary drug-use lines (ha-ha), and Charles Freck with his sad effort to self-medicate mental illness. I'm sure several of the conversations came out of real life; they are too absurd not to. The psychological evaluation sections were interesting, and a clever device to give the reader insight into the world and Arctor, although the mumbo-science passed through my own tired brain. Stylistically, the language was essentially prosaic, but occasionally a phrase would catch my attention and stop me in my tracks with meaning:""It will be a hindsight I won't even get to have. Somebody else will have to have it for me.""""And then he thought, Strange how paranoia can link up with reality now and then, briefly. Under very specialized conditions, such as today.""The personal:Been there, done that. I get PKD and his motivations, I really do. His Author's Note was quite powerful, especially when he says ""these people wanted to keep having a good time forever."" Except it his book skipped the good time, the gentle slide into drug dependency, the slip of control from choosing to needing, personal charm eroded into manipulation. Had he done so, my sympathy for the characters would have been greater and my connection to the story deeper. I would have enjoyed it more if there had been more than the tiniest shred of redemption, some elements of joy and abandon to show the sheer delight of the ""children playing in the street.""

14817,A Scanner Darkly,Darwin8u,"1,559",8647,5,"March 5, 2017","Be happy NOW, for tomorrow I will be writing. Take the cash and let the credit GOI'll write MY review tomorrow. Let US all be happy. And play AGAIN.ToMORROW.****So, I wrote a review I was really proud of today during lunch. Four or five paragraphs. I liked it a lot. So, I was rather disheartened when my computer froze and I had to do a hard-boot to unfreeze it. Lost everything but the vague outlines of what I wrote. Even those vague outlines seem difficult to grasp right now. I'm kinda demoralized. Alas, I can probably make some bridge to how THIS loss (MY loss) of data...this unrecoverable review...this remorse over the ebbs of life dovetails quite nicely with some of the themes of A Scanner Darkly. But right now I just don't care. I'm still pissed about the loss and have a hard time seeing through the glass at all.****So, I'm going to give review resurrection a shot: 'A Scanner Darkly' fits well on the addiction/drug/alcoholism as literature shelf. It needs no subsidy to sit next to Infinite Jest, Tender Is the Night, Under the Volcano, Less Than Zero, Naked Lunch, On the Road and the rest. This list is basically unending.It seems like all novels about drug abuse, alcohol addiction, etc.., almost inevitably become a form of science fiction. They surf those disjointed, dream-like spaces -- seducing man from the first time he got buzzed from eating, drinking, or smoking something deliriant. These dope trips aren't rational, they aren't lucid, etc., but they still have a certain narrative coherence. It is like science fiction was created (in the beginning) by some belladonna-infused deity and formed into a perfect literary template to explain/capture all the paranoia and weirdness of the trips highs and lows.It is impossible to read a novel about addiction without recognizing the author's fingerprints all over it. These novels are all memoirs of sorts. Their pages hold more truth than the Library of Congress. They are funky road trips through hell and PKD is the perfect acid artist for this vicious trip.****As I read 'A Scanner Darkly', I was haunted by the open wounds in the dialogue, the festering beauty of his prose. These weren't scenes created ex nihilo. These pages all resonate like some haunted Totentanz. They chill like a Vanitas dream you can't quite escape. I can't remember what I wrote. The words, the melody, even the beat of what was once alive is now dead... and waiting for a trippy resurrection.",89,7
14817,A Scanner Darkly,"Vicky ""phenkos""",144,92,5,"September 1, 2020","Philip K. Dick's work has had a tremendous influence on me. Although I don't read much sci-fi these days, any time I go back to one of Dick's books, I feel as if I retreat into an enclosed space deep inside me - a space that I recognise and cherish, yet sometimes lose or forget. Finding oneself - losing onself...A Scanner Darkly is probably not the best known of Dick's works. It lacks the brilliance of Do Androids or the depressive atmosphere of Three Stigmata. Yet, it offers a sneak peek in Dick's psyche, partly because of the subject matter and partly because of a postface where Dick explains why he wrote the book. A Scanner Darkly has some autobiographical elements; Dick wrote it after he broke up with his wife Nancy and was left to live on his own in a three-bedroom house which he soon filled with a rotating coterie of drug-using friends and acquaintances. It is his own and his friends' mental deterioration during this period that Dick documents in his book. Of course, in true Dickian style, this account is never realistic or sociological; Dick never moralises or regrets his choices. But at the end of the book, a deep pain makes itself felt - a pain that engulfs the reader and shows something of what life must have been like for Dick at the time.As the blurb says, the book is about the effects of Substance D or 'slow death', a toxic drug that causes severe brain damage to its users. Bob Arctor, the main character of the book, is addicted to Substance D, as are several of his friends and house-mates. Unbeknownst to them, however, Arctor is also an undercover narcotics agent who tries to identify drug dealers in a bid to stem the flow of the drug in the US. This character has a dual identity; known as Arctor to his friends and his dealing girlfriend, he is known as Fred to his superiors. In addition, when he works as an agent, Arctor/Fred wears a suit which scrambles his facial and bodily features so that anyone who sees him in his suit cannot form a clear impresion of him. Thus, the suit makes him unidentificable to the police and anyone he comes into contact with. This sounds like a super-weapon but it has a side-effect whose sinister importance becomes clearer as the plot thickens. The suit protects Arctor from exposing his own addction to his superiors, however, it also means that to protect his identity he has to report on his own self as well as his mates and the dealers he chases. His superiors know, of course, that in order to infiltrate the drug-dealing underworld Fred has to pretend he is a drug user (and perhaps more than ""pretend""). It is, therefore, common knolwedge that one of the people Fred reports on will be himself, however this is accepted as necessary in the course of his duties. The problem is that under the influence of Substance D, which causes the two hemispheres of the brain to stop syncronising their operation, Arctor/Fred loses any sense of who he is. Fred watches Arctor through the scanners installed in his home for surveillance but gradually fails to register that he is himself Arctor. The split in the two hemispheres of his brain becomes a split into who he is, with the result that he is no longer able to even recall his name. In the postface, Dick dedicates the book to those of his friends who died or suffered irreparable damage from drug-taking. Yet, he does not blame them. Instead, he says they paid a very heavy price for what they did, which was go against the prevailing mores of the time. These people, he says, wanted to ""play"" instead of toiling, but were punished disproportionately for this. There is no moral in this novel; it is not bourgeois; it does not say they were wrong to play when they should have toiled; it just tells what the consequences were. In Greek drama they were beginning, as a society, to discover science, which means causal law. Here in this novel there is Nemesis: not fate, because any one of us could have chosen to stop playing in the street, but, as Inarrate from the deepest part of my life and heart, a dreadful Nemesis for those who kept on playing. There is no redemption in this novel. All there is is a list of names. ""These were comrades whom I had; there are no better. They remain in my mind, and the enemy will never be forgiven."" But the ""enemy"" was not the narcotics agency, the state, the underworld of dealers or the drug itself. The ""enemy"", says Dick, ""was their mistake in playing. Let them all play again, in some other way, and let them be happy."" Towards the end of the book, other undercover agents reveal that Substance D is not some synthetic drug made in a lab like heroin but an organic flower called mors ontologica. Ontological death. Connecting this with what Dick says in the postface, I believe he wants to impress on us that the people he talks about in his novel, his comrades who wanted to ""play"", did not simply make a mistake which could have been avoided if the supply lines of the drug were disrupted. Instead, these people were ontologically different from the others, the ""straights"", those who live their lives as they're supposed to. Fred himself was a ""straight"" who could not bear his life any longer. One day, he knocked his head against a shelf and it just hit him; he abandoned his wife and two daughters and went to live far away. Dick's desire for a more authentic life, his own desire to ""play"", as well as his mysticism, becomes apparent here. Let us recall that the phrase ""a glass darkly"" derives from St. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians. What Fred sees when he watches Arctor and his drug-taking friends through the surveillance scanners is not naked ""reality"" but something else. Whether it is possible to see things clearly, though, outside the distorting effect of the scanner, is completely uncertain...",69,6

Sutton,651,825,4,"March 27, 2020","We are exchanging too much passive life for the reality outside us.There were a couple of times when I felt that A Scanner Darkly, a story about an undercover narc agent who narcs on himself before being sent to rehab, should have been one of PK Dick's short stories. However, just when I thought PKD had played out his hand, the scene would change and we would return to one of Dick's central tenets in a new way: how do we know what is real. That is followed by characters trying both to figure out their (twisted) reality and who they are (or might be). PKD makes sure it's never an easy call. A Scanner Darkly got better as it continued and kept pushing the boundaries of reality and identity. Finally, the epilogue to A Scanner Darkly is more moving than I remember an epilogue ever being.

Truthfully, I like the challenge. Love the ideas. The guy was brilliant. But let me tell you, some of the situations and conversations I experienced in this book could possibly be the wildest I’ve come across – since reading my last Dick novel. In an epilogue, he offers his reason for writing A Scanner Darkly. It is poignant to say the least. He adds that there is no moral to his story. With drugs, there are only consequences. He tells this from personal experience. “I am not a character in the novel. I am the novel.” Maybe no moral, but definitely a message: Drugs take no prisoners. Fittingly, he named the drug in this book “Substance D” - death for short.",54,15
14817,A Scanner Darkly,Apatt,507,751,4,"November 5, 2015","My favorite PKD books tend to be those published in the 60s when he was writing wacky fun reality warping sci-fi like Ubik, The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep etc. Of his 70s books that I have read Flow My Tears the Policeman Said is my favorite, whereas VALIS I could not (as yet) finish. I think the later PKD novels tend to be more serious and introspective though the weirdness is always present.A Scanner Darkly is one of his early 70s books and I find it more grounded than his earlier books, less insane and a little less fun to read. It is also semi-autobiographical and more melancholy than his other books that I have read. Set in the “near future” of 1992 (it was the future at the time) in a grubby, dystopian California where the general standard of living appears to be very poor and drug addicts possibly outnumber the non-addicts. The novel is mostly centered on Bob Arctor, an undercover narcotics officer who lives among three addicts in a rented house and has a girlfriend who is a small time pusher. Bob’s cover is of course as another addict and his mission is basically to glean enough info form his junkie friends and his girlfriend to locate and arrest the producers of a powerful and popular drug called “Substance D”. The trouble is Bob is too deep under cover and has become an addict himself, consuming copious amount of this drug which messes up his head to the extent that he begins to have an identity crisis and lose his capacity for clear thoughts. As a police agent, Bob goes under the name Fred and always wear a “Scramble Suit” which prevent people from remembering his appearance so his true identity is known only to himself. This novel reads more like a thriller or drama about drug abuse than science fiction. The sci-fi elements like the scrambled suit and holographic photos seem to have been shoehorn in to make the novel legitimately sci-fi, because for some reason Dick did not want the book published as a “mainstream” book, possibly because sci-fi is his comfort zone or to avoid alienating his regular readers (just my conjecture).Fans of PKD’s weird goings-on will find enough to please themselves here I think. There are even some hilarious moments in the book such as the bizarre story of a motorized man-shaped block of hash told by one of the junkies.Dick is often criticized for writing inelegant prose, I never notice this myself as I have always liked his uncluttered prose, the right tool for the right job of telling his bizarre stories. Flowery or lyrical narrative style seems to be very unsuitable for his material. That said A Scanner Darkly seems to be more well written than his books from the 60s; on the other hand there is much more swearing in this book than I can remember from his earlier books. There is also a little bit of romance, considerable compassion, kindness, and sadness. Elements I do not usually associate with PKD’s works. The saddest part of the book is actually the author’s Afterward at the end of the book.I would recommend reading this novel then watch the 2006 faithful movie adaptation for maximum appreciation. Not my favorite PKD as there are dull patches here and there but overall a very worthwhile read and one of his more “important” novels.And now a mini-review of A Scanner Darkly, 2006 movieIt is a good movie with a unique look and good performances by the actors. However, I wish the filmmaker Richard Linklater has shot the movie conventionally instead of employing the ""interpolated rotoscope"" technology to make the movie look like animation. On the plus side, the movie does look suitably surreal, like junkie's drug addled perspective. Unfortunately, the animated look puts an additional layer between the actors and the audience and causes an emotional disconnection. ",53,6

Good thing I didn’t tell myself I’d lose weight! The one thing I have always told myself is I need to read a Philip K. Dick story. Imagine my surprise when I cued this one up on the ol’ Fiat’s Bluetooth and heard that it was written by Philip K. Dick. I’m not sure one book can be a quantifier for his entire set of works, but in the immortal words of Larry David, this was . . . . . 
  
Whoops. I mean . . . . 
  
Since I listened to it, I don’t have any quotes to provide. I can tell you the story is sort of a “scared straight” type of tale – all about the perils of drug addiction. Our MC, Bob Arctor, is a small-time dealer looking to go big with the new drug of choice known as Substance D. He’s also an undercover agent known as Fred who is trying to bust a small-time dealer looking to go big known as Bob Arctor. Nope, you didn’t read that wrong. You see, one of the side effects of Substance D is that it causes your mind to break from reality. Bob is Bob when he is Bob, but thanks to Bob imbibing in some of his own wares he is also Fred trying to bust Bob when he is Fred. There’s a bevy of supporting characters that make this story more than worth the price of admission added in for good measure. Classified as “Sci-Fi” – a genre I don’t typically steer myself toward – would probably have been the right classification back in 1977 when A Scanner Darkly was originally published. Today? It’s pretty freaking realistic. Aside from the scanner suit, it’s like Philip K. Dick was a real soothsayer with regard to the future of drug use in America.4 solid stars thanks, in part, to Paul Giamatti on the audio . . . . .
  
Not interested in reading or listening to the book? Good news! There’s a real trippy film version that’s like live action with a cartoon overlay (wayback machine has teenie bopper Kelly saying just like the A-Ha video!) starring Keanu Reeves . . . . 
  
And an all-star supporting cast . . . .

14817,A Scanner Darkly,Stuart,700,259,4,"November 28, 2015","The weird and trippy 1970s drug scene in California ala PKDOriginally posted at Fantasy LiteratureIf you were choosing any Hollywood actor to narrate an audiobook of PKD about dope users in Southern California in the early 1970s, who would you choose? Random House Audio got Paul Giamatti to read A Scanner Darkly, and who could better? I tried to distill the vibe of the book in the following passage I assembled on my own. Imagine him reading it if you will:Hey man, it’s not easy for a doper trying to score and get high in a world of chickenshit straights with their dead-end jobs, not to mention narcs trying to bust you. You’d rather light up with some mellow heads and foxy chicks dropping tabs, grooving to acid rock, talking about random shit endlessly, and rolling joints. Once you flash onto this, man, and roll a fantasy number in your head, you’ll be fine unless you run into some psychotic paranoids with a grudge out to kill your buzz. Or even worse, you might get hooked on Substance D and your two brain hemispheres might split into Bob Arctor, doper extraordinaire, and Phil, undercover DEA agent. Things get even more messed up when you do surveillance on…yourself. It’s enough to drag even the most hip cat down.A Scanner Darkly is a deeply personal fictional depiction of PKD’s early 1970s living in Marin County (setting changed to Southern California in the book) with a bunch of stoners in a big house after his fourth wife Nancy left him. There are moments of hilarity (mainly centered on two crazy housemates named Barris and Luckman, played brilliantly by Robert Downey Jr. and Woody Harrelson in the Richard Linklater film version), tragedy, pure horror, and then long stretches where stoners just ramble on about random stuff. Bob Arctor is a minor drug dealer and user living in Anaheim with a few other dopers who spend their days trying to score dope, hash, mushrooms, and other chemical substances. Most don’t seem to have any gainful employment except Bob’s friend Donna, who is a dealer of psychedelic drug Substance D, aka Death. But unknown to them, Bob is also Fred, an undercover DEA agent assigned to spy on the house and track down the suppliers of Substance D. The problem is, the drug also causes the two hemispheres of the brain to bifurcate until the user has two separate personalities that are unaware of each other. And since all narcs use scramble suits to disguise their identities, the DEA doesn’t know that Fred is also Bob Arctor. Bob himself doesn’t recognize the situation, but suspects something is strange.Eventually Phil’s surveillance collapses after watching hours of himself and his roommates. His handlers discover his drug addiction and send him to the New Path rehab facility for drug addicts, but this is also loosely based on some real-life experiences of PKD. The story suddenly turns into One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest as Bob becomes a brain-fried mental patient trapped in the facility, and an elaborate conspiracy is revealed, but this feels forced and not consistent with the main story of Bob Arctor and his stoner friends living their self-destructive, carefree and tragic lives.Since this is so autobiographical, you might wonder why it needs to be SF. In fact, PDK felt it would be hard to market it as a mainstream novel, so his editor at Ballantine Books helped him add SF elements, particularly the scramble suits that are integral to preserving the deception of Bob/Phil’s split personas. Of note, the inspiration for the scramble suits is explained as an accidental discovery by an employee of Bell Laboratories that was experimenting with “disinhibiting substances” and experienced “a disastrous drop in the GABA fluid of his brain”. This caused him to see an ultra-rapid series of modern abstract paintings from a Leningrad art museum projected on the wall of his bedroom via “lurid phosphene activity”. This is actually a real hallucination that PKD experienced in 1974 as part of his religious interactions with VALIS. But I digress.The language is pure 1970s hippie/stoner/counterculture slang, and the world he depicts is pretty close to what I imagine 1970s Southern California was like. And herein lies a problem. If you’ve never been a part of this subculture, these stoner conversations are just as ridiculous as the real versions they were based on. And while literature exposes readers to all kinds of unfamiliar worlds, this one can get fairly tedious at times. The junkie mentality is perfectly depicted in its total fixation on getting the next fix at any cost, and there is no hesitation to steal, betray, or even stand by idly as your other junkie friends choke on a piece of food, die from overdoses, or go through painful withdrawals. But for us straights who aren’t hip to the stoner life, you may have trouble feeling sympathy.In fact, the most powerful message is the afterword dedicated to all PKD’s friends who have suffered from their drug use, resulting in “death, permanent psychosis, and brain damage.” As he states clearly, “""some people were punished entirely too much for what they did,"" and ""drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to move out in front of a moving car."" This was rampant in the 1960s and 1970s and sadly still persists to this day, as depicted in drama series like The Wire and Breaking Bad. The 2006 movie version is directed by Richard Linklater, an indie filmmaker from Austin, Texas. It stars Keanu Reeves (Bob Arctor/Fred), Woody Harrelson (Ernie Luckman), Robert Downey Jr. (James Barris), and Winona Rider (Donna Hawthorne). It is done in digital Rotoscope, a process which animates live-action film footage, creating a unique look to the film (the earlier non-digital rotoscoping technique was used for A-ha’s classic 1985 video “Take on Me”, Ralph Bakshi’s Lord of the Rings and Wizards, and parts of 1982’s Heavy Metal. Considering the mind-altered states of the characters in the film, it is the perfect visual medium to depict their slippery grasp of reality. It makes each scene fresh and interesting to look at, and yet all the actors are unmistakably themselves. The casting of Harrelson and Downey are absolutely spot-on as Bob’s totally paranoid and ridiculous junkie roommates, and the bug-eyed looks and uncontrolled body ticks of Rory Cochrane (Charles Freck) are hilarious and scary.Having read the book before watching the film, I felt like all of the best scenes of the book were picked up for the film while the some overlong stoned conversations ended up on the cutting room floor. My favorite scenes in the book were done to perfection, like Freck getting pulled over, the discovery of the still-lit joint, the stolen mountain bike, the home-made silencer, and the clowning around of Luckman and Barris were brilliantly captured by Downey and Harrelson (I wonder, did PKD write the parts just for them, seeing into the future?). The screenplay (also by Richard Linklater) also interspersed more hints of the New Path rehab clinic earlier in the film to make the final part of the film more cohesive than in the book. It also made a crucial change in the real identity of one of the main characters (no spoiler from me, don’t worry), which made the ending more believable perhaps. And Keanu Reeves? Well, most people lambaste him for his wooden, emotionless delivery, but who better to play a conflicted, schizophrenic undercover cop and heavy drug user. He is perfect in the role. Another important decision was to modernize the language so it doesn’t sound like 1970s hippie slang, and still preserve the tone and intent of the author. I even think I detected the distinctive red stripe of a Costco superstore when they were driving along the highway. Far out, dude.",49,8
