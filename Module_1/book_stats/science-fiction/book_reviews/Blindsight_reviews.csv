48484,Blindsight,carol.,"1,501",7547,5,"March 26, 2021","This is a very dense book, packed with ideas. Although Watts mentions he's a biologist by training, you wouldn't know it: between all the astronomical events, the neurological side effects of radiation and methane exposure, and the philosophy of consciousness, it feels like half a college curriculum in here. It also is not an easy book. I ended up waiting to finish it on a free day, where the book and I could spend as much time as we needed. In this way, it reminded me a great deal of Miéville's Embassytown.The narrative is fragmented into pieces, alternating between a linear description of a sort of first-contact event, and fragments of Siri's life, primarily from his youth and from his only romantic relationship. This is a future Earth where most people have been genetically engineered before birth. As they age, more and more people are choosing to join Heaven, a type of virtual reality for their consciousness, allowing their bodies to be stored elsewhere once they commit. Siri was an epileptic, and had half his brain removed to prevent further seizures. It left him with a curious sense of distance, which he developed into a skill, becoming a professional Synthesete. When an alien invention surveys Earth, a group of people are sent to the most likely place the aliens are lurking. Siri is part of that team as a professional observer.It's a complicated story, and while Watts does eventually provide many of the explanations (details on Heaven, details on vampires), it a faceted kind of story; you have to hold all these images in your mind and hope that they'll coalesce at some point. They mostly do, although there's a few spots when I think Watts has a few too many puzzle pieces to make into a coherent pattern. I was hoping for some sense of 'ah-ha,' but am instead left with a sense of both stretchy-ness and 'hmm.' The biggest idea is surrounds the idea of the brainstem, of function without consciousness.""'You think Rorschach grows them on some kind of assembly line. You can't find any genes. Maybe they are just biochemical machines.''That's what life is, Keeton. That's what you are.' Another hit of nicotine, another storm of numbers, another sample. 'Life isn't either/or. It's a matter of degree.""I will say that the first contact bits turned out to be absolutely fascinating, as well as the ideas of magnetic atmosphere and methane gases causing issues of health and perception. His discussions on game theory and first contact are depressing as hell and would probably be a real strategy by some people.Writing is occasionally transcendent. All in all, I'm going to have to bump it up after my second read. While I may not like every one, and certainly hope that humanity will do better, I have to say that this was one of the most stunning first contact stories I've ever read.Their marriage decayed with the exponential determinism of a radioactive isotope and still he sought her out, and accepted her conditions. The weakest spot for both me and my co-readers on my second read was the inclusion of the vampire species. It felt somewhat weak, and like there were other mechanisms Watts could have used to accomplish those same goals. Nonetheless, I think it's quite an amazing book, with a lot of food for thought.Of the Goodreads reviews, I would point you towards mark monday's, who addresses the philosophical angle Watts seemed to be heading toward. Lightreads also has an uncharacteristically long, but characteristically brilliant, review that includes a nice note of what the reader is in for, as well as a long segment of Watt's writing. I happen to agree with Lightreads, that I'm guessing it would read best if one is conversant with some of the -ologies in the book. Off the top of my head, linguistics, astronomy, philosophy, evolution, neurology, biology, and physics all play parts in the story.My edition included a series of mini-essays by Watts about the philosophical foundations of the book. I particularly enjoyed 'Sleight of Mind' (hacking the brain), 'Are We There Yet' (the space travel insight), alien anatomy and physiology, and 'Sentience/Intelligence,' all of which are heavily footnoted, usually with articles or journals. I laughed at footnote #130: ""This validates me, and I wish it happened more often. ¹³°130: I am by nature insecure. I blame bad parenting.""Note for later--short film Watts consulted on (5 minutes) for re-read (thanks, Caro!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkR2h...Read again March 2021, with a lovely group of people: Nataliya, Stephen, Phil and David. Thank you all for your additional insights.",304,47
48484,Blindsight,mark monday,"1,619",4955,4,"August 7, 2012","what is Consciousness? how did the silly human race evolve beyond the herd instinct, beyond our reptile brain? how, and why? what is the purpose of our individuality, what is the need for our sense of self, what use is Human Connection, why are we even equipped with Empathy? for some naive, kinda-sorta spiritual folks (like myself), these things may explain the existence of God. but that's rather besides the point of the question. does empathy help us in the long run, does the ability of humans to connect with each other truly offer anything besides constant discomfort and potential danger? is a psychopath who does not experience empathy somehow less than human? how would a highly developed species that has somehow evolved without empathy or individuality react to a species like ours - one that is contantly talking to itself, connecting, empathizing, exploring, throwing itself and its messages out into the void, to seek, to find, to understand, to know?exploring all of those questions is the purpose of Peter Watts' superb Blindsight. the novel is about one of those Ambiguous Threats Appearing in the Outskirts of Known Space. future Earth is a fucked-up Earth, no surprise there. humans regularly 'ascend' into a fake-sounding cyberheaven. vampires - apparently an extremely predatory offshoot of the homo sapien, complete with an anti-Euclidean mental bias that explains their phobia of crosses - have been revived and now serve the human race (the inclusion of vampires may sound cheesy, but believe me, it is one of more absorbing things about the novel). there is some deadly construct called the Icarus Array located somewhere near the sun, stationed there to ""protect"" us. sex is an outdated activity (perhaps the sole unconvincing part of the novel). genuine human contact rarely takes place face-to-face. your usual Cold Techno-Dystopia. the Ambiguous Threat is noted shortly after a startling ""Firefly"" effect occurs over the earth - an effect that appears to be the Ambiguous Threat's way of taking long-distance pictures of human shenanigans. so the silly humans decide to fling a crew of misfits out into the void to engage with said Ambiguous Threat. there's a woman who has compartmentalized herself into 4 different and distinctly individualistic personalities. there's a military type armed with slaved drones whose biggest flaw/greatest attribute is her ability to empathize with her enemies. there are a couple guys who project their consciousness through machinery, all inputs mediated by that machinery - all the better to study the world around them. there is the ship's captain, a sociopathic vampire mentally bonded to his ship's computer brain. and then there is our hero - a sort of minister of information, missing half a brain, trained to avoid all forms of true connection, unwilling to engage in basic empathy. this fascinating crew finds much to be fascinated with when confronting the Ambiguous Threat. for one, a spaceship that looks like it's from Dante's Inferno. aliens from, well, the Alien films, with some upsetting Predator type invisibility to boot. hallucinations and corresonding loss of self within those hallucinations. strange communications that sound full of villainous bravado - except those communications feel oversimplified, threatening in the most obvious of ways, purposely dumbed-down...to what end? the Ambiguous Threat appears capable of automatically healing its own hull, controlling thousands of asteroids at once, and harnessing the power of a gas giant... yet seems oddly powerless, even uncaring. things don't add up. despite all the crew sees and analyzes, the Ambiguous Threat has a rather terrifying lack of signifiers.the author is clearly a highly intelligent sort, PhD and everything, and the novel is full of Exra Hard Science Action. but i think folks are really mislabeling Blindsight if they consider it to be genuine Hard Science Fiction. to put it in the corniest of terms: this is a novel about the human condition. look at the dystopic details of this future Earth, review the cast of characters... Blindsight is built on examining all of the different options for humans and nonhumans to connect or not to connect, all the ways that individuals can reach across their individual sense of self to connect with another person's reality. the nature of the Ambiguous Threat and the root of our protagonist's problems are disconcertingly connected: a rejection of individuality; an inability to connect with others. the novel is elegantly constructed so that form follows meaning rather than narrative. this may be frustrating to folks who eschew literary novels in favor of genre fiction. that's understandable... ""narrative tension"" is definitely lost by the constant switching back and forth between parallel storylines. on the one hand, the protagonist's past life of non-communication and deliberate avoidance of empathy (shades of Dying Inside); on the other hand, the mission into the void (which itself is rife with pointed character flashblacks). but for Watts to have structured Blindsight in any other way would have been to lose the point of it all. the novel is not really about a dark space adventure. it is about the importance of empathetic connection, its value and its dangers, how it condemns us with one hand and lifts us up to a higher place with the other.oh, and one last thing... if that last sentence makes you think that this is one of those enriching spiritual journey type of books, think again. this awesome novel is about as bleak and pessimistic as they come. an important warning to keep in mind before approaching: this dog bites!",197,29
48484,Blindsight,Emily (Books with Emily Fox),525,56600,3,"January 8, 2022",This is one of the weirdest books I’ve ever read.,182,10
48484,Blindsight,Nataliya,710,11300,4,"April 24, 2021","This book was absolutely nothing like I expected. Little did I know that for my hard SF adventure I needed to be comfortable not only with astronomy and physics and biology but also a hefty dose of philosophy and neuroscience and evolution — and a mind-boggling exploration not even into the nature of conscience but in its utility or complete lack thereof. There are enough abstract concepts for my mind not just to grapple with but to grudgingly admit defeat against.What is it about? Well, on a surface it’s a First Contact story involving a crew of mentally and biologically augmented humans - or rather posthumans - on the “bleeding edge” of science, one resurrected apex predator (a scientifically plausible vampire with a Right Angle Glitch) and one advanced ship AI — all coming from the world of genetic engineering and virtual reality — tasked with exploration of an unknowable alien entity that takes them deep into the Oort Cloud.
  “And so we waited: four optimized hybrids somewhere past the threshold of mere humanity, one extinct predator who'd opted to command us instead of eating us alive.”
   And while they indeed find something very much alien in every imaginable way, this stops being your typical science fiction story and becomes a mind-breaking exploration of consciousness and hackable subjectivity of perception and torture and the inherent cruelty of game theory.
 “Imagine a crown of thorns, twisted, dark and unreflective, grown too thickly tangled to ever rest on any human head. Put it in orbit around a failed star whose own reflected half-light does little more than throw its satellites into silhouette. Occasional bloody highlights glinted like dim embers from its twists and crannies; they only emphasized the darkness everywhere else.Imagine an artefact that embodies the very notion of torture, something so wrenched and disfigured that even across uncounted lightyears and unimaginable differences in biology and outlook, you can't help but feel that somehow, the structure itself is in pain.Now make it the size of a city.”  It’s very dense and technical and really requires your full focus, and rereading the passages a few times, and sometimes just staring at the wall while the cogs in the brain try to grind.And it’s an unexpected ode to brainstem, that ancient reptilian brain that does all the work while the self-satisfied neocortex rests on its laurels, basking in the glory of that - possibly overrated - consciousness.It’s beyond my comprehension, really, to imagine a superbly intelligent creature that yet does not possess that seeming pinnacle of creation, that self-satisfied self-awareness, that crown jewel that gives us humans the tremendous satisfaction and perception of being infinitely better than all those poor non-sentient creatures. After all, if we have it and we are successful, then it’s the ultimate goal and a prerequisite for success, for *being*. Even our smartest machines would hypothetically need to pass that Turing test for us to award them with true recognition — the “being-ness” itself.
   “Point being you can use basic pattern-matching algorithms to participate in a conversation without having any idea what you're saying. Depending on how good your rules are, you can pass a Turing test.”
But what if all that is little but training wheels which are an impediment, really, if you forget to take the, off at some point? And is there any objective difference between feeling empathy and acting as though you feel empathy? And given how fragile it all is, what’s the point of putting it on the pedestal?
   “What's the survival value of obsessing on a sunset?”
  And then the ever-present dilemma of what to do when a new spacefaring intelligence is found. How do we go about friendliness or hostility? Do we assume the same competition approach, that damn zero sum game that served the winners throughout our history? At which point do you decide on the preventive strikes (that fragging euphemism for attack that nevertheless allows us to remain “the good guys”) and when do you justify torture itself? 
   “Killing innocents is the least of the risks you're running; you're gambling with the fate of worlds, provoking conflict with a star faring technology whose sole offense was to take your picture without permission.”“This is how you communicate with a fellow intelligence: you hurt it, and keep on hurting it, until you can distinguish the speech from the screams.”“She'd just fallen back on the oldest trick in the Torturer's Handbook, the one that lets you go home to your family after work, and play with your children, and sleep at night: never humanize your victims.”
Oh, and it’s so pessimistic and bleak that you’ll end up blankly staring at a wall for a while after it all ends. That fragging elusive “human condition” that would not have been a problem had we allowed our reptilian brain to truly run the show.  Every theme addressed can sprout volumes upon volumes of frantic writing. But it’s that concept of consciousness as opposed to intelligence, and the survival / fitness value of those that made it hard for me. Electromagnetic radiation and its effects on the brain? Sure. Alien biology? No problem. Walking corpse syndrome? Alrighty. Spacefaring without consciousness, advanced math without self-awareness? Ummmm, huh???
   “Because if Sarasti was right, scramblers were the norm: evolution across the universe was nothing but the endless proliferation of automatic, organized complexity, a vast arid Turing machine full of self-replicating machinery forever unaware of its own existence. And we—we were the flukes and the fossils. We were the flightless birds lauding our own mastery over some remote island while serpents and carnivores washed up on our shores.”“There's no such things as survival of the fittest. Survival of the most adequate, maybe. It doesn't matter whether a solution's optimal. All that matters is whether it beats the alternative.” 
It’s a difficult, dense book - but of the kind that makes you think long and hard about the validity of the concepts it discusses, the book that is not going for patting you on the back for putting in the effort but instead throws more challenges at you. It’s the book that demands concentration and focus and occasional looking up things to make sure you’re getting it right. It’s a challenge, and one that I found to be worth the time and investment. It’s not quite enjoyable in the way I’m used to, but rather uncomfortably fascinating and definitely not one for mass appeal. And I’m quite alright with that.But damn, do I wish it was just a bit less bleak.4 stars. 
  “I shook my head. ""I just observe, that's all. I watch what people do, and then I imagine what would make them do that.""""Sounds like empathy to me.""""It's not. Empathy's not so much about imagining how the other guy feels. It's more about imagining how you'd feel in the same place, right?""Pag frowned. ""So?""""So what if you don't know how you'd feel?”

48484,Blindsight,Terry ,391,2137,4,"April 5, 2013","Wow. This was a tough one. It was a very good hard sf book that I don't think I'll be coming back to anytime soon. As others have said: ""abandon all hope ye who enter here."" A well written, excruciating exploration of the human ""problem"" where it turns out that it really is a problem. How do you take a book whose central premise seems to be that the development of self-awareness in human evolution was a wrong turn that wasn't meant to happen at all? That it was in fact contrary to the entire development of intelligence throughout the rest of the universe that only occurred due to a fluke in the evolution of a competing species? Talk about being alone in an uncaring reality. Watts manages to take Lovecraft's primary hobby horse and make it work in a way that is truly frightening in its utter nihilism. This isn't a scary universe because Watts tells us so (as it would have been had Lovecraft wrote the tale), it's scary because he shows us so. Our primary filter for information is Siri Keeton, a man with literally only half a brain. Due to a childhood trauma he was essentially lobotomized and given computer processors to make up for what was removed. Siri obviously lost a lot during the process, but ""gained"" the ability to be the ultimate ""Chinese Room"" for humanity...for all that was worth. His whole life he has been trying to understand even 'baseline' humans and his facility with doing so, with looking at the human enigma on the surface and from the outside, and parsing it correctly has led him to become a professional conduit between these baseline humans and the posthuman entities they have created and made to work for them. He is a uniquely appropriate narrator for this tale as his very mode of existence showcases Watts' entire argument in microcosm; and interestingly his entire development as a character is the reverse of the development of the story and even of the universe itself. Siri's story starts and ends as a very lonely one, but for very different reasons. Another fascinating element of the tale is the fairly unique use of vampires as an off-shoot sub-species of humanity originally destroyed due to humanity's self-awareness and then brought back by high science to be our servants. These are probably the most frightening vampires I've yet come across in fiction, not only because of the pseudo-scientific ""plausibility"", but primarily because of what we eventually discover about them in the story's conclusion. I will say very little about ""Rorschach"", the alien entity with whom humanity attempts to communicate in this tale of first contact, except to say that the Lovecraftian enigma of its seeming indifference to human existence is truly chilling in its implications. Far more than any dreaming Cthulhu, Rorschach is an entity whose strangeness is truly to be feared.All in all this was a rewarding, though deeply uncomfortable, read.

48484,Blindsight,Jenne,"1,086",655,2,"June 4, 2007","Okay, I gave this book TWO second chances because I had heard great things about it, but I eventually gave up.It's certainly a gutsy choice to have a person with no empathy as your main character, but it's pretty hard to get readers to care about someone who has only a vaguely intellectual interest in other people. Especially if the story is told in the first person by this character. So as a result, we know that one guy is a vampire, and another guy has some kind of prosthetic senses, and there's a military woman and another woman with a multiple personality. We don't really get to know much else about them, or at least not by page 183.The other problem I had with this book was that it was hard to picture exactly where everyone was and what they were doing in whatever scene. Most of the action takes place in a spaceship, and you never get a clear idea of how it's set up, plus there are all these sort of virtual-reality things going on at the same time, and the vampire guy tends to hide out in his room and you don't really know where that is, and I think there are supposed to be some kind of tents that the people live in? On a spaceship? I don't know.Anyway, it's not that a book has to be easy to read; I like books that are complicated, but I think it's the mark of a good writer that you shouldn't have to be wondering where the aft thruster maintenance room is instead of just being engrossed in the story.",103,19
48484,Blindsight,Becky,"1,308",1595,3,"August 10, 2014","Yeeeaahhh... I'm kinda not sure what I just read or how I should feel about this book. So, I'm going to revert to my usual fallback position of ""random typing to see what words show up"" and call it a review. Look ma, no consciousness! O_oSo, one the one hand, I can see how certain types of readers would think this book is brilliant and love it. This is smart, hard sci-fi, dealing with matters of humanity (as most SF does) and asking some really interesting questions about what sentience is and what makes human consciousness and intelligence unique. On that level, I think this book was great. Smarter than me, for sure, but I can appreciate that. I ain't mad atcha, book! Unfortunately, on just about every OTHER level, for me, this was a big letdown. I think that a lot of that is due to my expectations. This is one of the reasons why I like to go in to a book without knowing anything about it. Blind, if you will. (See what I did there?) But with this one... I was at the point of giving up on it and so I broke down and got some perspective on the book from others reading it. That didn't work out for me either, though. Based on the discussion (and the genres on the book page, to be fair), I really thought that this was going to be a SF Horror book, complete with a comparison to the movie Event Horizon - a comparison that I don't see at all. I kept waiting for the book to get super depraved and horrorish... and I waited in vain. There was a tiny portion of the book where it seemed that it could go that way, but I blinked and almost missed it. So, my expectations for what this book actually was definitely hurt my enjoyment, but having no expectations at all wasn't any better because I was bored and confused and really struggling with understanding the narrative and structure and what was actually being relayed. I don't think that I'm a stupid person, nor a lazy reader. I do read mostly for enjoyment, but I also read to learn and experience new ideas, etc. I am willing to work to earn a payoff. But for me, this book was all work, and no payoff. I came out of this book thinking that it could have been much cleaner and much more structured and would have been a better book for it. I don't mind the multiple storylines or flashbacks or the characters who don't use pronouns or anything other than present verb tenses. I'm fine with those things, though the dialogue is super technical and confusing before adding those quirks in. Just sayin'. What I'm referring to regarding the structure is mainly the beginning, where every little mini-chapter gives us a little drop-you-in-the-moment snippet of infodump, some in first person, some in second person, all in faith that the reader will be a patient one and stick with it despite having no idea what the hell any of it means. But, you know, as I type this, I kinda think that I'm actually starting to appreciate it a little more because I'm realizing that all of what I just said about the confusion really just puts the reader that much more into the story directly. BUT- it's one of those books that you'd likely have to read at least twice to really fully appreciate. It really did require almost insane levels of patience for me to complete it. So much of the book is just info and tech specs and observation, and try as I might to find it interesting, it bored me for a huge chunk of the book. The last 10% or so brought it all together, and looking at the WHOLE, it's a much more cohesive story than it seemed to be as I was reading it. *Sigh* So I've come full circle. It's brilliant, but damn frustrating. Yup. That about sums it up, so I'm giving it 2 stars for the frustration and one additional for the retrospective brilliance. ",88,13

    “He wasn't just grasping at the limb, I realized as I joined them. He was tugging at it. He was trying to pull it off.Something laughed hysterically, right inside my helmet.”
  
 Okay so I have decided hardcore sci-fi isn't my thing, I get confused with all the descriptions and literally had to google half the words in this book. The writing was a little tedious, 100 pages in and I still didn't have a clue what was going on and nearly put down as DNF. However this book turned amazing at the half way point & I literally couldn't put it down, it was fascinating, creepy, warped, wonderful & extremely different. When people talk about horror in sci-fi, I imagine something pretty cheesy. This book had no cheese what so ever and was actually pretty creepy. I had goosebumps and had to check my wardrobe for aliens, before bed. So if you like shitting your pants, this book is for you.So overall I enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it to all fans of sci-fi & horror.Ps it had the most badass space vampires ever.Buddy read with my fellow Katie Perry fanboy;Sir Twerks ",87,45
48484,Blindsight,Greg,92,149,5,"February 23, 2010","You know you're in for trouble when the dedication of the book says:""If we're not in pain, we're not alive.""One of the quotes before the novel starts is:""you will die like a dog for no good reason""And the quote that starts the first chapter is one by Ted Bundy!But still, it's a sci-fi book about consciousness...how could I not love it?-----------------------------------------I've always loved Science Fiction, and not just because books about the future are inherently cool. The reason I've always loved science fiction is because I've always loved philosophy. From a young age I enjoyed thinking about what makes us human, what is the nature of ""self"", what is the nature of reality, and a host of other questions along those lines. Science fiction stories are able to take philosophical thought experiments and put them into a literal environment. This type of setting might not serve to replace an in-depth philosophical or scientific analysis, but it will certainly serve to prompt your mind into a continued exploration of these ideas, with the benefit of telling the story in a far more interesting way than can be done in 1800s London! (sorry Dickens)Blindsight might be one of the most superb books I've ever read at this type of story telling. In part because every aspect of this book is infused with it, from the nature of the characters themselves, to the dialog, to the plot. Whether you want your philosophy just beneath the surface or knocking you over the head, this book will deliver...as long as you want both. On the surface Blindsight is your classic first contact story, with a special team sent to the edge of the solar system to make contact with an alien intelligence. But in this not to distant future humanity has modified itself to the point where none of the characters involved are recognizably human. While this might not be the newest plot device ever, it's not in the realm of physical differences that sets these characters apart, but in mental differences. In the nature of their consciousness. And it is when they finally make contact with the aliens, who, paradoxically, may be intelligent but not sentient, and who further, are not particularly happy to see them, that the story really grabs you by the balls (or whatever you prefer to be grabbed by). Watts was seamlessly able to mix action, terror, and philosophy into one engaging narrative. Something I didn't think could be easily done.A few of the more interesting questions (to me) in regards to consciousness have to do with why consciousness would ever have evolved. What were its benefits? What were the mechanisms that allowed it to evolve? What function did it serve? Blindsight doesn't attempt to answer any of these questions specifically. But what it does do, and do brilliantly, is pose a whole bunch of related questions that make those questions I asked even more important. Anyone familiar with neurological conditions such as agnosia, neglect, and yes, blindsight, knows that the brain can go wrong in countless ways, radically altering our conscious experience. Anyone who has excelled at a sport or a musical instrument knows that thinking too consciously about something just interferes with your ability to do it well. By pointing out the drawbacks and limitations of consciousness, Watts forces us ask ourselves, ""what IS consciousness good for?""I found something that I wrote some years back, it was just a passing thought that I never explored, but it was this:Consciousness almost seems like a bad adaptive trait. It almost gets in the way sometimes. Limits our focus. Why do we have a brain that can store so much data, but this consciousness that has a limit of the awareness of the data. If any of these questions interest you, and you enjoy science fiction, and don't mind a bit of a darker bend to you reading material, do yourself a favor and check out this book. It's also one of the only fiction books I've ever read that actually had a whole section of notes and references after the last chapter, briefly explaining all the legitimate scientific sources the ideas in the book were taken from. Kudos Watts. ",73,9
48484,Blindsight,Rachel (TheShadesofOrange),"1,956",2668,5,"May 1, 2021","4.5 Stars This was a brilliantly unique alien contact story that was like nothing I had ever read (or watched) before. Blending together science fiction and horror, this novel was dark and creepy in a rather innovative way. This narrative was very dense in terms of plot and scientific theory. Admittedly, some of it went over my head, but what I did understand, I absolutely loved. This story was incredibly thought provoking and often mind bending as it discussed topics such communication, intelligence and consciousness. I would highly recommend this fascinating hard scifi novel to any seasoned reader of the genre. Also, be sure to read the notes at the end, which explained the scientific ideas behind this fictional future. I love it more with a second reread.",58,N/A
48484,Blindsight,Doyle,218,4,1,"July 15, 2020","I spent a majority of this book being lost. Not so lost in the ludicrous amounts of science jargon as I was confused by the ""who/what is this?"" Though the author sacrifices story and pacing at every convenience to flex his brain and show off all the cutting edge science theory he reviewed to prepare for writing this, my main bitch is simply not being able to follow even basic conversations held between characters. Every character/space ship/astral body in this book has a name, and possibly an additional nickname. You better set the brief description associated with that name in stone the first time through because there are almost NO context clues to help you figure out what type of object the author is referring to afterwards. I'm glad that the cover of this book has a picture of what the main space ship looks like, otherwise I would have never known how the main setting was laid out. I'm sure the ship was described at some point, but the author probably referred to it's nickname, and shoved in tedious minutia details to really bore me into not remembering. Here is a list my further bitching that I'm not going to elaborate on:1. The main human character is largely un-relatable and has zero emotion at any point. 2. Secondary characters are all the same character (personality-wise), save the vampire. 3. There is a vampire in this book for no god damn reason. 4. The first chapter starts out suspiciously like the first chapter of Ender's Game. 5. Secondary character introductions are made 100 pages too late.6. Seemingly inconsequential plot points are glossed over, then revealed to be incredibly important in the last chapter. The last chapter? I can't believe I made it to the last chapter.",55,8

This book is also discuss about behavioral and consciousness, oh just read other reviews for details, I am not good discussing heavy subjects.My only concern is the ending, not satisfying enough for me. I felt like read a novel that will have a direct sequel/continuation. I was ready to give this book a five star, then when the (supposedly) climax part hit me, I changed my mind and rated this book a four star.",54,2
48484,Blindsight,Alex,36,5,3,"July 31, 2007","I'm still having a hard time figuring out what I think about this book. I don't believe that it is well written, but I also don't believe that it is a bad book. Let's start with the first one. I've had a brief note up here for a while about this book that pretty much defines why I don't think it's well written. Take a look at this quote:""There have always been those tasked with the rotation of informational topologies, but throughout most of history they had little to do with increasing its clarity.""Italics his. Oh, the irony of the italics. His problem is that he really relies on jargon an awful lot to make his descriptions, and for people who don't use that same terminology, it can be like slogging through mud to understand what he's saying. In the first third of the book, I thought this was going to be the worst of the nominees, just because I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. In the rest of the book, once he's done with setup and back story, it gets better. But it never fully goes away, and the fact that the setup and back story are so unreadable - and yet so important - is a pretty huge problem. Now on to my second point. I believe this is actually a good book. The characters are distinct and interesting, the world he created is believable, even if the ""vampire"" concept is a little out there. But most importantly, he did science fiction with aliens and he did it right. This is something that he even cites in the acknowledgments, but when you're doing aliens, you need to make them unrecognizable. This is a huge challenge, but you have to conceive of a species that evolved in a completely different environment, coming up a completely different path and becoming something completely unlike humanity. Or anything else on Earth for that matter. Talking cats don't count. His aliens are the most plausibly non-human I have ever seen. I'm giving this book it's score largely based on that. I want to give it four stars just because of that, but the poor writing and the fact that it feels a little unfinished at the end make it hard to do that. It has a great second act, one that doesn't quite live up to its potential for me, but a worthy hugo nominee all the same. Even though I'm giving this book a lower score than the others, this may be the winner in my opinion. The aliens may not make it rise above other books in terms of the writing, but in a science fiction contest, I believe they do. NOTE: After reading Glasshouse, my personal award goes to that novel and not this one. Stross managed to do everything right in that one. ",44,7
48484,Blindsight,Lightreads,641,520,4,"December 28, 2008","Yes, it is not quite as good as I’d been told, but orders of magnitude more brilliant than anyone had conveyed. Which statement will be very puzzling to anyone who hasn’t read the book, but just take my word for it: it makes perfect sense. And yes, this book will deservedly win this year’s Hugo, if the rumblings are right. Sorry, Temeraire, you’ll have another shot, I’m sure. So. The actual review. Summarizing this book is quite difficult without being far too parsimonious or far too verbose. It’s SF, and there ain’t much squishy here. It’s told by Siri Keeton, informational synthesist, professional observer, member of a tiny human expedition sent out to meet an unknown alien presence at the outskirts of the solar system. Mostly human – it’s hard to classify people living on the “bleeding edge” of the future, with edited brains and altered bodies. They meet the Scramblers, an alien race more frighteningly alien than anything I’ve ever seen in any other science fiction. There they are reminded of the eminent hackability of the human brain, what a fragile machine it really is, and that’s just the start.It’s hard, because I want everyone to read this book, though I know the majority of people won’t get past the first fifty pages. It’s not just the hard SF elements, not the dense but oddly beautiful prose. This book just requires a lot. It’s packed tight with theory, and I don’t know what it would be like going in without at least a conversant background in biology, psychology, neurology, a bit of physics. It’s just that, when the boom swings around about three-quarters of the way in and smacks you on the forehead, you really should be leaning forward eagerly into it. And I don’t think that’ll work if you’re struggling to keep up with the ologies. The science isn’t background here, it’s not ambiance, and the unprepared reader would probably be very puzzled by an obscure and strangely technical alien encounter book. Because you’ve got to do the work to get the payoff. It’s one of those arguments which is reduced out of all reasonableness by reduction at all – that’s why it’s not made often. Watts called this book a “thought experiment.” It’s about intelligence existing in the absence of sentience, of that conscious I first person narrator. About the brilliance of our brainstems; they are faster than us, smarter than us, perfectly capable of surviving just fine without upper management – that’s what the brainstem is for, after all, surviving. Blindsight starts there, and then bypasses the perennial bottleneck of what consciousness is, and goes straight on to what it’s for. Evolutionarily. Biologically. I think its conclusions are wrong. Well, I hope its conclusions are wrong. But it’s brilliant none the less.""You invest so much in it, don't you? It's what elevates you above the beasts of the field, it's what makes you special. Homo sapiens, you call yourself.Wise Man. Do you even know what it is, this consciousness you cite in your own exaltation? Do you even know what it's for?Maybe you think it gives you free will. Maybe you've forgotten that sleepwalkers converse, drive vehicles, commit crimes and clean up afterwards, unconsciousthe whole time. Maybe nobody's told you that even waking souls are only slaves in denial. Make a conscious choice. Decide to move your index finger. Too late! The electricity's already halfway down your arm. Your body began to act a full half-secondbefore your conscious self 'chose' to, for the self chose nothing; something else set your body in motion, sent an executive summary—almost an afterthought—to the homunculus behind your eyes. That little man, that arrogant subroutine that thinks of itself as the person, mistakes correlation for causality:it reads the summary and it sees the hand move, and it thinks that one drove the other.But it's not in charge. You're not in charge. If free will even exists, it doesn't share living space with the likes of you.Insight, then. Wisdom. The quest for knowledge, the derivation of theorems, science and technology and all those exclusively human pursuits that must surelyrest on a conscious foundation. Maybe that's what sentience would be for— if scientific breakthroughs didn't spring fully-formed from the subconsciousmind, manifest themselves in dreams, as full-blown insights after a deep night's sleep. It's the most basic rule of the stymied researcher: stop thinkingabout the problem. Do something else. It will come to you if you just stop being conscious of it.""A fascinating, difficult book. I was right there all the way, but then again I took a lot less convincing than many readers probably will. That, and I was highly entertained by the quick and dirty tour of some of the stranger stops in the DSM-IV (oh right, there’s Cotard’s Syndrome. Love that one). Not for everyone by its very nature, and also by necessity populated with strange, uncuddly people and stranger situations, so that a casual, surface read of a typical hard SF story may or may not be enjoyable. I don’t know, and the inaccessibility is not a flaw, it’s a necessity. I do know that I admire the single-mindedness required to write so narrowly, so smartly, and that it's definitely worth the work, if you're positioned for it.",41,7
48484,Blindsight,Twerking To Beethoven,354,58,3,"April 30, 2017","BR with Pizza, spaghetti, mandolino, Luciano Pavarotti and you can't even sing who happens to be a way quicker reader than ole Twerk.I learned an awful lot of new words while going through this book, mostly because I found myself being forced to in order to even follow its most basic level of dialogue. Hands up, you bastids, who knows what ""malapropism"" means? Ha! Gotcha. I do now, but that's because I googled that shit along with heaps of funny words that I have now forgotten. In the really technical sections of the story it was a challenge, at times, to even follow the plot. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I read ""Blindsight"", but... mostly for how much it makes appreciate all the more the other works that make hard science fiction look so much more elegant and seamless. Rendezvous with Rama and 2001: A Space Odyssey come to mind. It works, but it's likely going to make you work a bit as well.Three stars.",40,7
