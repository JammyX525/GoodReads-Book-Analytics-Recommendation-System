61905,Barrayar,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,"1,878",22600,4,"April 5, 2020","4+ stars. Barrayar--a Hugo winner and Nebula nominee back in 1991--is a book that improved dramatically for me on reread. It's more interesting, subtle and complex than I initially gave it credit for. And it's fascinating to see the development of Cordelia and Aral's characters from their initial beginnings in Shards of Honor, and their growing relationships with each other and with the people around them.The first half of Barrayar is a little on the quiet side, more deliberately paced, as Cordelia, a woman with socially liberal views, comes to terms with her new life as Lady Vorkosigan in the rigidly traditional and militaristic society on Barrayar. Her husband Aral is appointed as regent to the child emperor of Barrayar, which puts Cordelia and Aral in the bull's eye of political machinations ... which become more dangerous than either of them anticipated. Readers who are familiar with Miles Vorkosigan from the later books in this series will get the beginning of his story here, and it's well worth your time. The second half is a whirlwind, a heart-stopping adventure with Cordelia and her new friends at the center of a desperate plan that has far-reaching implications for the entire planet of Barrayar. The first half might be a bit slow-paced for some, as it sets up the second half, but it's worth the wait!Cordelia is a character for the ages, an outspoken, unstoppable force whose steely determination is combined with intelligence, a warm heart and concern for the people around her ... other than those that are causing trouble for Cordelia or those she loves.""He tried to hurt Aral through me. I found that . . . annoying. I wish you would cease trying to annoy me, Count Vordarian, I'm afraid you might succeed."" Her voice fell further, almost to a whisper. ""You should fear it, too.""Aral is a great foil for her, a strong character in his own right, but it's Cordelia who's at the center of this story. I'd love to meet her. She'd probably kick my butt into shape in a dozen ways I didn't realize were needed until she pointed them out to me.",98,6
61905,Barrayar,karen,"3,968",17000,4,"June 4, 2020","many thanks to eh and elizabeth etc, because i would never never never have read a book with a cover like this, but i did it for youse, and it has been wonderful, really.but so if i am understanding this correctly (and i hope that i am not) ms. bujold created one of the most interesting and likable-while-still-being-flawed characters ever and then abandoned her to write books about this character's son?? and all the rest are about him?? so lame.because i loved this book. i love cordelia. i love bujold's writing, too, so i am sure the other books are equally good, but come on! you got a good thing going here, don't deviate right when you got me interested! this is a five-star character here, she is all good things. i am not ready to start over with someone else. i did not expect to find such focus on well-rounding the characters in a piece of genre fiction. usually the focus is on the events, not on the psychology of the characters. this one is very character-driven, with plenty of action at the same time. there is humor, there is very close attention paid to details, and the focus is on mature, reasonable adults making decisions based on carefully considered facts. this pretty much sums it up; a character who assesses the situation, and manages to be self-sacrificing and unwhiny even though she has so much cause to be.""And what is your current complaint?""I don't like Barrayar, I want to go home, my father-in-law wants to murder my baby, half my friends are running for their lives, and I can't get ten minutes alone with my husband, whom you people are consuming before my eyes, my feet hurt, my head hurts, my soul hurts...It was all too complicated.The poor man just wanted something to put in his blank, not an essay.""Fatigue,"" Cordelia managed at last.love.because she is not a passive angelic beth type. but she understands what each situation calls for, she is eminently capable, and i admire that more than anything else in a human and in a written character. i love her dignity and that fact that she can also be frail. i want to say i will read more of these, but i feel like cordelia broke up with me before i was ready for her to do so, and i kind of want to prostrate myself before her and beg her to come back to me.she will, won't she?someday??come to my blog!",75,96
61905,Barrayar,Melindam,607,255,5,"August 23, 2022","Barrayar - chronologically Book #2 in the series, the Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold - is Space Opera at its best. Describing it in opera terms: it is bel canto (""florid and intricate, requiring supreme agility and pitch control"") combined with powerful and dramatic storytelling and LMB just got what it takes to write a damn fantastic libretto. The first part seems restrained, introducing dramatis personae & laying the ground for further action. LMB is gradually raising the stakes or increasing the volume & intensity, if you like, until a breathtaking climax descends upon us. The story starts right where Book #1, Shards of Honour finished. The emperor of Barrayar is dying and has appointed Aral Vorkosigan as regent until his grandson, Gregor, now 5, grows up. Aral's wife, Cordelia - coming from a technologically & socially much more developed planet - finds it hard to fit into to Barrayaran society and struggles to come to figure out its strange and complicated customs. Barrayar is rigidly feudal, dominated by a military caste and its technology borders on ""medieval"", due to an almost complete isolation from other planets. Most of the leaders, the so-called Vors, resist change and consider Aral's leadership as revolutionary and endangering their very existence. After the emperor's death a period of political and military unrest begins that endangers both Cordelia & Aral (as well as the child-emperor), their friends & allies and has far-reaching consequences none of them foresaw. I continued to like both Cordelia and Aral: they are wonderfully strong characters in their different ways. The love, respect, trust and support they give each other is amazing. As for Cordelia: she gets baffled by her new home planet and its people, but won't let herself be manipulated or frightened for a second by political enemies. She is one hell of a brave and capable woman. When her unborn baby's life is endangered due to an assassination attempt, she never plays the big drama-queen, but grabs the doctors ""by the balls"" and forces / coaxes / bribes them into saving the fetus even though she is aware of the strong animosity concerning disabled people referred to by most Barrayarns as ""mutations"" & her own father-in-law threatens to abort the baby personally.The trademark, dry humour of LMB is there throughout and manages to lighten the mood which gets fairly dark by the end. The storyline of political manoeuvering and military tactics is very well depicted: it stays exciting and engaging until the very last moment and my very favourite scene: a dramatic escape of pursuers in horseback (in a Sci-Fi novel) is just priceless.Thanks to Evgeny for the recommendation and pointing out the right reading-order. :)[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",57,4
61905,Barrayar,Choko,"1,166",2568,5,"February 10, 2017","*** 4.75 ***A buddy read with Evgeny, because we love Sci-fi!Wow!!! Just WOW!!! This is the third book in the chronological order of the series and I am already addicted to it! It is Sci-fi, but this one was on a planet very similar to Earth, Barrayar. No space battles, no new monsters, if we don't count the Barrayar Vors, the planet's nobility, who all act like monsters most of the time. No robots and no new races of humanoids. Just the life of Vorkosigan and Cordelia four months after they got married. He is taking his position as a regent to the young Emperor Gregor, and this is cutting into their private time and putting them in a very dangerous position, being a target for everyone with political ambitious. The relationship is severely tested when an assassination attempt puts the very pregnant Cordelia and her baby in mortal danger. The possibility that the baby is most likely going to be born with severe disabilities puts the love of the mother counter to the believes of the old nobility that it would be much better for the baby to be terminated at once than to bring shame to the family with its weaknesses and deformities. Coming from the much more liberal and progressive Beta Colony, Cordelia is ready to fight whoever stands in the way to her child's survival. And the numbers of those grow exponentially when a civil war for the throne tears up the very tenuous peace between the full blooded contenders of the Emperor of these war loving militant people. On top of that, Cordelia has to remind her husband why he married her in the first place - because she is the smartest, bravest, most carrying person he had ever met! The book started with a lot of political machinations and intrigues, goes through couple of assassination attempts, some time for Cornelia to adjust to her new home, and introduction to several new characters, including the emperor, his mom, and their female bodyguard Dru, who rapidly becomes a perfect fit within the already established group of Cordelia, Vorkosigan and the two misfits soldiers who are now in their employee. They provide some of the comedy relief, as well as a great support for the crazy schemes Cordelia tends to come up with in the most hopeless situation. I love them all as a group now and would hate for anything bad to happen to anyone!!! I am putting the author on notice from the start! Don't break my heart, LMB! Yes, I know the books have already been written, but I like to pretend they write themselves magically as I read them. Gives me that false sense of control I like to delude myself with ☺! I loved the way the book became a mad dash for survival in the second half and I could not put it down for a minute after I reached that juncture. It was intense, it was smart, and it was emotional without being melodramatic. I am in love! Now I can't wait to see if all this worry, death and blood was worth it, and I have been promised a heck of an adventure with young Miles Naismith Vorkosigan as we go deeper into the series! I can't wait ☺☺☺!I wish you all Happy Reading and many more wonderful books to come!",50,35
61905,Barrayar,mark monday,"1,619",4955,3,"May 6, 2013","Barrayar continues and completes the story of former survey ship captain Cordelia Naismith and her husband Aral Vorkosigan, Regent of Barrayar. it is pretty enjoyable. is Bujold becoming one of my favorite scifi authors? i'm surprised at that realization. her style is not particularly striking, often rather plain and unadorned. i don't usually gravitate to those sorts of writers - the straightforward ones. but her themes, her careful way with characterization, her undramatic recognition of the complexity, fallibility, and occasional heroism of the human species are all things that this usually impartial robot observer finds himself genuinely responding to, with uncharacteristic human warmth.characterization is clearly Bujold's major strength and this novel supplies ample opportunity for intriguingly multi-leveled characters to shine. in particular Bothari - poor Bothari! - so damaged by life and the terrible things done to him that he has become a person who will take on the persona of whoever he is needed to be. his need for someone to guide him, his craving for validation and for purpose... made so palpable by Bujold.the first half of the novel is pretty intimate in scale. it mainly concerns various domestic issues (and by ""domestic"" i mean ""in & around the home"" rather than ""homeland"") as Cordelia acclimates to the overly formal, high-strung, and resolutely warlike Barrayaran culture. it feels odd and a little wrong to use the words domestic and intimate when describing a (low-key) space opera whose first half includes two assassination attempts and various other dramatic incidents. but that is the feeling i got and it worked really well. the reader gets to know Barrayar in an unhurried fashion, just like Cordelia. and the reader continues to understand Cordelia in that same deliberate, slowly unfolding sort of a way. i liked the lack of hustle & bustle and i appreciated the calm, unrushed pace.it all changes in the second part. and so swiftly! from slow acclimatization right into a fast-moving adventure narrative, things happening pell-mell... a flight, a rescue, a secret journey, confrontations, deaths, a raging fire... my gosh, a head gets cut off and carried in a bag to be dramatically tossed onto a boardroom table! awesome. it was incredibly satisfying to see how well Cordelia adapted to her new world, how easily she is able to win others to her side, how passionate and furious and even murderous she can get when dealing with people who have attacked her loved ones. Mother Bear! yet she still stays herself - compassionate, warm-hearted, saddened & angered by the small-mindedness of others. she's an awesome character. and this is a satisfying book.",43,18
61905,Barrayar,Lizzy,305,167,4,"February 7, 2017","“I am afraid.” So simply opens Barrayar with Cordelia words. It takes places immediately after the events of Shards of Honor and starts out with low-key family strife that sets the tone along with political developments. All the time, Lois McMaster Bujold’s character build up takes center stage. All in all, it is much more than the science-fiction tag that describes it.
  “My home is not a place, it is people.”
The beginning might be slow though not less significant, and it is preparing for what is to come. Cordelia is adjusting to an overly formal, aristocratic and warlike Barrayar. However, half-way through the rhythm changes. Then there is a revolution, a secret journey, vital prisoners, bloodshed and death, a rescue, a raging fire, and ultimately a triumphant return. Yes, there is so much to enjoy in Barrayar. It might be very character-driven, but there is plenty of action to satisfy any reader. Above all, Bujold’s masterful writing keeps the reader’s interest fully engaged.The action scenes are well written and believable, but it’s Bujold’s characters that lift the book to another level. They are all very human. I particularly appreciated the relationship between Cordelia and Aral. There is tension, as should be expected, but their marriage comes out solid in the end. They are a team against whatever comes against them. And Bujold establishes it particularly well through their dialogues:
  “His naked agony terrified her. She held him tightly in return. ‘I don’t know. I don’t know. But somebody has been making these kinds of decisions right along, while we went along blissfully unconscious, taking the world as given. And they were only humans, too. No better, no worse than you.’‘Frightening thought.’She sighed. ‘You can’t choose between evil and evil, in the dark, by logic. You can only cling to some safety line of principle.’ …‘Dear Captain, If I’m still sane, fifteen years from now, I believe it will be your doing.’
For those that enjoyed Shards of Honor like me, it is very satisfying to see how well Cordelia adapts to her new home, how easily she wins accomplices to her side, how furious or even murderous she is with those that hurt her loved ones. Above all, she is still her own woman. When after an assassination attempt, Cordelia and Aral’s unborn son suffers permanent after-effects, their relationship is tested but comes out strong as he supports Cordelia’s effort to save their son. When Miles is born, I felt her words to him were meaningful and particularly poignant:
   “Welcome to Barrayar, son. Here you go: have a world of wealth and poverty, wrenching change and rooted history. Have a birth; have two. Have a name. Miles means ""soldier,"" but don't let the power of suggestion overwhelm you. Have a twisted form in a society that loathes and fears the mutations that have been its deepest agony. Have a title, wealth, power, and all the hatred and envy they will draw. Have your body ripped apart and re-arranged. Inherit an array of friends and enemies you never made. Have a grandfather from hell. Endure pain, find joy, and make your own meaning, because the universe certainly isn't going to supply it. Always be a moving target. Live. Live. Live.”
The conclusion is not only strong, but also lays the groundwork for the rest of the series. And leaves us wanting more!Highly recommended!",35,16
61905,Barrayar,Trish,"1,846",3363,5,"December 3, 2017","I am so sold on Cordelia and Aral as a couple. This might be an old scifi saga but it's one that has aged well in my opinion.This is the third book, chronologically, and tells of Cordelia after she married Aral Vorkosigan and came to live with him on Barrayar. Naturally, a few things about this society are alien to her (and to us) but she also realizes some weird things about her own culture and that both aren't exactly perfect. Moreover, since the Emperor has appointed Aral regent, there is a lot of stuff to organize and get used to. Originally, Cordelia thought she'd marry a retired military commander, but now she finds herself in the middle of political intrigue, attempted assassinations and the likes.But not to worry: Cordelia is kick-ass once again, while still being her own person (empathetic, sensitive). She needs Aral because she loves him but she will also fight like the proverbial lioness for him:
  ""He tried to hurt Aral through me. I found that . . . annoying. I wish you would cease trying to annoy me, Count Vordarian, I'm afraid you might succeed."" Her voice fell further, almost to a whisper. ""You should fear it, too.""
And Aral - despite being strong, honourable, strategic (as seen in the discussion about the rescue attempt), but also loving and kind - needs her just as much. The first half of the book might seem slow to some because all the political players have to be moved into position but what we read here is very important for the second half of the book (and, in fact, the rest of the series) as well as the characterization of all the secondary characters such as Bothari and Droushnakovi (what a love story THAT is with Koudelka!). So it's worth the wait and once action does happen ... phew, that was a wild ride!As usual, the author gives us an adventurous tale that hides some very deep and important topics. Such as consent (sexual as well as to medical treatments) or how a society treats physically disabled people. The latter especially since Barrayar is being portrayed like Sparta when it comes to babies and disabilities. This was a very up-to-date topic, even more so back when this was written. From a modern perspective, I have to say that I, personally, think I would probably terminate a pregnancy when being notified of my baby's disability. I know many cannot understand that but even nowadays you don't exactly live in paradise if something is wrong with you and a physical or mental disability means there is indeed something ""wrong"", even if I think we should integrate disabled people fully in any society. Thus, I think it's better to not subject my child and me/my partner to such a life (with today's technology it's also easier to spot when something is wrong).Nevertheless, I loved how Cordelia fought for Miles (against Aral's father even), succeeded, and how the young boy even manages to change his grandfather's stern mind. This is the saga of an underdog (to some extend) after all.What I probably like most about this is how the author manages to portray a topic from all kinds of angles. She shows different points of view and the readers decide which they prefer or if they would try to find a way in between even. There is also no stiffness about the characters; they can learn and evolve, change their minds, ... This makes the scenes and problems as well as the characters much more lively and 3-dimensional.",25,9
61905,Barrayar,RJ - Slayer of Trolls,729,168,1,"May 2, 2020","Let's file this Hugo Award in the ""Regrettable"" category, along with those granted to The Wanderer by Fritz Leiber and Redshirts by His Grand Snarkiness John Scalzi. In this book, newly-pregnant Cordelia Naismith of the enlightened, progressive, touchy-feely Beta Colony settles in with her new husband and prior captor (insert eye-rolling emoji here) Aral Vorkosigan on the barbaric, warmongering world of Barrayar where, tragically, no one talks about their feelings enough; it's not too hard to see the Venus/Mars female/male analogy which is thickly applied. Cordelia immediately sets about endearing herself to the locals and challenging gender stereotypes by:a) shoppingb) obsessing over wardrobe detailsc) making prego talk with other expectant mommiesd) dispensing relationship advice to everyone within earshote) complaining constantlyf) standing around while her husband does stuffCordelia is a woman of complicated feelings and impulses, and she apparently spends every waking moment in painstaking examination of same. Fortunately, she shares them all with us, in excruciating detail, for page after page after page. You'll be happy to know that everyone else around Cordelia is a complete dolt, dunce, or idiot (which gives her lots of opportunities to enlighten them) or else they are scheming would-be usurpers to the recently-vacated throne (we figure out who these are early on because they are the people Cordelia doesn't like). Don't worry about mixing up all the names, each of which starts with ""Vor,"" because they aren't much different from each other anyway. If there's anything you need to know, you can be sure that Cordelia will explain it to you at great length and with an air of bemused superiority. It should be noted that Barrayar comprises the 2nd half of the omnibus collection Cordelia's Honor, which should really be called Cordelia's Every Last Thought since that's what you'll be reading.",24,19

Christmas 2010: I realised that I had got stuck in a rut. I was re-reading old favourites again and again, waiting for a few trusted authors to release new works. Something had to be done.On the spur of the moment I set myself a challenge, to read every book to have won the Locus Sci-Fi award. That’s 35 books, 6 of which I’d previously read, leaving 29 titles by 14 authors who were new to me.While working through this reading list I got married, went on my honeymoon, switched career and became a father. As such these stories became imprinted on my memory as the soundtrack to the happiest period in my life (so far).Two books from Bujold’s epic sci-fi series, The Vorkosigan Saga, won the Locus Sci-Fi Award in the mid-90s. 
  
    Barrayar
  
 in ’92 and 
  Mirror Dance
 in ’95. Despite being published just a few years apart, within the chronology of The Vorkosigan Saga, the two stories fall at opposite ends of the spectrum – 
  
    Barrayar
  
 is (chronologically) book two of the series, and 
  Mirror Dance
 is book nine: 
  
    Barrayar
  
 focuses on Cordelia at the time of Miles’ birth, and 
  Mirror Dance
 focuses on Marc (Miles’ clone-brother) as a grown man.I think it was the names that made me initially sceptical. Vorkosigosioisi-whatsit, doesn’t exactly trip off your tongue, nor does Bararayarra. The covers looked so cheesy I thought they’d attract mice quicker than bookworms…Oh, I was such a fool! I loved 
  Mirror Dance
. It was heaps of fun! As I mentioned in my review of that book – I love long series (big fan of Discworld and Dresden Files) – so the idea of quality sci-fi series had major appeal to me. I got excited. I would’ve gladly ploughed straight into 
  
    Barrayar
  
 next, but I’d already ordered my next batch of books beforehand, so I had to blitz through Brin’s Uplift Saga trilogy first. Then I faced a dilemma – 
  
    Barrayar
  
 or Speaker for the Dead? I felt confident that Bujold would deliver, but I hadn’t yet given Card a chance – oh what a pickle!I read Speaker first, and it was good enough to stop me itching for 
  
    Barrayar
  
. But I had my happy-face on when we eventually got our time together!Someone should have warned me though – this is the story of how Cordelia, pregnant with Miles, gets hit with a ‘Soltoxin’ bio-warfare grenade in the midst of a civil war. Her and Aral (her husband) get the antidote and are fine – but not the baby. This is the book that explains Miles’ stunted growth and ‘mutie’ appearance in later books. This is not the ideal book to read when your own wife is heavily pregnant with your first child!Or maybe it is. Bujold has a couple of kids and from her writing I feel confident that she’s a great Mum – Cordelia certainly is. I think I empathised with Cordelia more than I could have before facing parenthood myself. I was trying to push my life in a new direction, to build for a family and future - and Cordelia is struggling to adapt to a new planet and culture as she plans for her family. Some of the echoes struck deep, and sometimes that made me uncomfortable. I loved 
  Mirror Dance
 as amazing, fun sci-fi. I was expecting more in that vein here – I wasn’t expecting to feel worried and aching inside.I’ve mentioned in other reviews that my best experiences with books are when they live up to and exceed my expectations. When they’re not what I expected, when I feel blindsided or ill prepared, I sometimes struggle to enjoy the immersion as much. This is one reason I used to be so cautious with new authors.
  
    Barrayar
  
 is a tremendous book. A thoughtful start, building to a gripping, page-turning climax; a wonderful grasp of characters and a tightly plotted scenario. Really, it should be a 5-star read.But because it made me feel stressed, because it made me worry about my baby – how I would feel if there was something wrong with him, something they’d missed in the scans, something they couldn’t foresee ‘till he was born – I kept jarring myself out of the story and can only give it 4-stars.I’ve since continued to read (and very much enjoy) The Vor Game, and was recently given another three Vorkosigan books for my birthday – so I shall definitely, enthusiastically, be continuing with the series.",18,4
61905,Barrayar,Althea Ann,"2,232",998,4,"December 29, 2015","The chronological sequel to 'Shards of Honor' follows Cordelia Naismith as she defects from Beta, in order to make her way to Barrayar and find her former captor Aral Vorkosigan - a man she has come to love and respect.It's not incomprehensible that her Betan psychologists assume that she must be suffering from something like Stockholm syndrome, or some more insidious mental conditioning. The suspicion cast on her means that even though the war between Beta and Barrayar is technically over, Cordelia must leave the familiar comforts of home behind and give herself fully to her new life on primitive, violent, militaristic Barrayar. Nearly immediately she finds herself plunged into the dizzying complexity of the upper levels of Barrayaran politics, as Aral discovers that the peaceful retirement he'd been planning is not in the cards for him. And that's not the only sudden change: Cordelia is pregnant.If you've read later books in this series, a great deal of this book is a lot of tension waiting for certain events that you've already read about, to happen. It's intentional on the author's part - this book involves her backtracking and filling in details about events that have already been referred to in other books. I think it would be an equally enjoyable, although different, experience to read it without already having been introduced to Miles and knowing the difficulties and circumstances surrounding his birth.",18,1 comment
61905,Barrayar,Justine,"1,103",294,4,"July 25, 2018","An excellent sequel to Shards of Honor, picking up right where things left off. At first this one moved a bit slowly for me compared to the previous book, but as always, there were many emotional and exciting incidents throughout. My favourite part comes near the end, when the intrepid Cordelia again takes charge and goes all badass on the Barrayarans.The thing I love most about her character is that she is tough when she needs to be, but inside she experiences all the doubt that any sane person would feel. It makes her extremely relatable. She also (mostly) thinks carefully before she speaks and acts, and works hard to be the person she wants to be. I loved that so much and never tired of reading about her.",18,3
61905,Barrayar,Conor,148,312,4,"December 27, 2015","Jumping around a bit in reading book 7 after book 1 in this series but it worked pretty well. This book started out brilliantly with some understated (well as understated as assassination attempts and high risk experimental surgeries can be) family turmoil, politics and character development taking center stage. While it wasn't particularly dramatic Bujold's masterful writing of interesting, nuanced characters kept me engaged. However about half-way through the focus turned into an isolated trek through the countryside that just seemed to drag on and on. And on. By the time the plot returned to the important points and characters I had grown to care about I was struggling to maintain my attention. Fortunately the conclusion was strong: exciting action and some really cool moments where we learned more about certain characters and their motivations (insights into Sergeant Bothari and how his messed up childhood led to the development of the demons that have plagued him throughout the series were especially compelling). Overall this was a good continuation to the series that has left me psyched to check out the rest of the series, especially as these first 2 books often felt like a prologue to the ""really start"" of the series with the appearance of Miles in book 2.Full review to come...",17,N/A
61905,Barrayar,Peter Tillman,"3,404",301,4,"August 7, 2021","2021 reread: held up well, and a much better novel then its predecessor, Shards of Honor. I think I'll refer you to Tadiana's first-rate review: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...I read it in the omnibus with SHARDS this time, which has the benefit of the author's interesting afterword. So if you're planning to reread (or even if you've missed the book entirely), you might look to see if your library has that edition. I had fun seeing the familiar Vorkosigan Saga characters very early in their careers, which was great. Truly, the Vorkosigan books are one of the great literary creations in SF in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This one is a strong 4 stars for me. I expect to continue with my Vorkosigan reread project. Very fine comfort-reads, by one of SF's very best writers.",16,3
61905,Barrayar,Kathleen,"1,291",29,4,"November 1, 2020","4.5 stars — it's even better on the second go-round. Chronologically, book two in this nicely-paced, militaristic space opera / romance, set centuries in the future on planets peopled by various descendants of Earth (two planets are Barrayar and Beta). I liked this book more than Shards of Honour. In sum, Cordelia and Aral Vorkosigan take no prisoners, protecting their marriage, their unborn son, and the empire.Plot, major spoilers hidden: At the end of book one, Cordelia and Aral married. Now, as this book begins, the newlyweds are living on Barrayar, where the emperor and his counts must be Vor descendants, a military caste. Cordelia misses her progressive home planet, Beta. Cordelia quickly conceives. Her pregnancy is stressful. Unknown enemies make several attempts on their lives, because her husband, a Vor lord and war hero, has been named Regent of Barrayar, running the empire till little Gregor, turning five years old, grows up.The love between Cordelia and Aral is tested several times and trust deepens. Tragedy occurs, causing their growing fetus to develop brittle bones, easily broken. Cordelia kicks asparagus in this story. While Aral is busy overthrowing a political coup, she takes on all comers to protect her fetus, Miles, growing in a replicator, vulnerable to kidnapping and murder. Her mama-bear instincts might potentially result in a killing spree. She could do it, too, with lethal and loyal Bothari at her side.SPOILER:Key dialogue, at the resolution (major spoiler!!)  “Count Piotr’s hand slapped down hard upon the table. “Good God, woman, where have you been?” he cried furiously.A morbid lunacy overtook her. She smiled fiercely at him, and held up the bag. “Shopping.”For a second, the old man nearly believed her; conflicting expressions whiplashed over his face, astonishment, disbelief, then anger as it penetrated he was being mocked.“Want to see what I bought?” Cordelia continued, still floating. She yanked the bag’s top open, and rolled Vordarian’s head out across the table. Fortunately, it had ceased leaking some hours back. It stopped faceup before him, lips grinning, drying eyes staring.Piotr’s mouth fell open. Kanzian jumped, the staffers swore, and one of Vordarian’s traitors actually fell out of his chair, recoiling. Vortala pursed his lips and raised his brows. Koudelka, grimly proud of his key role in stage-managing this historic moment in one-upsmanship, laid the swordstick on the table as further evidence. Illyan puffed, and grinned triumphantly through his shock.Aral was perfect. His eyes widened only briefly, then he rested his chin on his hands and gazed over his father’s shoulder with an expression of cool interest. “But of course,” he breathed. “Every Vor lady goes to the capital to shop.”(Refers to when Cordelia, aided by Drou and Bothari, beheads and bags ""the pretender"" (ersatz emperor Vordarian ) while rescuing her baby, Miles, growing in the replicator. Meanwhile, Kou is sneaking Lady Alys and baby Ivan to safety.) . Some dialogue feels canned,  as in this eye-rolling moment: Here is Vorkosigan, utterly grief stricken and enraged at an act that nearly cost him his entire family, and did cause irreparable damage. Just minutes later, he addresses the attacker in over-the-top language, smacking of a prepared speech: ""Did you dream of sweet revenge? You have it. So eat vengeance. Drink it. Fondle it. Wrap it round you in the night watch. It's all yours. I will it all to you. For myself, I've gorged it to the gagging point, and have lost my stomach for it."" (He is shellshocked? No way.)  Secondary characters:  It was good to see so much of Lieutenant Koudelko (aka Kou, injured so badly in Shards) and Sargeant Bothari, the much-abused ""monster"" who has formed such an attachment to kindly Cordelia. These two men add so much to the story! I sympathize with and admire them. Plus, I never know quite what to expect. They are wildcards, to some extent. Sequels:  The stage is now set for about a dozen sequels about their incredible son Miles and his fabulous friends. At the end of this book, Cordelia charges Aral (the acting Regent) to ""Remake this world into one Miles can survive in. And Elena. And Ivan. And Gregor."" In the epilogue, we see Miles at about age five. Little rascal.I listened to the Blackstone Audio app.  The narration is decent, but not outstanding. A male voice, deep and gravely. Given the 3rd-person POV was mainly the heroine's, a female voice would have served better, IMO. ________About the series: The Vorkosigan Saga is space opera with some romantic bits here and there. As science fiction it's not outstanding, but just fine. The sci-fi elements involve advanced biomedical technology, including cloning and other types of genetic engineering (no longer fiction). The series contrasts the militaristic, intolerant, feudal planet of Barrayar against the enlightened and generally progressive planet of Beta Colony. This cultural dichotomy is fairly suspect, but interesting. It serves a purpose. Bujold does a nice job with characterization and plot development. Her pacing is good, too. I enjoy the series.=======  My reviews of this series (*favorites):  Shards of Honor review*Barrayar review*The Warrior's Apprentice reviewThe Vor Game reviewCetaganda reviewThe Mountains of Mourning reviewLabyrinth review*Borders of Infinity reviewBrothers in Arms reviewMirror Dance review*Memory review*Miles in Love: Komarr, A Civil Campaign, Winterfair Gifts review*Komarr reviewDiplomatic Immunity reviewCaptain Vorpatril's Alliance reviewCryoburn review",15,17
61905,Barrayar,Milda Page Runner,297,235,3,"March 29, 2017","3.5* Similar to previous book the first half is slower – mainly focussing on family melodrama and politics with a few assassination attempts to spice things up. Half way though pacing changes dramatically and then we get all the action and suspense one could hope for from the book. Cordelia shines in it. Whilst I loved second part of this book I also had few issues with this instalment. With all the time spent on Barrayar it becomes obvious that Barrayar is remarkably similar to Earth. The same green vegetation, the same types of landscape, even temperatures and seasons are the same. We also have (imported) horses and people burn wood in the fireplaces… Normally I expect more imagination and variety from my sci-fi/space opera.Secondly I couldn’t help but notice that most of their issues (Koudelka’s physical and Sergant Bothari mental state, Cordelia’s disruptor damaged leg and worries about present state, birth and child) could have been solved by hiring a doctor or two from more technologically advanced planet along with the better medical equipment. Not beyond possibilities for Emperor’s Regent I should think.Despite these issues I have enjoyed this read and even found it hard to put down halfway in. Whilst it is slightly weaker than the previous book it truly feels 3.5* and I would happily recommend to space opera fans.",15,3
