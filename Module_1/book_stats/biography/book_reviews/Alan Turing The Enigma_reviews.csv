150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,B Schrodinger,305,642,4,"October 2, 2021","Let me introduce you to Alan. He is a quiet and shy man, but one who mainly gets along with his colleagues. He is determined to tackle large questions and finds that his understanding of mathematics and logic can be applied to aspects of the universe around him, especially in areas that people would deem too messy and without any logic. He is a great proponent of going back to first principles when approaching problems also.This book has been on my radar for years now. I found it after one of those tipping points where you finally hit the nth reference to a person or idea and you find your ignorance about it embarrassing. By the way I find that these instances only increase with the more you act upon them. Ignorance really is bliss. Anyway, along comes the film starring Sherlock himself and I found myself highly entertained by the story and wanting to know more. So it was time to tackle this volume and I chose to tackle it by audiobook.Firstly I want to cover the book and it's difference to the movie, because looking at the words on the print cover, ""The Book That Inspired the Film 'The Imitation Game'"", it leads you to a sense that a biopic from a biography should be fairly accurate. It seems that the movie took a lot of liberties and while there were not many huge outright lies, there were plenty of distortions, simplifications and exaggerations. There is a little part of me that is offended, but there is another larger part of me that is not surprised. Alan Turing was not a stereotypical genius nerd in a world that did not appreciate him. He did have a huge battle to overcome adversity due to his work being outlandish and misunderstood. It seems like Hollywood latches onto the 'Beautiful Mind' + Sheldon Cooper cookie cutter a little too much. I feel that I should also say that I did enjoy the movie. As far as movies go it was entertaining and also a bit educational. But I guess going into this book I expected a bit more continuity. Cumberbatch's Turing is not Hodge's biography Turing.Hodge's biography offers a traditional chronological look at Turing's life, from a short section on his lineage to his cremation on the last page. But there is a lot more in here than what you would bargain for. Turing's work and the work leading up it is is explained in great detail. Using the term 'in depth' may be a gross under- exaggeration. There is also a large section focused upon the laws concerning 'perversion' at the time, which Turing was convicted for. If you were to remove the sections concerning math, engineering and law you'll find a book that weighs only a small percentage of the original. I guess what I am trying to say is that this book is not for the layman. I can only imagine that there will be a lot of copies of this book abandoned on planes, trains and bookshelves because a fan of the movie picked this book up wanting to know more, just like I did. The large sections on mathematical logic I did follow the gist of somewhat, helped along by my greater understanding of maths than the average person. Large sections of this book would only be completely understandable by people with degrees in mathematics. I chose more mathematics subjects in my science degree than the norm, so I have some sense of what is going on in these passages. I pity anyone trying to make it through without some knowledge of this type of maths. If you are a person who hates 'info-dumps' you are going to loathe this book.But on the positive side, this was the right book at the right time for the right person. I have often found that there is no better way to learn about a person than to find the highest rated biography of that person on Goodreads that is at least 500 pages long. I have been stung with too many shorter biographies that leave me unsatisfied and finding out more information on the person's Wikipedia page. I wanted to know more about Turing and my god I found out a whole lot more.Of course it's not all about volume. Both the writer and narrator kept me entertained for just over 30 hours. The writer was sympathetic to his subject and yet portrayed his great failings also. I really do feel that I met a person who I can call a hero (I hate that word and I am sure that there is a far greater compliment). Turing had great determination, a high regard for the truth in his work and personal life, and a scientific approach to everything he undertook. He may be known as being a mathematician, but he was an even greater scientist who straddled fields in a time when fields were clearly defined. He often found that there was no perfect audience for his papers and that some fields would only appreciate some aspects, while other parts would not be understood at all. He was converging the sciences with mathematics.So despite all the negatives that I noted earlier, for me not only a book to be treasured, but an introduction to a man that is greatly misunderstood and hugely under-appreciated. I want a portrait of him up on my wall alongside my Darwin portrait. I am going to get my hands on some of his writing and try to get my head around more of the maths.",108,24
150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,Mara,400,274,5,"June 7, 2017","Alan Turing 23 June, 1912 - 7 June, 1954Proximate Cause & Goodness of FitI'm not too proud to admit that the impetus for my picking up this biography was a trailer for the upcoming film on 
  Alan Turing
 and his involvement with cracking the Enigma code during WWII (
  
    The Imitation Game
  
). However, if you are interested exclusively (or even primarily) in the cryptanalytic exploits of Turing et al. at 
  Bletchley Park
 then this is probably not — repeat 
  not
 the Turing book for you. While 
  
    Andrew Hodges
  
 thoroughly covers Turing's activities during the Second World War, this is just one piece of the whole. As one might expect of a book with an introduction by 
  
    Douglas Hofstadter,
  
 it is an examination of both function and form. Alan's experiences were what they were because of who he was, and, in turn, these experiences made him into the man, the enigma he became.
  
The Young Turing MachineAndrew Hodges, and Henrik Olesen, the artist behind 
  ""Some Illustrations to the Life of Alan Turing,""
 both depict the young Alan Turing as a child inquisitive, and bright beyond his years. Alan, even in his earliest years, exhibited what Hodges refers to as a ""desert island"" mentality. If Alan had a problem, he relied on his own ingenuity to find an answer (e.g. inventing a machine to count gear revolutions and make adjustments as needed for his broken bicycle chain). 
  
The young genius mind, however, outside of a vacuum, does not necessarily coalesce easily with the world around it. This was certainly true of Alan's early experiences in the 
  English public school
 environment.* Alan was what some might refer to as ""extremely pick-on-able."" Thus, when he received a copy of Edwin Tenney Brewster's 
  
    Natural Wonders Every Child Should Know
  
 on behalf of an unnamed benefactor in 1922, Alan was undoubtedly relieved to be able to escape into a world of science, numbers and natural order. Brewster portrayed the human body as a machine; one with duties, tasks, functions, and, perhaps more importantly, one that could be understood through the faculties of reason. Obedience to Authority & The Imitation GameIn 1926, at the age of 13, Alan (left, below) was sent to the 
  Sherborne School
. With an emphasis good citizenship, and the individual's duty to fit into the system of their small society for the greater good (none of which included becoming a ""man of science), Sherborne was not a good fit for Alan. 
  
However, things began to turn around for Alan in 1928, when he met 
  Christopher Morcom.
 Morcom, one year ahead of Alan at Sherburn and a member of a different ""house,"" shared Alan's passion for science, maths, and exploration of the natural world. Unlike Alan, however, Morcom was able to integrate these interests with scholastic success.
  
The letters between Alan and Christopher during vacations from Sherborne are filled with an excited energy that comes with having someone with whom to share new discoveries. Christopher was both Alan's mentor and, as portrayed by Hodges, his first love. It's not clear whether this intimacy between the two was physical in nature, but the magnitude of Christopher's place in Alan's heart was made acutely and painfully clear when Christopher died suddenly of bovine tuberculosis in 1930.
  
The letters between Christopher Morcom's mother and Alan (a correspondence that continued for many years) reflect their shared grief in losing Christopher. The experience changed Alan in many ways, including a renewed dedication to honoring Christopher's memory by pursuing the interests they had shared (which, despite their youth, had included quantum physics, and Einstein's 
  
    Relativity: The Special and the General Theory
  
). An Ordinary English Homosexual Atheist MathematicianThough, unlike Christopher, Alan did not win a scholarship to his first choice, Trinity, he was admitted and matriculated to 
  King's College, Cambridge
 in 1931. Though Alan remained secluded at King's, he was well-suited to its norms. In addition to the academic caliber of his professors and classmates, it was a socially and politically liberal environment; and it was in this context, that Alan became somewhat matter-of-factly open in his homosexuality. Not knowing much about Cambridge (or really any university) in the 1940s, I was not clear as to whether Hodges' references to the life of an ""ordinary english homosexual..."" were made in jest. However, though Hodges is clear that this was not an easy life, it seems that it was much easier in the context of King's College. Decidability, Computability & the EntscheidungsproblemIt is because of my own descriptive shortcomings that I won't be saying much about the content of the foundational problems (and paradoxes) in math and logic being asked and addressed by Turing and his contemporaries in the 1920s and 1930s. Suffice it to say that if you're operating under the impression that any system of mathematical logic can be complete, consistent and decidable, you might want to take a gander at some of 
  
    Kurt Gödel's
  
 early work, and Turing's 
  
    On Computable Numbers
  
 (though some might direct you toward the papers of 
  Alonzo Church
). Before you say, ‘well who cares?’ Let it be known that the very notion of ""computability"" (in a time when what was meant by ""computer"" is akin to what we think of as a ""writer"" - one doing the writing/one doing the computing) was new. Furthermore, this was the point at which Turing made a huge leap in the conceptual connection between 
  abstract symbols and the physical world. 
  Like Schrödinger's cat, the 
  Universal Turing Machine
 was a thought experiment, the elegance of which lies in its simplicity. Turing's conception (based on the idea of a typewriter) is that there is a machine that has a 
  tape
, which is divided into 
  squares
. Each square can bear a 
  symbol.
 At a any given moment, one square is ""in the machine,"" this is the 
  scanned square,
 and it bears the
   scanned symbol. 

  
Doesn't sound like much, I know, but here's the thing: the 
  state
 of the machine (with its finite table of actions) can be determined by a singly expression using the symbols (which can be limited to two)...and there's 
  recursion.
 It makes more sense if you read it from the experts! To Oz and BackIt's the mid-1930s at this point, and 
  Princeton
 is a pretty happening place. Turing, offered a fellowship there, crossed the pond to work with 
  John von Neumann
 (who Hodges likens to the Wizard of Oz). Things just didn't work out as planned. Princeton was the height of wealth and aristocratic excess from Turing's point of view, and Turing was proving again the difference between having brilliant ideas and impressing them on the world. However, Turing did have a good time at Princeton when taking part in ""treasure hunts"" consisting of series of encrypted clues. So, when Turing turned down a position at Princeton, and went back to Cambridge in 1938, his experiences stateside came in handy. The Enigma & Bletchley ParkPrior to Britain's declaration of war, Alan Turing was (surprisingly) the first and only mathematician recruited to work at the super secret 
  Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS)
, and later moved to the cryptanalytic HQ at 
  Bletchley Park
. Alan, who had long dreamed of a chess-playing machine, suddenly had a practical problem for his obsession. 
  
    “Before the war my work was in logic and my hobby was cryptanalysis, and now it is the other way round.”
  
 How so? Well, von Neumann's theory of 
  ‘minimax’
 strategies (the application of probabilities to any game between two players such that one chooses the “least bad” option) — one of making decisions in the absence of perfect information, had direct applications in strategic combat. And, of course there was decryption of Enigma messages to be done. Alan's ability (and desire) to bridge the gap between mathematics and engineering was, for the first time, seen by others as an asset. Turing's thought experiments were being translated into actual electronic machinery—
  the Bombe 
(below), and 
  the Colossus
. 
  
To be clear, it was the Bombe that was used to crack the Enigma. However, the Colossus was the first computer that approached Turing's conception of ""universality"" in that it was 
  programmable
. Many of those working at Bletchley were 
  Wrens
 (seen below with the Colossus), members of the Women's Royal Naval Service. For Turing this was his first contact with women, including 
  Joan Clarke
. The two were briefly engaged, but this was broken off in 1941 when Turing informed Clarke of his homosexuality.
  
The Heart in ExileTuring had been afforded more freedom during the war than he, perhaps, realized at the time. At the 
  National Physical Laboratory
 (NPL) Turing completed the design for an 
  Automatic Computing Engine 
(ACE), but in the face of bureaucracy and departmental divisiveness, he had almost no control over its engineering and construction. 
  
 
  
    “Alan Turing might be Valiant-for-Truth, but even he had been led into the work of deception by science, and by sex into lying to the police.”
  
 Outside of the cloistered world of Cambridge, England was not exactly gay-friendly (didn't Oscar Wilde get hard labor for that?). In ""exile"" in Manchester, our ordinary English homosexual atheist, when burgled by the friends of a young man he brought home, reported the larceny to the police. However, by engaging in such “sexual perversion,” Turing had placed himself outside of the protection of the law. Turing was sentenced not to prison, but 
  chemical castration
 by estrogen injections. America was no better (just ask Lou Reed—his parents sent him for electroshock therapy, and that was for bisexuality). Having decided that homosexuals presented a “security risk,” Turing was banned from the United States as a whole. In a twisted, endless loop, intolerance for homosexuality put any homosexual at risk for blackmail, which, in turn, made homosexuals a security risk, thereby increasing the intolerance with which we began. On June 8th, 1954 Alan Turing was found dead in his home, lying in his bed. The identified the cause as 
  cyanide poisoning,
 and the post-mortem inquest easily ruled it a suicide. In his house they found a jar of potassium cyanide, and a jam jar of cyanide solution. Next to his bed was a half-eaten apple.

150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,Diane in Australia,668,786,5,"March 29, 2018","I loved this book. I was almost afraid to read it after others said how difficult it was to understand the math sections, but I found those to be fascinating. If math had been taught this way in my schools, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I even read some of the maths bits to my husband!As to Turing's life, I very much enjoyed reading about that, too. I wish I had known him. The way his mind works just took my breath away. I found myself going back over paragraphs, just to make certain I would always remember his ideas, and the way he expressed them.The book covers his entire life ... birth to death ... not just the code breaking days of WWII. Not only is he considered a pioneer of computer science, and artificial intelligence, but he dabbled in physics, quantum mechanics, biology, chemistry, and neurology, too. In 1952, his work on morphogenesis became a completely new field of mathematical biology.I can certainly relate to his personality quirks. I seem to have quite a few of the same ones. Nice to know I'm in such good company. Of course, he didn't see them as 'quirks', and neither do I.As to his death, well, there has always been two schools of thought about what really happened. Either way, it was just tragic to lose his great mind, and honest heart.The amount of research the author conducted was amazing. He really worked hard to bring so many resources together for our enjoyment. Andrew wrote, ""If this book is truly a biography - a writing of life, not a collection of facts - then it is because people have been prepared to allow that interference, and to entrust me with words and ideas that still have living force."" (675)Some may find the math bits too dreary, or feel the book is too long, but I am not one of them. It changed my way of looking at certain things. It touched me on a intellectual level, and an emotional one. As I said, I loved it. If you're not 'into' math, you can skim those parts, and still enjoy the rest of Alan's interesting life.5 Stars = It made a significant impact on my heart, and/or mind. It moved me. I won't forget it.",39,11
150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,Will Ansbacher,296,85,5,"November 28, 2016","To read this is to feel humbled, not just by Alan Turing’s brilliant mind, but also by the years of dedicated work that Andrew Hodges put into this biography. At 700-plus pages, including a massive number of footnotes and references which are themselves a fund of fascinating information, it is dense going however, and probably not for everyone, although I found it totally absorbing**. Here finally (well, not really “finally” as it was written in 1983) was someone who could explain Turing’s universal machine and his theory of computable numbers. (Not that I'm sure I understood it, but Hodges’ explanations are lucid – unlike Dyson’s muddled and waffly  Turing’s Cathedral that I once mistakenly thought was this book.) Turing was a strange, contradictory character, a shy and bumbling academic but at the same time quite unlike the academic stereotype: as a mathematician, he was so isolated from his peers that he would often formulate “new” theorems unaware that they had already been discovered; but as a result, his methods were idiosyncratic and unconventional, and often led to truly new insights. His expertise covered a huge range –everything he did had to have some practical application, yet he was the most impractical and disorganized person himself. His prime fascination was the brain - to make a mechanical model of its logical functions, and the question of whether machines could be made to think. To this end he proposed the criterion of the “imitation game”, where if one could not tell whether responses to questions were from a human or a (hidden) machine, one should consider the machine as behaving like a human. To be capable of “thinking”, however, the machine would also have to learn, independently of its programs, and Turing formulated what he considered appropriate learning schemes. But here’s the thing – he did not seem to consider the essential need of humans to communicate with each other and interact with their environment as significant to learning and development; “I think of people as pink-coloured sense data”, he said supposedly in jest, but I thought that there was a significant truth there. It all makes me wonder if Turing was not somewhere on the autistic spectrum. Although this is not something that Hodges speculates about, Turing did indeed feel his own life was something of a imitation game.He was most famous of course for his brilliant work at Bletchley during WW2 in cracking the Enigma codes, and Hodges places him very well at the centre of the decryption effort – but at the same time on the periphery, surprisingly, of the actual development of the Colossus which was the actual precursor of the computer. (This was because computers as such didn’t interest him at all; it was getting them to “think” that was the challenge). After WW2, he was involved with two projects, one was the paper design for the ACE computer, the other in programming the first actual computer (at Manchester, some time before the more famous ENIAC was completed in the US). His involvement wasn’t exactly peripheral, but he gradually lost interest in it as its limitations became apparent for the cybernetic research he wanted to perform. Turing was also a homosexual at a time when that was considered an unspeakable depravity and at best an illness. That certainly contributed to the isolation he felt for most of his life, although he wasn’t at all reticent about his orientation either – in that he was a man well before his time. It’s commonly thought that he committed suicide following a conviction for “indecent” activities, but Hodges makes it clear that the two events weren’t connected, as he had put that episode well behind him two years earlier. What Hodges does very well, in an extended analysis, is place Turing’s death in the context of Britain’s panic over blackmail, homosexuals and spies in the secret services. This was around 1953-4 when the atomic bomb was being developed, and Burgess, McLean and others had defected with both British and US secrets. Hodges doesn’t speculate on whether there was any actual government approach to Turing in that context, but it would have been clear to him that he would have been considered an even greater risk, as during the war he had been privy to the innermost secrets of both countries concerning Enigma - and compared to the atomic program (which at least was known to exist), that remained absolutely secret and unmentionable for another 20 years. So it’s likely that Turing recognized the hopeless position he was trapped in, with nobody to turn to for advice or help.I’m not summarizing this very well, but Hodges does an impassioned and admirable job. A couple of things, however, that I would knock this bio for: first, his tendency not to put rather peripheral events in context (incidents in WW2 that didn’t relate directly to Bletchley or Turing, for example). This is all a bit surprising as Hodges is not some historian assuming a bit too much inside knowledge from his audience, but a physicist and mathematician much like Turing himself. And, I have to mention Hodges’ rather outlandish overuse of allusion and metaphor, mostly from The Wizard of Oz  and  Alice in Wonderland . They can be quite obscure, as in: “Half desired, half dreaded, was the reappearance of the Monstrous Crow, currently flapping ambiguously on the other side of the Atlantic.”  or: “Yet in reaching the niente of his Sinfonia Antartica, he kept as close to his vision as the exigencies of the world allowed.”  (yes, that’s Vaughn Williams, but I’m not a lot wiser) and: “more the ITMA professor than eminent authority”  ... well, if it hadn’t been for my mother telling me about It’s That Man Again, the wartime radio program that inspired the Goon Show, I would not have had a clue what that meant. (She could do mean renderings of ITMA catch-phrases like “... he’s fallen in the waar-tah!”, by the way!)But this is really minor carping about style. And I should also say that it’s not necessary to understand any mathematics at all to read and enjoy this book; you can simply skip those details and be totally absorbed - for a very long time!_________** though do NOT read this on an e-book if you are at all like me and obsessively read every note and reference!

150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,Becky,"1,308",1595,2,"June 16, 2021","This is one of those books that I'm really torn on how to rate. On the one hand, I think it was really well and meticulously researched, but on the other hand, it kinda felt like I was experiencing his life in real time through this audio. It was SO very long. SO detailed. A lot of this book went well over my head. The math, the science, the engineering, the cryptology, the theoretical concepts... I love these things, but that doesn't mean I UNDERSTAND them. I completely admit that I let most of it just wash over me. I listened, but I didn't really try to understand the concepts that were difficult for other fully trained mathematicians to grasp. Plus, as fascinating as I found what he did - I wasn't here for that. I was here for him. And I found him utterly fascinating. The aspects of Turing's life outside of the technical and mathematical, particularly his homosexuality... that I could definitely understand and truly loved reading about. And that's what let me down the most in this book at the end and had me making stinkface for the last hour and a half of the audio. We learn, through the course of this book, that Alan was pretty open about who he was. He lived on his own terms, and his sexuality was a sort of open secret. He didn't FLAUNT it, but neither was he ashamed of it, despite the laws around homosexuality being what they were at the time (fucking ignorant and ridiculous if you ask me, but nobody did, so I'm just saying it anyway). He was a unique thinker, and kind of aloof, socially. He was interested in ideas and things and information and concepts much more than he was people. He had trouble really connecting with people or meeting them on their level - he always expected them to come to his level. He didn't really understand the social risks he ran by being who he was... but even when he found out about those risks, was arrested and tried and convicted of ""sexual deviancy"", and was dealing with the repercussions of that, including telling his family, friends, co-workers and colleagues about his ""crime"" and conviction, and then undergoing chemical castration, he stayed true to himself and went on with his life, sans shame, sans guilt, sans any sense of moral wrongdoing. He kept working, he kept ""having tea"" with men, he kept running, he kept calm and carried on, as the saying goes. And so, it irked the absolute shit out of me that this book upheld the coroner's conclusion that he committed suicide. I didn't know him. I know nothing more than what was in this book, but even based on that, I disagree with this book's agreement with that conclusion and I think it's bullshit. I see no evidence that would support Alan Turing killing himself. What I do see here, and what has me annoyed as fuck, is a marked attempt to frame some very inconsequential things as ""evidence"" of that conclusion. For instance, Turing was a long-distance runner. He ran regularly, trained for and ran in marathons, and even came close to qualifying for the Olympics at one point... but near the end of the book, this running was framed as his attempt to ""distance himself"" or run away from the aspects of himself that he couldn't avoid - IE: his sexuality. I'm sorry fucking what?Or, Alan's reading of the book Finistère, which deals with homosexuality in a fatalistic and hopeless way, and ends with suicide. Turing read this book a year before his death, but it's presented in such a way by Hodges as to imply that Finistère made such an impact, that it influenced him so deeply, that he poisoned himself. A year later. Right. This influence of literature is sprinkled throughout the book, quite a lot. Alice in Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass were referenced repeatedly, Alan was several times referenced as ""Caliban on his island"", etc... This was an ongoing theme, and I didn't really understand why until after the Finistère revelation, and then I got pretty angry, because it seemed to imply that his reading of literature held SUCH POWER over him that it impacted his actual life, to the extent that if a gay character felt hopeless and committed suicide, Alan Turing would do the same. And not only that, but the well-known habit of his eating an apple before bed was then morphed into some Snow White ""poison apple"" nonsense, and it's even mentioned that ""nobody recognized the symbolism"" of the half-eaten apple when he was found. Are you fucking kidding me with this? Hodges dismisses the possibility of his death being accidental, even while listing out all of the exceedingly reasonable and rational and very logical reasons that it would be, all of the evidence that he had every intention of continuing work and social obligations and such, and while listing out all of the areas that a complete lack of evidence exists FOR his committing suicide. I mean, the man was growing breasts from the chemical castration ""treatment"" of his ""sexual deviancy"" for TWO YEARS at that point and laughed about it. But SUUURE. He totally offed himself because a book told him to. I cannot roll my eyes harder at this. Oh wait, maybe it was because a fortune teller told him to. His family crest/motto included the word fortune, so that completely checks out. Mystery solved. It couldn't POSSSSSIBLY be that he had installed a chemical lab in his apartment and was notoriously lax about safety or cleaning his hands after dealing with chemicals... like potassium cyanide that he was using to plate gold onto spoons. It couldn't POSSSSSSSSSSSSSIBLY be that he either accidentally ingested cyanide or inhaled fumes from the process. Nah. Totally he was re-enacting Snow White. For sure. This taints the entire book for me, which up until that point was in 4-star territory. But this... No. Honestly, this does SUCH a huge disservice to Alan Turing's memory that it actually ruins the rest of it for me. The last hour of the book being a full essay about how homosexuality was viewed as a security risk to the military and government, and how the stigma of homosexuality was perfect fodder for spies to use as blackmail... but DOESN'T make the logical leap of DESTIGMATIZATION solving all of the fucking problems... that doesn't help either. I wanted to love this. I knew a little bit about Alan Turing, and learning more about him was fascinating and awesome. I think I would have liked him, if he deigned to talk to me. (I'm not up to his level. He's somewhere up around Everest and I'm in the Everglades.) But the end of this book was a bunch of bullshit, and I really disagreed with and detested the way it framed his death and the circumstances around it. On the plus side, Britain admitted they fucked up with their treatment of Turing and pardoned him posthumously in 2009. But that wasn't in this book, so Hodges gets no extra credit rating boost from it. 2 stars is probably being generous for how pissy I feel about Hodges' complete garbage framing of Turing's death, but the rest of the book was well researched and thorough and interesting, so... fine. 2 stars.",19,N/A

The book is quite lengthy. I feel that some digressions into the politics at his boarding school, for example, weren't worth diving into to explain the effect it had on his presence there. Hodges also employs this extended mixed metaphor intertwining Alice in Wonderland (apropos), Wizard of Oz (less so), among others. Not sure it helped to continue referring to the Red and White Queens etc.But apart from that, this was a great read. Very full picture of Turing's life, public and private (and it was mostly private), from troubles as a schoolboy, his sexuality, his codebreaking during WWII, groundbreaking work toward modern computing, and his eventual academic fading, conviction for 'indecency' and sudden suicide.Few minor bugs, not really worth noting, though surprised they haven't been removed in subsequent editions (book was published in the eighties, right?)",16,2

Alan Turing lived in and around Wilmslow. I grew up in Poynton, just a handful of miles from Wilmslow. Can you see where I am going with this? HOWEVER, I used my mathematics to write computer programs (and deserted that after a few years) whereas Alan Turing invented computers and computer programming. I finished my marathons in the middle of the pack whereas Alan Turing was up the front, almost appearing at the Olympic Games at one stage. There is no blue plaque in Poynton with my name on it. In short Alan Turing was a genius and I am not.I read this book partly motivated by a desire to learn more about Turing to help me understand more of Will Eaves’ book Murmur, but also because Turing has long been a hero of mine so it was a perfect opportunity to find out more. I discovered that I had known more about Turing’s life than I had thought, but less about his work. This book covers both in detail.This is a difficult book to read from a 2018 perspective. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, we take so much for granted today in the world of computing. Most of us casually carry around in our pockets more computing power than was available to the Apollo astronauts as they travelled to the moon and back and we rely on the Internet more than we probably care to admit. It is therefore sometimes hard to imagine a world in which there was not a single computer until Alan Turing invented them. The technical details of Turing’s work that are discussed are not easy to understand. I found myself scouring my brain for remnants of my maths degree and, mostly, failing to find anything helpful. The discussions of pure mathematics, logic and cryptography are complex. You have been warned!The second reason this is a difficult book to read relates to another fundamental difference between me and Alan Turing. I am heterosexual and he was homosexual. Reading from a 2018 perspective, a person’s sexual orientation would not be a big deal, but in Turing’s life time it was: if a man was caught putting his homosexual desires into practice, he was breaking the law and would be punished. As is well known, this is exactly what happened to Turing. Reading the homophobic attitudes of society and of several individuals is very uncomfortable. It is unpleasant to be reminded that my country was once like that.The book takes us from Turing’s ancestry all the way through to his death (it is still not 100% clear whether it was suicide or a careless accident). It is over 700 pages long. And yet the man himself manages to remain something of an enigma (deliberate pun).With so few messages from the unseen mind to work on, his inner code remains unbroken. According to his imitation principle, it is quite meaningless to speculate upon his unspoken thoughts. Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen. But Alan Turing could not possess the philosopher’s detachment from life. It was, as the computer might put it, the unspeakable that left him speechless.Turing was undoubtedly a genius. And his work was of major significance. The Wikipedia page for him includes the phrase…but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives. Not only did he contribute in a major way to the war effort, but he also is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.With the caveat that many pages of this book are difficult to read because of their mathematical nature, this is required reading for anyone who wants to try to understand one of the greatest minds of the twentieth century.",13,N/A
150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,Traci Haley,"1,409",16,4,"October 9, 2014","This biography was a struggle to get through. I picked it up in audiobook form in anticipation of The Imitation Game hitting theaters this fall. I didn't immediately realise how long and thorough it would be, though I knew I was venturing into a topic I knew very little about.Here's the thing -- the parts of this biography that deal with Alan Turing's personal life are EXTREMELY interesting and well researched. I loved how detailed they were and found it a fascinating portrait of a man I knew very little about. But a great deal of this biography also delved into detailed descriptions of Alan Turing's experiments and inventions, of which I understood almost nothing. I found myself glazing over for big chunks of the book while the author described the different types of codebreaking techniques. I know they were absolutely relevant, but they got so technical that someone like me, with very little ability in math or computer sciences, couldn't make heads nor tails of what was being talked about.That being said, the story of Alan Turing's life was interesting enough that I kept going through all 30+ hours of the audiobook and I *really* enjoyed the parts that I could understand. The last 3 hours of the audiobook were, in particular, heartbreaking to listen to. The way Turing was treated and the way he ended his life was a terrible, terrible tragedy. It's only a small comfort that we've made tiny strides in gay and lesbian rights -- though the fact that that topic is still a hot debate is shameful.So despite my boredom through some of this biography, I have to rate it highly because it was incredibly well-written when it came to getting a portrait of Turing's life. I am really looking forward to seeing The Imitation Game and watching this incredible life take form on the big screen.",12,9

150731,Alan Turing The Enigma,Nooilforpacifists,856,34,4,"March 15, 2016","Ponderous in places, fast moving in others, this is the best attempt to capture Turing the man and mathematician. Always awkward; always shy in social situations, he grew to be ""a man with a quite powerful build, yet with with the movements of an ' undergraduate' or a 'boy', without an attractive face.A scholarship boy to a ""public (i.e., private) school"", Turing suffered the humiliations familiar (since Arnold's day) to any boy who was a loner and terrible at team sports. He hero worshiped (and more) a classmate who encouraged him to study for entrance to Cambridge; Turing, fatefully as it turned out, was admitted to Kings College, Cambridge -- his school chum having died of TB in the interim. A degree followed, where Turing produced his only real scholarly paper, ""On Computable Numbers"", where he became the first person to imagine a computer. Alan was rewarded by a Kings Fellowship and a one-year Fellowship at Princeton (amidst the great and the greater, yet, on the whole, Alan was too shy to interact with Einstein, or any of the others -- neither public school, nor Cambridge nor Princeton deflected Alan from being ""a confirmed solitary.""How much this has to do with being a homosexual is unknown--Turing was remarkably frank about disclosing that fact to his friends. In the end, it proved his undoing.In any event, the war intervened, and Alan was spirited to Bletchley Park. Although Alan had no talent for management or personnel (nor the inclination to spend any precious time on either), he did, singularly, have the ability to see the big picture when it came to the Nazi's toughest code, the Naval Enigma. That required a limited sub-set of a Universal Turing machine (capable of understanding all instructions it read), but Turing was better than anyone else. And when he thought his department wasn't getting sufficient resources, he wrote to Churchill himself to clear the blockage. So Britain wins the war--but loses the peace. The economy is in terrible shape for almost a decade; the Empire is dismembered; and Britain becomes the junior partner in the ""special relationship"" with America. Alan meanwhile, chose one of three government posts offered to build this ""electronic brain"" he promises. But he chooses poorly, and none of the three really see that it is both a mathematical as well as an engineering challenge--whereas Alan had been working with actual machinery since Bletchley Park days, and knew the two had to be combined. But his social awkwardness prevents him from making the point, and little progress is made.Alan kept to his principles throughout his life, and he became especially open about his homosexuality after the war. So much so that, when he was burglarized by the friend of a boy he'd picked up, he called the police, not realizing that as a ""sex criminal"", he was outside the law himself. The burglary was of little interest to the police, but a sex criminal with secrets was. Burgess and MacLean -- also from Kings College, and also homosexuals -- just had defected, astonishing the Brits, who had assumed the ""old school tie"" was a sufficient security check. So Turing was convicted of the unspeakable crime, and sentenced not to jail but to chemical castration via estrogen treatments. Which suppressed libido, and made him grow breasts. But Truing's treatment was a year's complete--when he committed suicide by eating a cyanide-poisoned apple at his home. Why then, his friends wondered--""his death came as a shock to those who knew him. . . The trial was two years in the past, the hormone treatments had ended a year before, and he seemed to have risen above it all.""There is no proof, but the reason is either Turing understood, or the British MI6 told him, that he could never work on important government projects anymore. ""[T]here was a solid logic to the mind of security, one that could not be expected to take an interest in notions of freedom of development. He had no right to such things, as he would be first to admit. . . [W]hen it came to questions that mattered, there was no doubt he had placedhimself under military law."" Without access to the latest information about computers, without contact with his American peers, and with probable termination of his government contracts, Alan Turing was to be placed in a position where his mind was not free to do the work he wanted. Writing to Churchill wasn't going to help this time--so suicide seemed the sole rational alternative.Hodges's book is a bit long, but likely is to be considered the definitive psychological treatment of the subject, with sufficient math to keep folks such as me interested.",8,3

  In a man of his type, one never knows what his mental processes are going to do next.
- JAK Ferns, Turing's coronerThere have been two big films about Turing (three if you count the uselessly fictionalised Enigma (2001)). All of them are more or less dishonestly melodramatic; for instance they depict Turing's relationship with his dead love Christopher as the driver of his work on machine intelligence. And more generally they depict him as tragic. But he wasn't tragic: we were. In the 1950s we attacked a superlatively profound person, because we were certain it was the right thing to do.Hodges, whose book began the great public rehabilitation of Turing and served as the source for the films, bears no blame for this: it's one of the best biographies I've ever read (better even than Kanigel on Ramanujan and Issacson on Einstein).Begin with his achievements: 
  
   1935: Mathematical statistics: An independent proof of the Central Limit Theorem. 
  
   1935: Group theory: An extension to a theorem of von Neumann's. 
  
   1936: Mathematical logic: One of the all-time great papers, an answer to Hilbert's halting problem and an elaboration of the incompleteness of all mathematics, and the formal statement of a single machine that can perform all computable work. 
  
   1936: Computability theory: Same paper. Creator thereof. 
  
   1936: Automata theory: Same paper. Creator thereof. 
  
   1936: Computer engineering: Same paper. Inventor of the stored-program concept, used in all computers since 1950. 
  
   1937: Group theory: Proof that general continuous groups cannot be approximated by finite groups. 
  
   1938: Mathematical logic: Invention of ordinal logics, an attempt to handle incompleteness. 
  
   1938: Analytic number theory: Algorithm (""Turing's method"") for calculating values of the zeta-function. 
  
   1938: Computer engineering and Mathematical methodology: Design of an analogue machine to approximate the zeroes of the zeta function. 
  
   1939: Cryptanalysis: developed most of the logical methods used against Nazi Germany's naval cipher, Enigma. Including a new sort of indirect frequency analysis, ""simultaneous scanning"", search trees, an independent invention of Shannon's information entropy (as ""Weight of evidence"")... 
  
  
  
   1940: Mechanical engineering: redesigned the Polish Bomba to handle the exponential explosion in the Enigma's state space. 
  
   1941: Statistics: independent invention of sequential analysis, for ""Banburismus"". 
  
   1940: Bayesian inference: independent reinvention of Bayes factors and the first approximation of what we would now call empirical Bayes estimation. IJ Good quite rightly calls Bayes factors, ""Bayes-Turing factors"". (Though it should be Laplace-Turing factors.) 
  
   1942: Cryptanalysis: A hand-method for cracking the Lorenz cipher, ""Turingery"". 
  
   1944: Crytography, audio engineering and electrical engineering: Design, proof and much of the construction of ""Delilah"", an electronic speech encipherment device. 
  
   1945-6: Algorithmics: The discovery of the stack. A neglected but vast accomplishment. (Zuse had already implemented subroutines by then.) 
  
   1945-6: Computer engineering: Design of the Automatic Computing Engine, the first complete design of a stored-program computer, including circuit diagrams, instruction set and cost estimate. (von Neumann's is incomplete.) 
   1948: Computer music: The first computer music. Turing's handbook for the Mark I had a section on using it to produce notes, and they gave a demo for radio in 1951, also a first. Not really a synth (not real-time) and not real electronic music (produced by moving parts). 
  
   1948: Linear algebra: Better ways of solving linear systems and inverting matrices. 
  
   1949: Group theory: Proof that the 'word problem' is insoluable for cancellation semigroups. Computability mainstream in mathematics by then. 
  
   1949: Formal verification: Paper on proving that computer programs will behave. 
  
  
  
   1950: Philosophy of mind and artificial intelligence: His famous one, ""Computing machinery and intelligence"" is one of the top 100 set texts in philosophy, but Computable Numbers is deeper, outlining how computability places limits on what the brain can do, and how difficult it will be to redo. He sees machine learning coming very clearly. 
  
   1951: Group theory: Another big result in the word problem for groups. (unpublished) 
   1951: Chess engine: Published the first algorithm to play a full game of chess automatically. 
  
   1952: Mathematical biology: a profound chemical theory of how life grows, now a textbook model of morphogenesis. 
  
   1952: Number theory: Numerical evidence (computed on the Manchester Baby) for thousands of values of the zeta-function. 
  
   1952: Pattern formation: Construction of the ""Swift-Hohenberg"" equation, 23 years before them.  
  
  
 Copeland estimates that breaking U-boat Enigma saved 14 million lives, a large fraction of which we can lay at Turing's feet. This puts him in the top 50 life-savers ever. But what is most amazing (and endearing) is just how unsophisticated he was. 
   As at school, trivial examples of ‘eccentricity’ circulated in Bletchley circles. Near the beginning of June he would suffer from hay fever, which blinded him as he cycled to work, so he would use a gas mask to keep the pollen out, regardless of how he looked. The bicycle itself was unique, since it required the counting of revolutions until a certain bent spoke touched a certain link (rather like a cipher machine), when action would have to be taken to prevent the chain coming off. Alan had been delighted at having, as it were, deciphered the fault in the mechanism, which meant that he saved himself weeks of waiting for repairs, at a time when the bicycle had again become what it was when invented – the means of freedom. It also meant that no one else could ride it. He made a more explicit defence of his tea-mug (again irreplaceable, in wartime conditions) by attaching it with a combination lock to a Hut 8 radiator pipe. But it was picked, to tease him. Trousers held up by string, pyjama jacket under his sports coat – the stories, whether true or not, went the rounds. And now that he was in a position of authority, the nervousness of his manner was more open to comment. There was his voice, liable to stall in mid-sentence with a tense, high-pitched ‘Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah’ while he fished, his brain almost visibly labouring away, for the right expression, meanwhile preventing interruption. The word, when it came, might be an unexpected one, a homely analogy, slang expression, pun or wild scheme or rude suggestion accompanied with his machine-like laugh; bold but not with the coarseness of one who had seen it all and been disillusioned, but with the sharpness of one seeing it through strangely fresh eyes. ‘Schoolboyish’ was the only word they had for it. Once a personnel form came round the Huts, and some joker filled in for him, ‘Turing A.M. Age 21’, but others, including Joan, said it should be ‘Age 16’... It was demeaning, but the repetition of superficial anecdotes about his usually quite sensible solutions to life’s small challenges served the useful purpose of deflecting attention away from the more dangerous and difficult questions about what an Alan Turing might think about the world in which he lived. English ‘eccentricity’ served as a safety valve for those who doubted the general rules of society. More sensitive people at Bletchley were aware of layers of introspection and subtlety of manner that lay beneath the occasional funny stories. But perhaps he himself welcomed the chortling over his habits, which created a line of defence for himself, without a loss of integrity. 
We have words for this now (""nerd"", ""wonk"", ""aspie""), and massive institutions, and even social movements, but at the time he had to make do with ""don"", and hide inside academia. Again: the problem wasn't him, it was us. He gets called a mathematician most often, I suppose because people don't want to be anachronistic. But scroll up: his most famous work is as a logician and a systems architect, and much of the rest is statistics and algorithmics and cognitive science. He was falling between several chairs, until computer science caught up with him:
  a pure mathematician worked in a symbolic world and not with things. The machine seemed to be a contradiction... For Alan Turing personally, the machine was a symptom of something that could not be answered by mathematics alone. He was working within the central problems of classical number theory, and making a contribution to it, but this was not enough. The Turing machine, and the ordinal logics, formalising the workings of the mind; Wittgenstein’s enquiries; the electric multiplier and now this concatenation of gear wheels – they all spoke of making some connection between the abstract and the physical. It was not science, not ‘applied mathematics’, but a sort of applied logic, something that had no name. 
The philosopher-engineer. One of several moments in Hodge's book that left me dumbstruck is Turing arguing with Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. (In the spring of 1939 they were both teaching courses at Cambridge called that!) Bit awkward, and in my view Alan goes easy on Ludwig. But you still couldn't make it up.The government employed Turing for 9 years, paying him about £6000 over the duration (£150k in today's money). In that time he produced 3 gigantically advanced systems (most of the Hut 8 system, the Delilah and the ACE design), about 10 or 20 years ahead of their time. Hodges sees this as a triumph of managerial socialism. Now, breaking naval enigma for £6k is an unbelievable deal (the savings from undestroyed shipping and cargo would be in the billions). But the government suppressed Delilah and totally screwed up the ACE project. So I'm not sure if we can cheer too much. Keynes says somewhere that
  The important thing for Government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all.
This is true of Enigma, I suppose. But instructive failures are only helpful if they occur in public. (As at least the ACE report was.)The most annoying part of the films making up emotionally powerful unifying themes for Turing is that they are already there. (But to grasp them, you'd have to actually display what was most wonderful and important about him, his technical work, and there goes the box office.) Anyway, here's one that made me cry:
  In an end-of-term sing-song [at Sherborne, when Turing was 12], the following couplet described him: Turing’s fond of the football fieldFor geometric problems the touch-lines yield... another verse had him ‘watching the daisies grow’ during hockey... although intended as a joke against his dreamy passivity, there might have been a truth in the observation.[20 years later] ...One day he and Joan were lying on the Bletchley lawn looking at the daisies... Alan produced a fir cone from his pocket, on which the Fibonacci numbers could be traced rather clearly, but the same idea could also be taken to apply to the florets of the daisy flower.[30 years later] ...he was trying out on the computer the solution of the very difficult differential equations that arose when [one] followed the chemical theory of [plant] morphogenesis beyond the moment of budding... it also required some rather sophisticated applied mathematics, which involved the use of ‘operators’ rather as in quantum mechanics. Numerical analysis was also important... In this it was like a private atomic bomb, the computer in both cases following the development of interacting fluid waves....he also developed a purely descriptive theory of leaf-arrangement... using matrices to represent the winding of spirals of leaves or seeds round a stem or flower-head... The intention was that ultimately these two approaches would join up when he found a system of equations that would generate the Fibonacci patterns expressed by his matrices....Such observations reflected an insight gained from... [a program called] ‘Outline of Development of the Daisy’. He had quite literally been ‘watching the daisies grow’... on his universal machine.
