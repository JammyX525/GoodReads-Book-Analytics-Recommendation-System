13912,A Beautiful Mind,Chad Sayban,252,60,4,"January 21, 2015","More reviews at The Story Within The StoryAt first glance, a biography of a mathematician would seem to make for a read dryer than the Sahara. However, John Nash is no ordinary mathematician and Sylvia Nasar is no ordinary biographer. In her capable hands, the life of John Nash comes to life…in all of its brilliant, dark, pessimistic, extraordinary, callous wonder. John Forbes Nash, Jr. is a mathematical genius whose extraordinary mind developed the structure for what became known as Game Theory – revolutionizing both mathematics and economics in the second half of the twentieth century. The power of his theories culminated with him being awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics nearly fifty years after his groundbreaking work began. But it came at a heavy price. By the age of thirty, Nash was suffering from his first bouts of paranoid schizophrenia, a disease he would suffer with for three decades. He was institutionalized by his family on several occasions and left for dead by most of the mathematics community. Left to wander the campus of Princeton University as a “ghost” and a “crazy man,” Nash did the unthinkable – he began recovering from a disease that there was thought to be no recovery from. He even begin to work on mathematics research again. It was a recovery that physiatrists thought was impossible.
  “I've made the most important discovery of my life. It's only in the mysterious equation of love that any logic or reasons can be found.”
A Beautiful Mind is really not about mathematics, but about what it means to be labeled “gifted,” “different” or “sick.” It is about how society treats people who are unusual and how few answers there are for what goes on between someone’s ears. It is also about John’s wife Alicia, who set aside her own desires to try to guide John through a world that had become hostile to him.Ultimately, Sylvia Nasar succeeds with A Beautiful Mind because she leaves out most of the heavy-handed mathematics and focuses on who John Nash is and what his life represents. Make no mistake, John Nash not a lovable person. He is rude, thoughtless, self-centered and egotistical – all the things we don’t like in a person. His genius is both a gift and a curse. Yet, we cheer for him the whole way because there is an innocence about him; a childlike quality of someone who doesn’t quite understand other people but has to function within society none-the-less. And it is a society of the 1950s and 1960s with little understanding or tolerance for mental illness. His story also gives us hope that no matter how hopeless a person’s situation may seem, here is an example of someone who was able to climb out of that hole and rejoin life and be happy again. That is what makes John Nash’s story so important – A Beautiful Mind demonstrates that anyone’s life can be turned around. It demonstrates hope. It demonstrates redemption. It is a story well worth your time.",47,6
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Melania &#x1f352;,524,87,3,"October 28, 2020","3.25|5(Some Mild Spoilers Ahead)What I struggled most with in this book was young Nash’s personality. Half of the book I could only think about what a humongous piece of sh!t Nash was. I know he has his illness, but we don’t know for sure how/ if that influenced his personality as a youngster. The way he treated his friends or anyone around, for that matter, even the mother of his child, was unforgiving from where I stand. Not helping in any way raising his own son, pushing his future wife on the ground and putting his foot on her neck so his friends can see that she belonged to him, I mean.... I can’t get over this kind of actions for anything in the world. If I’ll ever remember Nash for one thing, this is it. And then, for the rest of the book, I could not help but to pity what he became. Alone, (and for good reasons) his most precious possession ,his mind, was turning against him. His abusive, childish character disappeared but he became a shell of himself. I don’t believe the movie is better either. I believe that Hollywood did with this story exactly was Hollywood does all the time: it erased big chunks of Nash’s personality in order to fit Hollywood’ standards of moral ‘cleanness’. Crow’s character is merely a shadow of real Nash, for better or for worse. With all this in mind, I don’t regret reading A Beautiful Mind but I don’t believe I’ll ever come back to the film or this book.",35,1 comment
13912,A Beautiful Mind,April,154,37,1,"August 14, 2016","The book conveys a convincing portrayal of mental illness; but, it is unpleasant to read. I found that I didn't enjoy spending so much time with a person who, in addition to being a genius, and mentally ill, was basically a creep. The movie was better - mainly because the screenplay converted Nash into a more likeable guy (helped to be played by Russell Crow). If you haven't read the book or seen the movie - I recommend the latter. But keep in mind it's not a terribly truthful portrayal.",34,10
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Eric_W,"1,914",347,5,"April 13, 2009","""'How could you,' Mackey asked, 'how could you, a mathematician, a man devoted to reason and logical proof. . . how could you believe that extra terrestrials are sending you messages? How could you believe that you are being recruited by aliens from outer space to save the world? How could you . . .?' ""Nash looked up at last and fixed Mackey with an unblinking stare as cool and dispassionate as that of any bird or snake. 'Because,' Nash said slowly in his soft, reasonable southern drawl, as if talking to himself, 'the ideas I had about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did. So I took them seriously.'""A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar is the biography of John Forbes Nash. Nash was brilliant. (The movie was terrific, but often bore little resemblance to reality.) At twenty-one he had invented a theory of modern human behavior and his contributions to game theory would ultimately win him a Nobel Prize. As a young professor he solved some mathematical problems deemed ""impossible"" by other mathematicians. He also became insane. This most fascinating book is the story of his descent into schizophrenia and his sudden remission at age sixty-two.Nash had that spark of genius reserved for the extraordinary few. He could visualize answers to problems that baffled others, often working out proofs later. He worked and learned not by absorbing what others had already accomplished but by rediscovering the concepts on his own. He was ""compulsively rational,"" and envied the emotionless, considering thinking machines superior to humans. He remained aloof from the mundane and was described by his contemporaries as ""queer,"" ""spooky,"" and ""isolated."" Ironically, he was to revolutionize the theories of social cooperation and conflict. Unlike Von Neumann who had focused on the group, Nash, in his twenty-seven-page dissertation thesis proposed a theory for game ""in which there was a possibility of mutual gain. His insight was that the game [economics:] would be solved when every player independently chose his best responses to the other player's best strategies. . . a decentralized decision-making process could, in fact, be coherent.""Princeton probably deserves the Nobel medal as much as anyone for sticking with the genius and putting up with his bizarre behavior as does his family who often sacrificed a great deal in their efforts to help him. Whether an ""ordinary"" person would have received such special care is perhaps another issue.What is truly ironic is that Nash's son suffers from the same condition as his father, but despite advances in pharmaceutical treatment for schizophrenia, his son has not displayed the signs of remission that brought his father back.",28,1 comment

    A Beautiful Mind
  
 is one of those books that I loved so much, and learned so much from reading that I've yet to actually review it. However, in light of the news that the man behind the eponymous mind, 
  John Forbes Nash Jr.,
 is no longer with us I thought I'd at least take the time to recommend the book, if not to explain why.

13912,A Beautiful Mind,Vincent Masson,41,24,5,"June 19, 2022","I definitely wasn't smart enough to understand the Math (although the author does a very good job putting it in layman's terms), but was absolutely riveted by the character of John Nash. Amazing Biography. ",24,2
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Paul,"2,306",20,4,"June 27, 2016","It seems to be a commonly held belief that genius often goes hand-in-hand with mental illness. I've often wondered if this is actually the case or whether it's just that most people have never heard of most genius level intellects that aren't afflicted in this way. How many of us could honestly say we'd ever have heard of John Nash if it weren't for his prolonged battle with schizophrenia (if 'battle' is even the right word)?I admit that I'd not heard of him until my wife recommended the movie to me after watching it with friends. I quickly bought it and loved it (I know which side my bread is buttered, folks) and this lead me to read the book the movie is based on.Having now finished the book, I have to say that it's made me reappraise the film. While I'm sure I'd still enjoy the movie, I now see that it is an extremely idealised version of Nash's life. It has left out large chunks of the less sympathetic aspects of the man's personality. It's almost impossible to say how much of Nash's (how to put this?) dickish behaviour was due to his as-yet-undiagnosed schizophrenia but it is clear (to this reader, anyway) that the man was a rather unlikeable individual long before he became ill.I don't, however, only want to read about people I'd like to have a drink with and, despite the rather unsavoury aspects of Nash's character, this is undeniably a fascinating book and I'm very glad I read it. It manages to be a 'warts-and-all' autobiography without ever stooping to sensationalism and remains respectful of its subject even while recounting some of his worst facets. I recommend it to anybody who has seen the movie version that would like to know the truth behind the Hollywood fairytale.It's also made me want to read more about game theory...",20,11
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Kirsten,"2,115",85,5,"February 16, 2008","This biography was the basis for the popular film ""A Beautiful Mind"" a few years ago. It's the fascinating story of an arrogant young mathematician who began his career with genius-level work in mathetmatics, succumbed to paranoid schizophrenia in his thirties, and ultimately experienced a remission in the late 80s and was awarded the Nobel Prize for his early work in game theory.Reading about Nash's early life and the beginning of his career, I couldn't help but notice that he was always rather an odd duck, even before he became delusional and was diagnosed as schizophrenic. I'm inclined to think that if he were a child now, it's fairly likely he would be diagnosed as having Asperger's or something similar, but that's just my uneducated opinion. His way of relating to the world was always sufficiently different that it took a long time for many of his colleagues to realize that his eccentricities had morphed into delusions. He was a genius, he was expected to behave oddly, and in some ways this both served as a measure of protection for him, and also may have prevented him from getting help earlier.I have to admit that I actually really disliked John Nash for a lot of the book. Even when he was sane, he was arrogant, self-absorbed, and unkind. He must have had some good qualities, though, other than his genius, because what really saved him in the end was the willingness of his friends and family to stand by him and try to help him. Again and again during his illness, his colleagues arranged work for him, smoothed over scandals caused by his odd behavior, and assisted his wife and mother in providing him with care. At times, his friends were almost too caring -- not having the same intimate contact with Nash that his wife Alice did, many of them believed he was not as ill as he actually was, and were very upset when he was involuntarily committed. The many points of view Nasar provides really bring home what it's like when someone succumbs to mental illness, and the way it affects just about everyone the person comes into contact with, like ripples in a pond.Nash's return to normality after years of delusional behavior is still something of a mystery to neuroscientists. This is not something that often happens in schizophrenic patients, which led some to posit that Nash may not have been schizophrenic, after all. Yet his behavior and experiences are much more consistent with schizophrenia than with any of the other illnesses, like biopolar disorder, that have been suggested. This leads to the conclusion that Nash is one of the lucky few who experience a near-complete remission after years of illness. I'd definitely recommend this biography to anyone with an interest in mathematics, mental illness, or who just likes a well-written biography.",18,N/A

13912,A Beautiful Mind,Jan Rice,508,426,5,"May 26, 2015","I was thinking of this book again because of the deaths of John and Alicia Nash. At this remove, I cannot remember any details. We had this book on audio during a car trip. In 2002 the medium may have been tape. We either had the book as well, or, if not, I was picking my husband's brain on the story's mathematical aspects. The story was well told, very moving; the aspects relating to his schizophrenia passed muster with me. Later we saw the film, and I was appalled; thought the schizophrenia had been reworked to fit public expectations (to conform to some meme). In the news article I read, all references were to the film; it was as though there had never been a book. Again, it was very good; although the details have faded, it possibly was in a class with Simon Winchester's The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary",16,2
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Kali Srikanth,65,67,4,"May 27, 2015","Update: 24/05/15Noble Laureate, Genius Mathematician John Nash is no longer with us. He is killed in a car accident along with his wife.http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/j...****This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. It is a story about the mystery of the human mind, in three acts:1. GENIUS: Perhaps John Nash was the greatest mathematical genius ever born in his times. He grew up as a child who lacked social skills (which his parents feared the most), days he locked himself up in dark room with books alone, has no close friends etc., all he got was his mother, his sister and his mathematical books. Soon after he grew up into a young man who took up Secret-code breaking jobs at RAND, who gave mind blowing seminars at Princeton & MIT and who invented theories (at Carnegie) which no one could possibly think of. But what author irritates you with in this genius tale is jumping into long and unnecessary back stories of people who inspired John or made friends with or simply he met and long mathematical equations/jargon which I never understood (which proved life achievement otherwise to John of course). As a person John was never liked by anyone but everyone approved that he is a genius.  2. MADNESS: Perhaps this is the worst phase that any human being could get into leave alone John. He often flew off from country alone (only wife was allowed to see him), approached NATO countless times as a refugee. He met horrible treatment days at hospitals (to cope with his delusions). What made his life worse were conflicts between his mistress (who is bearing his son now) and his wife, Alicia Nash who is stubborn enough not to give up on John and stay with him despite of his dangerous conduct towards others and to himself (To me she was more inspiring through-out than her husband). In eye’s blink John lost 25 years which he always regretted. Finally, his wife gave up on him too. Now John is all alone and he has his madness in its peaks.3. REAWAKENING: I count this book as inspiring not because it’s about a mathematician who solved problems in a snap which took lifetime to his colleagues just to understand them, but because of his determination to deal with his delusions, his will to cope with his illness, his awareness to revitalize his relations with people (who considered him as mad by the time) around him and his remarriage with Alicia Nash again and his reawakening state as a whole (Perhaps this is the best part of the whole book). No wonder people fought for John to nominate him at the Noble in spite of his illness and awkward behavior (his nomination alone can jeopardize the status of the Noble prize and its history you see, this triggered few people at Noble committee to oppose his nomination) This is the story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. It is a story about the mystery of the human mind. Inspiring, but not perfect in writing (more academic, unnecessarily long and too explanatory at times). 4/5 to this Pulitzer prize nominated, Oscar winning film turned inspiring biography.",15,N/A
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Wafaa,182,182,1,"April 2, 2017","I hardly finished part one of this book, it's too slow, filled with information and details even about John Nash's friends, the writer wanted to give us a full picture about John Nash's life and the people around him , but it seemed as if she wanted to have more pages filled.I liked the Idea of reading about a Mathematician but it was enough with the writer...John Nash is an interesting extraordinary man, I liked him through the documentary and the movie but not the novel. here are people stories living with schizophrenia  https://youtu.be/-8RhNMRyKG0 https://youtu.be/48YJMOcykvcI liked the movie (3.5 stars) and I watched a documentary about his life which was much better than the book itself. here is the link to the documentary about John Nash's life https://youtu.be/96Yb-w7427U",13,N/A
13912,A Beautiful Mind,Inkspill,380,37,4,"May 16, 2022","This audiobook ran just over 18 hours, starting with the lives of John Nash’s parents and ending with roughly after he’s awarded the Nobel prize.To be honest, if I had not seen the movie, which I’ve watched many times, then this would have passed me by as I was going through random searches on Libby, looking for interesting reads. And I wasn’t sure what to expect but this meets more than my expectations, and, compared to the movie. This story is made beautiful as it is tragic as it is hopeful. It’s a heroic tale in how his paranoid schizophrenia didn’t stop his work colleagues, at Princeton or RAND, seeing his lucid, quick thinking, creative mind.And reading a biography of a maths genius sounds boring but Sylvia Nasar there were also moments of charm and humour, some of my fav are when Sylvia Nasar describes situations where John Nash comes up with ease for solutions of complex maths problems (that dumbfounded his colleagues).What I loved most about this book is its sensitive handling of a genius who, from childhood, has hung on the periphery of common daily life because of the way he works mentally.I also liked how Sylvia Nasar also showed John Nash with all his flaws, so at times he was not likeable, and really, really not likeable, especially his treatment of his lovers, family, wife and children but this was balanced with how he won the loyalty of other mathematicians, where a few described him as being gentle and just saw through to his goodness.The biography also gave a wonderful portrait of his wife, Alicia Nash, who despite their very difficult relationship, is the one who supports him and gets him the help needed. I consider her to be phenomenally brave and amazing as their son, also called John Nash, would also down the line be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, so she had two people to look after, but later John Nash would also help her take care of their son.Also, by listening to this I come away with a better understanding of game theory (which was really down to how Sylvia Nasar explained it); social politics in the US between the 40s-60s; the purpose and working of the RAND corporation; and the politics involved in awarding the Nobel prize – which I would have never guessed.At its heart, Sylvia Nasar tells not only a story of a maths genius but also the challenges a family faces when managing and living with mental health.
