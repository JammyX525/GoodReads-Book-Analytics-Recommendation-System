106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Mike (the Paladin),"3,145",1783,5,"March 20, 2012","I went 4 stars on this book, and then went back and gave it 5. As far as ""literary rating"" or readability I'd say that I liked Mr. Metaxes' book on Bonhoeffer a little better. Again that's in readability. This book tends to have a lot of detail about the world and time of William Wilberforce that doesn't relate directly to the ""main"" topic (""The Heroic Campaign to End Slavery) but does relate to him, his life, and touches on the main topic peripherally. While it tends (at times) to slow the narrative a bit, it is valuable and widens the picture of Wilberforce and the world in which he lived. This is an exceptional book about an exceptional person. The observation is made in the text of the book that it's amazing how little is known about William Wilberforce today. His name should be as well known as any of the giants of history that school children can (or should be able to) name. It seems in many ways that he succeeded so well that the very ideas and REALITY he struggled against is one that ""we"" in the modern world have trouble realizing.Slavery, while still around in the shadows of our world today, practiced by evil people out of the light was until the middle of the 19th century not only nothing remarkable, but the accepted norm of the world. Regarded as necessary and normal, having been around THROUGHOUT RECORDED HISTORY slavery was ""no big deal"". However, the abolitionist movement was widely considered to be radical, dangerous, anti-government and anti-economy. It was also thought to be the purview of ""religious fanatics"". Wilberforce's struggle in England and final success gave strength and encouragement to the struggle here. I can not give you a generalized view of all that this book covers, the information it contains and the story it tells. Well that and a recommendation. I'D SAY, DON'T MISS IT.I'm a Christian (if you're not, please don't tune out, no sermon coming or anything) as such I'm aware that Jesus never intended the Christian Church to be a ""civil governing body"". We are not to establish a Christian Theocracy...we are to live as Christians letting that permeate our entire lives and be good citizens. Throughout history there have been times when Christians have had to confront evils so heinous that they could not turn away. Slavery was/is one of those. The story told in this is one of struggle against overwhelming odds and also one of great faith.I don't think I can recommend this book too highly. Yes, 5 stars. ",27,15
106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Cynda ,"1,238",141,5,"October 31, 2018","Excellent delightful narrator: Johnny Heller. Did the voices to extent that I recognized he was doing voices but not to extent of sounding cheesy.Eric MetMetaxas writes a psychological biology. He gives the reader an in-depth understanding of parents, family, foster parents, schoolmates, his particular life-long friend William Pitt, the YoungerThe book is heavily directed towards US Americans. In the parts where Metaxas describes young Wilberforce's worldview and where Metaxas describes the on-going arguments of Parliament, slaveship owners, and other participants in Parliaments' decisions to eliminate the slave trade and later to emancipate slave. Metaxas explains 18th- and 19th-century English thought in 21st-century US ways. He repeatedly mentions US/America.Wilberforce acts as a Force for Loving Kindness, yes. But more than that, he has a solid grasp of theology of English--Anglicans and Methodists and a solid grasp on the Dignity of Mankind. (""Man/Mankind"" would be Wilberforce's term, not mine.)As Wilberforce approaches adulthood, the Age of Democracy quickly arrives. He is born at the perfect time, has the perfect experiences, has the perfect connections, has the perfect political status to become a Great Agent for Good.Wilberforce started with/amassed a fortune that allowed him to be a prime organizer of Societies, Intisitutions, Associations, and other Organizations that furthered development of democracy.When receiving general educations, we are often led to appreciate of the Victorian Age with Victoria being assisted by her committed and somewhat empowered husband Prince Albert. Yet that understanding is plainly wrong.One afternoon, the Duchess of Kent asked for Wilberforce to call. He is 55 or 60 years old, playing on the floor with Young Victoria. Quote from book:Here on the miniature plain of the carpet in a prophetic tableau of domestic happiness is the child who would lend the future era her name met the man who give it its character.End of QuoteWhy do we not remember him? Why did the US not take example of some citizens of GB who wanted to strive to restore some of the dignity of Africa by supporting the return amd the empowerment of their human assets in Sierra Leone. Something similar and more successfully would be done in Haiti. Movie Comment. I first learned of Wilberforce by watching movie Amazing Grace. The movie cannot do justice to world-history-changing events nor even to the people involved in the struggle. And nothing about civil rights activities taken by inner group of Wilberforce along with many others in India, Sierra Leone, Haiti or about how Napoleon upon leaving Elba capitulated and emancipated the slaves almost immediately as ploy to deflect English anger.I strongly suggest reading this book.",11,4

After reading I felt like I knew the man as well as the cause. Some passages are laborious, especially as the reading nears the end and anticipates the climatic ending. Very enjoyable to revisit a most important historical movement. ",11,N/A
106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Pat,7,1 follower,5,"December 26, 2022",If I could I would give this more than 5 stars and highly recommended. I had no idea this period was so brutal and hopeless for the majority of people except the rich. This actually gives me great hope for our times to see how God used this humble man to change so many hearts for the slaves and poor downtrodden in humanity. It now makes me understand much more what Charles Dickens saw and wrote about. Even more heartwarming was how William Wilberforce gave all the glory to God for their movements victories. It was a good whole movement with many players and Wilberforce was the pied piper so to speak ❤️,7,4
106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Jamie Collins,"1,418",261,3,"March 3, 2014","This is an enthusiastic hagiography, an easy-breezy read with a strong Christian perspective. It’s a little preachy, actually, with corny jokes thrown in to keep the congregation engaged. I enjoyed the book pretty well, but I didn’t know Metaxas was primarily a writer of religious works or I’d have chosen a more scholarly, objective biography. This has a bibliography but no index or cited sources.It has a nice set of illustrations: portraits of Wilberforce and his notable associates, a copy of the famous layout of the interior of the slave ship Brookes which “captivated all of England”, and a photo of Josiah Wedgwood’s antislavery cameo (“Am I not a man and a brother?”) which “popularized the message of abolition throughout Britain and presaged the logos, campaign buttons, and bumper stickers of our own day”.The author repeatedly stresses that “the churches of mid-eighteenth-century England had all but abandoned orthodox, historical Christianity and now preached a tepid kind of moralism…. England had decidedly turned its back on any expressions of what we might call serious Christian belief”. Wilberforce famously converted to evangelical Christianity, which he credited as the motive for his lifelong battle for the abolition of slavery as well as his work to ameliorate social ills in Britain. The author gives Wilberforce credit for helping to popularize the concept of noblesse oblige in Britain, and the idea that politicians should work for the good of society rather than for their own advancement.The narrative continues for a few chapters after the passage of the 1807 Slave Trade Act, Wilberforce’s great victory, although it loses a little steam. He successfully advocates for introducing Christianity into India (which one critic described as “a change from looting to paternalism”) and continued working for the abolition of slavery and other noble causes. For some reason there are several pages describing the inglorious squabbles of George IV and his estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick, because Wilberforce met with Caroline once in an attempt to mediate between them.I like the movie about Wilberforce, also called Amazing Grace and equally hagiographic, which has a particularly fine cast.",7,N/A
106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,James,212,4,5,"January 10, 2016","D.L. Moody said, ""The world has yet to see what God can do with a man fully consecrated to him. By God’s help, I aim to be that man.” I think he was wrong. William Wilberforce was such a man, and Eric Metaxas captured his story beautifully. If you've never heard of Wilberforce, who waged a decades-long campaign to abolish the slave trade (and eventually Slavery itself) in the British Empire in the 18th and early 19th centuries, this book is a highly accessible and rewarding introduction.

106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Stephen,508,152,4,"May 28, 2016","Enjoyed this one - fascinating subject and an easy read. Amazing to read what Wilberforce achieved against all odds and interesting historically with it's references to the American Wars of Independence, French revolution, Napoleon and Kings George III and IV. Wilberforce not only abolished slavery but also changed the way of thinking of his generation and helped to transform the church. ",6,N/A

106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Jeff Short,526,11,5,"January 24, 2014","Excellent book. Things slowed up a bit toward the end, as life usually does, but I mostly did not want to put it down. Aside from being a well-written, well-researched book, this is an important book. Wilberforce's life deserves to be more widely known. I came into the book knowing that he was key in the fight for the abolition of the slave trade in England in the early nineteenth century, but that was about all. I am thankful to know better now.His life has many lessons for us--faith, perseverance, service, charity, etc. Wilberforce had begun a promising political career when he was converted to Christianity. He then faced a crossroads crisis. He did finally decide to remain in politics, but to do so with a Christian worldview, not divorcing his faith from the public square. His faith informed and drove his public service. He was resolved to pursue two great objects with his life--abolition of the slave trade and the reformation of manners (by which he meant the morality of the nation). His was a life lived to a great purpose.Wilberforce was pre-Victorian, and you might also say he helped make Victorian England possible. We tend to romanticize these periods of British history. Metaxas gives us a good look at the reality that was not so idyllic. The time was full of excesses, cruelties, injustices, and wickedness. Wilberforce engaged his generation and challenged them. We have many parallels today. Human trafficking is by no means gone, but we presuppose it wrong. Cruelties and injustice still abound. How shall we then live?Metaxas has quite a bit of personality, but he mostly stayed out of the way that we might see Wilberforce the more clearly. I appreciated that effort. I highly recommend this book.",4,N/A
106610,Amazing Grace William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery,Jonathan,44,8,2,"June 7, 2012","[Disclaimer: This review covers only chapter 1]I was excited to start this book; Metaxas is an engaging writer and Wilberforce has long been a favorite of mine. That said, I'm putting it down after the introductory chapter. I believe Wilberforce was a good, and even potentially great, man. I believe he made important contributions to society--both in Britain and worldwide. Yet Metaxas' praise is embarrassingly over the top: Wilberforce as the pivot of history? (Personally, I thought that moment came a little less than 18 centuries previously...) Wilberforce as the greatest social reformer in world history? (Maybe if you really tailor your definition of social reformer to give it an early nineteenth-century denotation.) Wilberforce is responsible for the fact that people now have a social conscience--which they didn't have before he pushed them into getting one? That argument is strained well past the point of incredulity and ignores (or distorts outright) significant parts of the historical record. Because I revere the memory of Wilberforce, I'm stopping now and moving on down my crowded reading list. I'm not going to pollute that memory with hagiography. I suppose it would be uncharitable to start the ""William Wilberforce Memorial Fund to Pay Eric Metaxas' Way Through a Historiography Course,"" though that's my current inclination...[1 star for the introduction; another star because the rest of the book--which I'm leaving aside for now--has to get better than that.]",4,N/A

I also didn´t like the blow against LGBTQ+ people in the beginning, and constant use of ""negro"", even if it was in citations, as it could have been explained beforehand.I would like to read something less hagiographic about him or the abolitionists on the whole, with more history and earnest sources and less drama.

To learn of William Wilberforce's devotion to ending slavery as well as the other horrific practices of his day, and how he gave his energy and life to these causes, was very touching. I am completely in awe of the depth of study that the author undertook and he wove it like an organic story which I truly enjoyed, though there were so many people he mentioned that I found myself getting a tad confused at times.

He gave his whole life to put an end to slavery in Britain and helped change the whole outlook on those “less than us” that was so prevalent at that time. He championed the rights of all people and animals and did so with so much kindness and goodness in his heart. ,4,1 comment
