With her husband, F. Scott Fitzgerald, she moved in a golden aura of excitement, romance, and promise.

Zelda traces the inner disintegration of a gifted, despairing woman, torn by the clash between her husband's career and her own talent.","Nancy Lee Winston Milford (March 26, 1938â€“March 29, 2022) was an American biographer.
