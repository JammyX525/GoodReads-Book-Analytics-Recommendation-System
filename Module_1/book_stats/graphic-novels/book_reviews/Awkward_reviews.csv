I loved the plot, the drawings, and the 2 main characters: the lovely Penelope (Peppi) and the cute Jaime. She is into the arts and he is into science in middle school.""Cardinal rule #1 for surviving school: Don't get noticed by mean kids. Cardinal rule #2: Seek out groups with similar interests and join them. Cardinal rule #3: Build. Build things. Build friendships. Build yourself. Bit by little bit. It may feel like you're not adding that much... but in the end, it will add up to a lot.""",45,4
23657454,Awkward,Lata,"3,431",179,4,"February 6, 2017","Fun, simple little story that was recommended to me by my child, who loved this book (read it repeatedly before telling me to read it.)Penelope is the new kid at school who starts the year off by pushing a boy who's looked down on by others. She regrets her action, and spends several weeks attempting to deal with it. There is also ongoing drama between the after school art club (Penelope's a member) and the science club (the boy is a member). And something else I really liked about this story: the kids, their families and the teachers reflected people of different races, cultures and body types. The artwork has a manga-like look, and there is minimal use of colour; I liked how the panels really conveyed the kids' energy.(Note: This book, and several others, was selected by the province's Library Association as part of a yearly program to expose kids to Canadian authors and, of course, to promote literacy.)",32,8
23657454,Awkward,Kelli,844,389,5,"October 9, 2016","This charming graphic is shelved as YA but would be entirely appropriate for upper elementary. A sweet story about a diverse group of students who must learn to work together to arrive at a shared goal, this one has a positive message without being unrealistic or overly sappy. After the story, the author provides insight into character development and detailed information on the steps and hard work involved in creating a graphic novel (6-7 hours per page), as well as contagious enthusiasm for her craft. I was entertained and touched by this book. I would hand it to my nine-year-old without hesitation. 4.5 stars",31,N/A
23657454,Awkward,Calista,"3,791",31200,4,"February 18, 2021","Oh, this was such a great middle grade story about an art club at odds with the science club. We see the lines drawn like the Capulets and Montagues. We follow the quiet science geek and art lover. We realize that both kids have so much in common. One of the beautiful things in the story is how much art and science actually have in common. They bring up Leonardo da Vinci being a Renaissance man and being skilled at both and many talents. The clubs basically go to war with each other and it’s the unlikely friendship of our 2 main leads that the story hinges on. The science kids are treated more like rock stars than nerds and the cool art kids are treated more like nerds than cool. It’s an interesting flip, at least at our school that was how it worked. I thought it was good. This is filled with humor and heart and how awkward it is to learn these life lessons. I think my niece would enjoy this and I am going to recommend it to her. ",25,N/A
23657454,Awkward,Adri,920,806,5,"November 27, 2015","Hands down one of the best comics I've read all year!Hilarious, thoughtful, and full of heart, Awkward showcases a wonderful array of genuine characters. This comic casually includes characters of color (many who are successful and/or in positions of power), a disabled mother (who is also fantastic and successful), multiethnic families, dysfunctional families, a wonderful discussion on the merits of art and science and whether they're truly opposites, and a boy-girl friendship that isn't romantic!! Need I say more?This comic made me laugh, smile, clutch my chest, and it made me feel good. We need more books like this that just make people feel good because they render the world in a real and genuine way.I hope Svetlana Chmakova makes more middle grade comics, because the world needs her art and her perspective. I will be recommending this book to every human I know!",24,1 comment
23657454,Awkward,Mississippi Library Commission,389,71,5,"May 13, 2016","We're going to be recommending this darling graphic novel to everyone we meet. Aimed at 8-12 year old kids, Awkward will appeal to teens and adults as well. There are so many things we loved about it: it's smart, it's funny, it's diverse in multiple ways, it's got art and science and geocaching, and it's downright adorable. Most of all, the characters reach out and grab their readers' hearts. We wanted to hug each and every one of them by the time we reached the very satisfying ending. Highly recommended.",16,N/A
23657454,Awkward,Jacob Proffitt,"2,849",1490,5,"July 1, 2017","I just devoured this story. It's a comic, so a fast read, but I was just so charmed by it that I didn't want to put it down for even a moment. Chmakova so perfectly captures that age and the concerns and social dynamics. I really loved both the affection and clarity that engages memory, sympathy, and even a little healing by taking those awkward dynamics and illustrating a way through them that was both plausible and hopeful. It doesn't hurt, of course, that Peppi and Jaime are such wonderfully realistic people and so carefully drawn (both literally and, uh, figuratively...).Plus, I have the added bonus of looking forward to gushing about it with my enthusiastic daughter tomorrow. I love when she gets engaged with something because she throws her whole heart over and this is a love I can share in that same way. Worth all the stars even before that part, but that's always a boost.",12,N/A
23657454,Awkward,Erica,"1,292",424,4,"August 24, 2017","So adorable!I'm glad I read the second book, Brave, first because it put this one into a more favorable context; I think I'd have been peevish in my reading had I not known what comes next. Awkward is a little awkward, it doesn't quite have its flow, yet. Everything that comes off so gracefully in the next book - diverse characters, middle-school problems, family problems - feel a little more forced, less organic, in this first volume.Regardless, it's a great start, following the very likeable and relatable Penelope as she enters a new school and makes a mistake the very first day, a gaffe that haunts her for weeks to come. Shyness, bullying, social acceptance, competition, working together, friendship, forgiveness, parental pressure to succeed, family fighting, and daily middle school survival are all themes in this story.Characters have defined personalities beyond the way they're drawn, which are built up further in Brave. Adults are supportive, for the most part - no Dahlian parents or teachers here! You know, had my middle school been peopled with these characters, I'd have had crushes on 90% of the population, both teachers and students! The one weird thing I've noticed, though, is a lack of siblings. I have never encountered so many single-child families represented in a middle grade book. So far, Letitia and Felicity are the sole representation of sisters in the school; the three households we get to visit are only child households. That was strange to me but maybe it's an accurate reflection of contemporary families, I have no idea.Highly recommended for fans of Raina Telgemeier and of Roller Girl. And, seriously, make sure this is in both your school and public library because this needs to be available to kids everywhere.",11,6
23657454,Awkward,Erin,"2,815",494,4,"October 14, 2016","This is definitely one of the best middle grade graphic novels that I've read. I loved the characters, the middle school setting, the conflict that arises between the two student clubs-science and art, and the glimpse at what it means to be a friend. As a teacher, the characters in the story display problem-solving skills and work on resolving their existing conflict. I know my grade 7 and 8 girls have really enjoyed this story as well. It probably would grab the attention of young girls in grades 4-6 as well. ",10,6
23657454,Awkward,Caroline,31,2,4,"February 22, 2017",I really liked this book. The characters were so diverse in diffrent ways. It was also very reflective of how middle schoolers act when boys and girls are friends. I loved all the people's relationships with their parents. ,9,N/A
23657454,Awkward,Amy Layton,"1,641",48,4,"May 14, 2020","This was so cute!!  With manga-like illustrations, themes of owning up to one's actions, and an adorkable plot, it's impossible to not enjoy Awkward.  When Peppi accidentally snubs the school's resident nerd, she feels terrible and spends weeks trying to figure out how to apologize.  So imagine her surprise when he's the one chosen to tutor her in science!  As the two navigate their middle school hallways, friendships, rivalries, and school spirit, they grow closer together.It's clear that Chmakova spent a lot of time on all of her characters.  Even secondary and background characters not only have a structural purpose, but have their own wants, needs, backgrounds, and desires to fit in.  And it was wonderful.  It was middle school in a nutshell.  And, just like the title suggests, middle school is awkward as heck, and Chmakova somehow embodied that entire feeling in one graphic novel.I can't wait to read the next in the series and seeing how these characters progress and grow as they learn to be kind, embrace challenges, and identify healthy rivalry.Review cross-listed here!",8,1 comment

I found this on a table at a book sale this weekend. Looking forward to cataloging it, and getting it out on the shelves for the library patrons to enjoy.",8,N/A
23657454,Awkward,The Half-blood Reader,911,52,5,"March 6, 2020","I have loved some of Svetlana's previous works, and she did not disappoint with this MG story.From the art style and the character's designs to the choice of colours, I loved it all. It was so soft.I also found the characters engaging and believable, humour aside. Stubbornness and unreasonable antagonism towards the ""other"" is something that happens frequently when it comes to humans.Awkward is a great lesson for school kids. Or perhaps a bunch of tiny lessons with a big one.",7,N/A

After reading straight for 30 mins, I can't believe I finished it in a single sitting. Oh well, I will slog through 1 hour more in work office *ugh...These characters are so adorable and cute. It's a science vs art club drama but so much more. I really loved this! Reminded me of Big Nate comics I love so much as well.",7,N/A
