6375845,Batman Hush,Jayson,"1,515",3231,4,"March 30, 2020","(A-) 81% | Very GoodNotes: A grandiose, sprawling, byzantine epic, it's about exploiting vulnerabilities and the tactical manipulation of memory.",389,14
6375845,Batman Hush,Anne,"3,785",6900,5,"September 26, 2021","A (now) classic Batman story that I think holds up very well.This is one that I've read multiple times in multiple editions, and I really think that the 15th Anniversary edition is very well done. I loved seeing all the Easter eggs that I'd missed over the years pointed out to me. <--did you know Jean Grey and Gwen Stacy were buried in the Gotham Cemetary? I always miss stuff like that if someone doesn't shove my face in it, so it was a nice bonus to have the artist spoon feeding it to me in the back of the comic.If you haven't read this story, then the gist is that someone knows Bruce Wayne is Batman and is out to destroy him. This villain is targeting not only Bruce but the people Bruce loves. Speaking of people Bruce loves, he and Selina...?Bow chicka wow wowOk. So, the whole time you're trying to figure out who is the mastermind behind all of these attacks, and every time your think you've gotten to the Big Reveal, the rug gets snatched out from under you.Tons of red herrings all over the place!So whodunnit?Hush. It's a secret.Also, if you've only watched the animated version, you're in for a surprise. The comic and the movie have some pretty big differences. <-I can't really say much more without spoiling the whole thing.Highly Recommended!",138,57
6375845,Batman Hush,Baba,"3,503",725,4,"December 9, 2022","Collecting Batman #608-619, the superb Jeph Loeb / Jim Lee team-up that sees Batman being mightily confused and attacked from all sides, both by villains and heroes, as a person from his past seeks to wreak havoc on his life. Co-stars Catwoman, Oracle and Robin, as well as appearances by Superman, Nightwing, Huntress and more. A truly memorable Batman story. 8 out of 12 - Four Star read :)2012 read",131,N/A

6375845,Batman Hush,Shelby *trains flying monkeys*,"1,560",5819,4,"January 30, 2015","I had such a hard time deciding how to rate this one. I liked it and I didn't like it. I'm going with a four star..just because I love me some Batman and there are several really good things about this book.Like: Batman and Catwoman. Do I like them together doing the smoochie smoochie? Well, somewhat. 
  
I thought it would be hotter than it was..I mean come on, they are both awesomeness..but well it kinda fizzled in this book.But here? Pure hawt.
  
Yes, I know I'm weird. I've been told that before.The artwork: Frigging amazing. 
  
Ohhhh Bats-you are looking good.
  
They story was fairly decent at times. I liked him teaming up with Superman and I figured out who the bad guy was before the end, but it's not a bad book.What I thought was over the top:Too much going on. Why does the Batman series that I've read have to have every bad guy that he has ever fought in each book? I felt sorry for the poor guy because he was running around like a chicken with his head cut off.
  
In the end this is one of the better Batman books I've read. He is on the darker side and I love him when he gets all angry and angsty.
  
ETA: I forgot this! My friend Hulk boy aka Jeff recommended this to me. He seems to know the comic books I might like..if he would quit ignoring Kelly and I lately because we Goldblum/Groinkick/Vomit gif him to death. ",99,12
6375845,Batman Hush,Swrp,561,84,3,"April 29, 2021","A multi-starrer action graphic novel! Blurb:The story depicts a mysterious stalker called Hush who seems intent on sabotaging Batman from afar, and it includes many guest appearances by Batman villains, as well as various members of the Batman Family and Batman's close ally Superman. It also explores the romantic potential between Batman and Catwoman.",90,2
6375845,Batman Hush,Jeff ,912,674,4,"August 4, 2016","Batman and Catwoman sitting in a tree, K-I–S-S- .. . Okay, enough with that.What I find fascinating is that nearly every Batman graphic novel I’ve read recently has been a good/great one. Forbidden Planet lists their top 50 graphic novels of all time. Batman has 5. No one else comes close. Many of the major comic writers have all tackled Batman: Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Alan Moore, Jeph Loeb, Ed Brubaker, Neil Gaiman, Chuck Dixon etc. etc. https://forbiddenplanet.com/picks/50-... What makes Batman such a compelling character and fodder for some of the greatest stories ever written? In short: 1.	 His tragic background – After he witnessed his parents being murdered during a botched robbery attempt, Bruce Wayne vowed to rid Gotham City of crime. It’s this unrelenting pathos that drives the character. 2.	He’s only human – Unlike his buddy, Superman, Batman has no superpowers. He uses his wits, athletic prowess and all the Bat toys a bilionare-playboy can buy. He won’t break the law (much) and he absolutely won’t kill. Unlike Superman, he’s prone to darkness, hence the whole Bat theme. In this volume, he beats the crap out of the Joker (let’s face it, the Joker had it coming. For a long time) and almost kills him.3.	His supporting players – A bunch of Robins, Nightwing, Batgirl, Batwoman, Oracle, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Catwoman and Ace, the Bat Hound. All iconic in their own right.4.	His rogue’s gallery – Batman probably has the greatest group of villains in the history of comic books. Only Spider-Man comes close. And because he won’t kill, they’re endlessly recycled.5.	He’s a scientisthttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqBSnQ...6.	The Batusi – not really.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8BZDw...The review (finally). Batman is being stalked by an unknown antagonist. This villain is using/controlling many of Batman’s foes in unique ways. Batman moons over getting kissed by Catwoman. He’s kind of lonely so he invites her into the inner Bat-circle-of-friends. Jeph Loeb’s story combines nicely with Jim Lee’s muscular art. An excellent Batman story!",51,5
6375845,Batman Hush,Anne,"3,785",6900,3,"September 13, 2020","I've read Hush in the past (Batman: Hush, Vol. 1, Batman: Hush, Vol. 2), but this one is some kind of collector's edition or something.Except I didn't actually open the book at the library.So.Yeah, it turns out that Hush Unwrapped is meant to showcase Jim Lee's penciling. Which, to be fair, are really impressive. However, I'm not a fan of black and white comics. Not only that, but it's is really hard in some of the panels to tell exactly what is going on. Especially the action scenes. I enjoyed the story, but I wouldn't recommend this version to someone who hasn't read it before. This is something geared more toward fans of Lee's art or fanatic collectors.",45,10
6375845,Batman Hush,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,1,"August 11, 2020","Hush is without doubt one of the worst Batman books of the last 15 years but what makes it even worse is how highly it's rated by so many comics readers. Well, I re-read this recently because I couldn't remember a thing about it from the first and only other time I read this years ago and what did I find? Good reason for why I couldn't remember a thing about it. So I wrote an article on its many failings here",44,12
6375845,Batman Hush,Dan Schwent,"2,861",10500,4,"August 24, 2012","An unknown enemy is trying to destroy Batman at the same time he enters into a relationship with Catwoman. But who knows all of Batman's secrets?I've been hearing about Hush since it was coming out in monthly format and finally decided to give it a chance. It was totally worth it.Honestly, I was skeptical at first. While I liked Jeph Loeb's work on Batman: The Long Halloween, I thought it felt a little padded. As for Jim Lee, I was wondering if he still had that old magic. I was not disappointed.Hush pits Batman against many of his foes, including a new one, Hush. Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, Joker, Harley Quinn, Croc, and others all make appearances. Batman's relationship with Catwoman is explored, as are his relationships with other members of his supporting cast. Jim Lee's art has come along since his days as the flavor of the month artist that made his mark on X-Men before helping form Image.I do have a few gripes, however. It was pretty obvious who would turn out to be Hush. Tommy Elliot was never mentioned before but suddenly Bruce remembers him as his best friend during his childhood. Not much detective work required from the reader. I was pleased that it turned out to be more complicated than that, what with Riddler and the Lazarus Pit and all. It did lead to Jason Todd being resurrected, something I'm still not that thrilled about.Hush is the best Batman book not written by Scott Snyder that I've read in a long time. It's not earth shattering but is highly recommended.",42,N/A
6375845,Batman Hush,matt,574,9,2,"August 6, 2008","I guess I'm mostly alone in not thinking much about this title -- but here are my reasons:SPOILERS BELOW********************************************************************************I don't think Lee's artwork is right for this story. I know this is a very ""personal taste"" kind of thing - but so be it. His work is very ""high-def"", and I think mysteries are more effective with subtle, even murky images...I don't want to see each individual sinew of Batman's bicep, and I don't think it helps set the tone of the story.While the mystery was fun to try and solve, and the twists and manipulations were surprising, the final reveal of the criminal was a huge letdown. The childhood friend? Really? He was so bitter that his mom survived Wayne's surgery, that he waited years - became a renowned surgeon - and plotted to destroy Wayne's son - all the while ""pretending"" to be a good kid???? Okay, even if I could accept that he was acting like a good kid, while really being full of hate -why would his hate be directed at Bruce? Why wouldn't he just make another attempt on his mother's life? And why would he go to the trouble of becoming a surgeon when all he wanted to do with his life was inherit a fortune? I dunno - just seems really weak to me. ",41,11

6375845,Batman Hush,Shannon,"3,029",2343,5,"July 1, 2017","Absolutely fantastic.Though, holy spoilers, Batman.Hehehe.I suppose you have to expect that with such a long running series, but honestly this doesn't keep me from wanting to read the previous stories any bit even though I know what's going to happen now. Plus, I kind of knew bits and pieces from the movies, the animated series, and the video games already so I can't really complain that much.I really love all of the women in this universe, though Catwoman will always be my favorite. I've loved her since Batman: Returns and when I found I could play as her in Arkham City I couldn't preorder that game fast enough. I'm also curious about The Huntress now, she seems like a really interesting character and one that I'm not at all familiar with. Though a quick look at Wikipedia (warning, don't go there if you don't want spoilers) shows that she was the main character of Birds of Prey, a show on the WB that I vaguely remember. Huh. I'll have to see what comics I can find at my library that have her in them.Batman will always be my favorite comic hero. I think it's because he doesn't actually have any super powers that I love him so much (it also didn't help that I thought he was pretty *ahem* sexy in the '90s cartoon ...) I will forever hear Batman as Kevin Conroy.I think it's difficult to please fans of any of the long running series, but this graphic novel is pretty much a fan's dream come true. Some might say they mashed too much into the story, too many characters and such, but I think it all really worked to show just how much Batman and Bruce Wayne have been battling over the years.If you're a Batman fan, this story really shouldn't be missed.",28,13
6375845,Batman Hush,Donovan,687,57,5,"May 13, 2021","Hush. It's hush hush, keep the villain a secret. Jeph Loeb said it started out as a joke. But no joke, it's a well written mystery. I'm no mystery expert, nor the world's greatest detective. But you're guessing and second guessing until the very end. So it gets points for high readability and entertainment value alone. Hush is this: Batman is doing his normal rounds when the villains are suddenly acting and fighting with uncharacteristic superiority, and he realizes that someone smarter and more strategic is pulling the strings. But why? And more importantly, who? Turns out that they know Batman intimately and exploit every weakness and predictable response until the very end. Ooo, who's it gonna be?Well, your options are many. Damn near all of the villains are here: Killer Croc, Clayface, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, The Joker, The Riddler, Scarecrow, Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul. And of course two others, whom I can't name to avoid spoilers. I think Mr. Freeze is the only one missing. Jim Lee's artwork, especially the splash pages, with Scott Williams' colors, is absolutely stunning. Lee draws the most dynamic and fluid fights of probably any artist, and Batman fights them all with great athleticism and vigor. There are many heroes: Batman, Tim Drake/Robin, Nightwing, Superman, Catwoman, Huntress, Oracle, and Jim Gordon. This is a character driven story, and they're at their most emotional and personal, real, fragile and caring humans under their masks.Themes of love and loss run throughout, new love mirroring old love and magnifying loss. Both Tommy Elliot and Bruce suffer loss, it binds them together. Yet Batman, apart from professional support, is essentially alone. His pain and thirst for revenge fuel his passion. But at some point the ""monster of fear"" can't always be an absolute. So I appreciate the tenderness between Batman and Catwoman, because that's extremely rare in Bat books, and it's nice to see that Bruce does have a heart. I also wanted to mention that Loeb makes a Knightfall reference. Bruce has a severe injury and Oracle calls Dr. Shondra Kinsolving, who, if you remember, healed his broken back. And Oracle tells Alfred she'll have Dick wreck the Porsche. That was awesome, if you have any idea what I'm talking about. So the mystery isn't perfect. But it ebbs and flows, deepens and twists, keeps you reading, and I'm therefore forgiving. The fights are epic and beautifully illustrated. The villains are viciously skilled. The heroes are tough but fallible. And Gotham, as usual, is a dark throbbing heart of viscerality. I can't find much fault here. Loeb has written a riveting story in true form to Batman. And if you love it, there's an Absolute version available.",23,N/A
6375845,Batman Hush,Sophia,"1,938",172,5,"April 21, 2021","I loved this comic!! The story line, the drawing, the drama, the romance, the mystery, it was all beautiful! This is probably one of my favourite comics I have read so far. I really enjoyed the underlying mystery throughout the entire comic and all the bad guys we get to see! (Also Superman and Lois make a guest appearance and who doesn't love those two? - Lois calls him Smallville *eeek*) The relationship between Batman and Catwoman was so interesting and unique. They have been hinting at their relationship within many of the previous comics and I was seriously happy when they finally admitted they actually liked each other! What annoys me with all the Batman comics I've read, they always do a flashback of the night that Thomas and Martha Wayne were killed. I know that was THE moment in Bruce's life that critically changed him forever but we all know the backstory, we do not need to be reminded of it every 10 pages. Other than that small detail, I thoroughly enjoyed this comic and can't wait to eventually re-read it!",23,1 comment
