42642082,Are You Listening,emma,"1,781",42700,2,"July 16, 2019","the biggest problem i have with graphic novels is always that i never FEEL ANYTHING. there's so little to them. they're like a meringue, and honestly, who likes meringues anyway?but i digress.at the best of times, a graphic novel tends to feel incomplete. this is only truer if that graphic novel contains two separate character arcs, plus a handful of very thorny and complex social issues, plus a near-inexplicable introduction of some very complicated magical realism.basically what i'm saying is that i was incapable of feeling much of anything for these characters, because they never once felt developed to me, and also i had no goddamn idea what was going on for approximately a third of this book.and tragically, neither the fact that it's quite lengthy for a graphic novel or that the art is very very pretty was enough to change that.bottom line: no thank you. except to the art! to that i say yes thank you.----------you had me at ""lgbtq+ magical realism graphic novel with gorgeous illustrations and also it's a road trip""(thanks to first second for the ARC)",99,17
42642082,Are You Listening,s.penkevich,731,4993,3,"August 2, 2021","‘But here, everything is listening.’There is a magic that flows through the works of young graphic novelist superstar Tillie Walden that always keeps me returning to her works, even if just to get lost in the incandescent beauty of her art. Are You Listening?, Walden’s third full-length graphic novel and winner of the 2020 Eisner Award, showcases some her most astounding artwork yet with big, bold color and dynamic energy. The story follows two strangers, Lou and teenage Bea, both running from something who team up on the road across West Texas despite frustration with each other. As they slowly open up to one another and learn that shared empathy can ease the pain of trauma they find themselves caught up in supernatural drama pursued by two mysterious men who will stop at nothing to capture a stray cat the unlikely pair have picked up. While the pacing is a bit uneven and the two storylines never quite mesh, this is still a magical tale of human connection and friendship amidst a world full of pain delivered in such extraordinary art it will take your breath away.This is easily Walden’s finest artistic endeavour yet. Walden’s color palettes—mostly consisting of yellows, oranges, reds and purples on black backgrounds—set an incredibly dreamlike tone that depicts the world around the characters as quietly threatening. The art is much looser that her earlier, more architecturally focused work, and gives a very fluid and energetic quality to the work. She excels at capturing action, with many quick frames per page during dramatic scenes that seemingly overflow into one another and the more surreal moments capture dream logic with each frame practically interjecting itself onto the one before it. This is a masterpiece of art and it is wonderful to have watched Walden perfect her craft and experiment into new territories that all seems to come together to perfection here. This book is worth picking up for the art alone.The story is rather sad, as is to be expected with Walden, yet it is also very hopeful. Walden has a knack for pulling heartstrings like conducting an grand orchestra and this story is certainly moving. Teenage runaway Bea runs into twenty-something Lou on the road, with the older woman deciding to look after the younger girl. Bea is rather guarded and caustic but as the two travel they slowly reveal more about themselves to each other, forming a really beautiful bond by the end of the book despite their many frequent arguments. Their past traumas come to light and the two find that their emotional load is best carried together than alone. Unlike earlier stories, romance never really enters the picture and this is a lovely tale of queer friendship.Slowly building in the background of the story is a mysterious cat that Bea takes in. Two men, always smoking and claiming to be from the Office of Road Inquiry, seem to have a supernatural ability to pursue the two women, always appearing lurking and alarming in the dark. The story takes a magical twist with the cat able to reshape reality around it, though the story surrounding this is rather vague and feels a bit half-baked. It is quite fun, but it also never quite fully blends with the more engaging dialogue-driven storyline of Bea and Lou. While On a Sunbeam let the story breath with a longer length that helped balance out all the elements, this one feel rushed at times (particularly the cat plotline) and a bit more length would be nice. I do enjoy how Walden often leaves elements unexplained, yet here it seems to suffer not from lack of explanation but under-investment in each element. The story ends feeling like it is still reaching for more, which I personally enjoy but what came before it could have been further developed for better emphasis.That said, this is still an extremely impressive work and the art makes it feel fully worth the ride. Heartbreakingly beautiful as always, Walden is one of the best graphic novelists working today, though I would encourage first time readers to start with On a Sunbeam (my absolute favorite) or perhaps Spinning first. I definitely wouldn’t consider this a stumble despite being a bit underwhelmed, more like a jumpy redirection towards a grander horizon. 3.5/5",81,8
42642082,Are You Listening,Thomas,"1,399",8122,3,"December 12, 2019","A sorrowful and hopeful graphic novel that follows two women on a road trip through West Texas, both struggling to process and move past their respective traumas and grief. Not much happens in this story plot-wise, which gives space for Bea and Lou’s quiet and caring interactions to take center stage. Their friendship felt like the softly shining center of Are You Listening?, how they learn to trust one another despite their painful pasts and their stress on the trip. At its strongest, Are You Listening? serves as a poignant exemplar of the power of sharing your heart with another person, no matter how shameful or scary that sharing may feel. The artwork adds an element of eeriness and beauty to the story. By the end of the book I found myself wanting more: a little more depth in Bea and Lou’s friendship, a little more backstory, a little more processing of their experiences. Yet I so appreciate Are You Listening? for what it does offer, and I applaud Tillie Walden’s sensitive handling of a plotline related to sexual assault. Looking forward to reading more of Walden’s work in the future and I feel grateful for a graphic novel that highlights the healing capacity of friendship, an undervalued form of relationship in contemporary society.",56,2

42642082,Are You Listening,Ideas are bulletproof ,106,62,4,"October 17, 2021","An absolutely heart breaking and appealing graphic novel! This tells the story of two girls and a long car drive accompanied by a peculiar cat. Lou is visiting her family and Bea has run away from home for reasons unknown…they both meet and decide to go on a road trip that could possibly make them go through all sorts of hazardous deeds and vicious people. On the way, they talk about their life and all the unsettling things either of them had to go through long ago as a kid. They talked about how helpless they felt back then and how they never fought back…On the whole, I definitely recommend this book! The illustrations were magnificent and the storyline didn’t bore me one bit!",28,N/A

This was so, so intense. I didn't know that this had fabulist elements in it, so I was a little bit caught off guard by that but this was so powerful and well done.I read an ARC, so I don't know how this is gonna look fully coloured but the first couple of pages were already so promising and in general the art is absolutely beautiful. I could imagine that I'd give this five stars if I reread a finished copy!Trigger warnings for rape.♦ Booktube Channel ♦ Twitter ♦ Instagram ♦This was gifted to me by the wonderful Melanie 💜💜",19,N/A

The road, the cloud, the trees… they know all your secrets. Everything you’ve seen is built by you. Which is why you’ll never see it again.”Are You Listening? is a beautiful piece of magical realism, with enough mystery and heart to make it refreshingly profound as well as easily re-readable. I’d not only recommend it to fans of Walden’s previous work, but also to anyone looking for one of the most original graphic novels I’ve read in a long time.For fans of: Texas, Road Trips, Ridiculous Talent",18,N/A

42642082,Are You Listening,Mir,"4,778",4983,3,"January 14, 2020","While they were all well executed, I didn't feel that the separate strands (the two travelers fleeing their individual woes; the cat; the never-really-explained supernatural  pursuers) meshed very well. The shift from magical realism to surrealism and back was a bit odd.This might work better for a reader who has any associations with West Texas or is familiar with the landscape, but I have nothing beside a couple old country songs that make me think I never want to visit. This book certainly didn't change that opinion.I didn't find either the art or the story as interesting as my previous read by this author, On a Sunbeam.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",16,2
42642082,Are You Listening,ash | spaceyreads,341,204,4,"January 6, 2020","Are You Listening is a graphic novel about a magic, surreal road trip with two LGBTQIA characters. Cushioned against a backdrop of winding roads is the budding friendship between Lou and Bea, an adult woman and a young teen, both running away from past trauma of their own. Fresh from their own wounds, Lou and Bea's interactions show the tenderness that trauma leaves you with, and how it feels like to hold it, give it space, and share that with someone who cares. I love the symbolism of the magical realism plot and how it parallels the journey of coming to terms with your trauma. It a beautiful metaphor and it flows with Bea and Lou's journey. As they run further from their hurt, the roads seem to stretch on forever and they got lost. And more comes when they have to confront it, and eventually, find ways to seek comfort and solace.
  ""Are you listening? None of this is your fault.""
I feel that Walden could have delved more into talking about the trauma, and exploring more in depth the complex feelings and ways of coping Lou and Bea may have tried. Perhaps it was her intention to leave it lightly touched on. That Lou and Bea opened up tentatively and without saying too much to each other is definitely much closer to reality than the narrative that you have to pour it all out.Overall it was beautiful, touching, and helped me through some bad times of my own. Stories like these make me feel less alone.",14,2

They set off on a road trip to West Texas. As the two get to know each other, emotional information is brought to light, Lou tries to be the mentor Bea never had. This was... interesting. Half the time I was a bit confused on what was actually going on. At one point I think there was a magical cat? I liked the mix of coloured and black and white panels, I think it worked well for the atmosphere of the graphic novel. I liked Bea and Lou as characters and how they each leaned on each other in their time of need. ",12,N/A
