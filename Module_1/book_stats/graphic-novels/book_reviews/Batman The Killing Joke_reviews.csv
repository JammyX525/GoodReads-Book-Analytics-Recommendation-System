96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,5,"November 22, 2020","“All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.”Now this was good, and I mean good. It’s such a simple idea, but so real and powerful. I mean one bad day is all it takes. One push, one snap, one descent into chaos and it’s over. Once you’ve crossed that threshold then things will never be the same again. And the Joker, being the sly and brilliant villain that he is, wants to share the experience with the world. He wants to show humanity that they are not that far from him. The first man he wants to reduce is the stalwart Commissioner Gordon. But, I think we all know who is intended victim actually is.  The Joker was once normal. He had a girlfriend; he had a job, but the world shitted on him somewhat chronic. And like many people he was forced to turn to crime; he was forced to break society's rules in order to survive. That’s where it all began. That first step into the darkness led to many other steps down the road of corruption. It wasn’t long before petty crime turned to murder and butchery. The Joker became ruined and lost himself in his nasty deeds. This is a great origin story, one that fully lives up to the character immense personality. Allan More totally nails it. ""THERE IS NO SANITY CLAUSE! SO WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF LOCKED ONTO AN UNPLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT, HEADING FOR THE PLACES IN YOUR PAST WHERE THE SCREAMING IS UNBEARABLE, REMEMBER THERE'S ALWAYS MADNESS. MADNESS IS THE EMERGENCY EXIT... YOU CAN JUST STEP OUTSIDE, AND CLOSE THE DOOR ON ALL THOSE DREADFUL THINGS THAT HAPPENED. YOU CAN LOCK THEM AWAY... FOREVER.”And the ending, it’s all about the ending. The Joker’s personality is infectious. At least, he wants it to be. He’s always tried to bring down the good. He ruined Harvey Dent, and he has always wanted to ruin the bat. And he just may have. The end is suggestive of two things: firstly, Batman strangling the Joker in one final heroic act, there’s some irony in that sentence; secondly, Batman descending to the Jokers level and embracing the insanity of one bad day.I'll leave you with this picture and see if you can decide:__________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________",334,12
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Anne,"3,785",6900,5,"April 19, 2020","All it takes is one bad day.This is one of the most iconic comics in the Batman/Joker mythos and arguably has a place as one of the most iconic comics out there period. I think most people will agree that Bolland's visuals are just unbelievable. The expressions on the faces, the body language, even the colors are as close to perfect as you can get.And Moore is at the top of his game here. Wow. Just...wow!The ripple effects of what happened here not only created Oracle, but inspired a ton of other great storylines.I would have thought that a Joker Origin story was maybe the stupidest idea ever before reading this, but I think Moore pulled it off beautifully. Mainly because this had such a wonderful hint of madness to it, that it even with the Joker telling you about his past, it still leaves you wondering if that's really what happened.And that ending.Highly recommended.",257,42
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,5,"July 3, 2022","Of course, there are no real life Arkham Asylums, because this would have some pretty bad implications for models of society in general besides the „It takes one bad day approach.“  For instance critical questions like Who runs and makes money with these institutions, just as with prisons?Why this high incarceration rate in the US?Is there an open debate about restorative and retributive justice models? Wouldn´t making much more people crazy on purpose produce more cash flow for the madhouse just as making stricter laws produce prison slave labor? So let´s better stick with the cozy world of graphic novels and enter the lovely universe of… oh wait, there was something.Good straight moralityhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...getting contaminatedhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...until it Jokers´ outhttps://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...This underlying question of morality, ethic, and who says what is ok (burning evil witches, killing evil infidels, investing in hedge funds and financial derivates) and not is what makes many great works, although just rarely with such fantastic manifestations as the Joker. Because he´s deep and the morality most appropriate for him might be https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.ph...Batman or the Joker? And is it a BDSM Bromance that doesn´t just end with them laughing together, but an even bigger, unknown, inofficial ending before the police comes?So there is this one guy fighting for the state, police, corporations, society, and all the mad criminals that are…born that way? Decided to do that because they realized that it made them hard? No, wait, it are the good ones, the superrich bat with his investments, the politicians with their lobbyists, the whole rotten system itself that produces these poor individuals themselves. That´s the postmodernist deconstruction of everything that was once nice and cozy and throwing back the body of proof to the ones who deem themselves judges.  The „It takes one bad day approach“ could evolve into boot camps for moneybagsLike many psychological real life studies, this is just not scientific. I´m sure that, repeated with loads of naked people in different vehicles and soft porn, there will be as many outcomes as stabilities of psyches themselves. Some might enjoy it, some get PTSD, and for some, it´s not even hardcore enough. But the idea of showing wealthy, protected people who don´t know what real life and suffering means the darkness of many existences is a nice idea to get them to start thinking. Maybe as kind of boot camps for the elite who have to work in average and low paying bone breaking jobs with breadline, poverty, violence, and discrimination. Wouldn´t that be fun? Bleach the clown I´m sure that there is certainly a deeper meaning too, something like that narcissism and egocentrism are so omnipresent in our society that, after many miseries have shattered the poor pal, his disfigurement is the missing puzzle piece to ultimate madness. Joker speeches and mentalityThey´re distillations of the underlying, mentioned themes and the most disturbing thing is the fact that he really has some points. While Batman is the sober, philistine moralizer who can´t get out of his skin, the Joker's argumentation is as flexible as possible and sometimes more realistic than the pathetic, patriotic approach that ignores vast parts of reality for the sake of a meaningless glorification of pathos. That´s why Antagonists are sometimes the true rebels and freedom fightersEspecially in the historical context, this is a pretty freaking big history mind penetration. Close to all real life big heroes, national icons, be they kings or presidents, had blood on their hands and contamination in their brains because of the ideologies that fueled their periods. Most of these mutations of humanities are seen as inhumane, crazy, and destructive nowadays, but where agendas and commandments centuries and, more important, just decades ago. So everyone rebelling against these systems, no matter how violent and cruel, is somehow unwittingly making the world a better place by sensitizing and alerting the public. Our nowadays, violent and nonviolent resistance activists, modern Jokers, are just treated like the mad peasants criticizing duke and king, slaves wanting freedom, women wanting rights, etc. So it may be possible that they´re right and we just not crazy enough to understand and see the truth.

96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Lyn,"1,845",16300,4,"December 12, 2019","I asked a GR friend: Marvel or DC?Her response made me think. She said, “Marvel over all. But DC has the better villains.”Whu - ?Well.Yeah, I’ll be damned, I think she’s right.Looking at all of the Marvel villains, I think maybe only Red Skull or Bullseye come close to matching the lunatic force of DC’s lineup. Magneto and Doctor Doom are powerful and bad, but also have some incongruous redeeming qualities. Lex Luthor, Deathstroke, Brainiac, Bane, Harley Quinn and all the Batman bad guys headlined by The Joker are more nefarious, scarier, and just plain bad.I think a cogent argument could be made that The Joker is THE comics villain. He’s evil, insane and damn it all interesting as hell.Just as Milton’s most enduringly intriguing player is not God or the Archangels but Satan, DC has in The Joker created an enigma (Sorry Riddler) of a criminal source that defies logic and is simply an opposing force for our heroes, motives and reason be damned. The Joker is a personification of the chaos waiting out in the dark beyond the firelight, and his is a blindly malevolent force. As Michael Caine’s Alfred in the 2008 film The Dark Knight said, “some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.”“All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.” In his attempt to madden Gordon and lure Batman to his doom, The Joker also provides a tenuous connection to humanity. Just as Shakespeare’s Richard III is all the more terrible because he is a man, so too is The joker all the more villainous because for all his insanity and bad intent, he is one of us and closer than some Melvillian beast or Lovecraftian old god. In the context of the Batman story, the theatrical irony the reader gets is that Joker and Batman are more alike than they realize, both transformed from what they would have been by a traumatic loss.Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s 1988 sympathetic backstory to the Joker’s origin story is a MUST read for Moore fans, Batman devotees and all enthusiasts of the genre. The influence on later comics and even on the films (particularly Tim Burton’s vision) is unmistakable.Grim, violent, sometimes difficult to look at, this is nonetheless a graphic novel at the apex of the genus. Moore’s writing is engaging and relentless, Bolland’s art is mesmerizing.Highly recommended.",152,11

  A truly masterpiece of the comic books!

  HAVE COURAGE

  Nothing’s going to be the same… …not ever again.
A writer should have balls, and I don’t mean the organic meat sacs, since a female writer is the same entitled to have balls. But if you aren’t confortable with the “male metaphor”, I am confident that you already got that I am talking about writing with courage.A writer without courage never will be able to impact the readers. Madonna commented many years ago that there is not such thing as bad publicity, that any publicity is good publicity.So, fitting that concept into writing, I think that there isn’t such thing as “bad impact”, that any impact is good impact. Since if people talk about a book, about a story, not matter their intention, the story becomes famous, it provokes curiousity, people got aware of it.Alan Moore never thought that DC Comics would approve his proposal about this Batman’s story involving the crippling of Barbara Gordon. But it was approved by the editorial staff, and a surprised Alan Moore started to write… with courage. I am not insensitive, and I can understand why so many people got angry to the nasty stuff that the character of Barbara Gordon suffered in this story. However, sometimes a bad thing happened for a good reason. Barbara Gordon was Batgirl. But, to be honest, how much difference can she does as such heroine? She was just yet another bat-costumed crime-fighter and trust me, for Batman, that he’s supposed to be a “lonely crusader”, he has too many bat-costumed crime-fighters around. However, due her awful episode in The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon proved her value as character… proved her courage. Barbara Gordon became a handicapped person, but hardly of disappearing from the pages of comics, she evolved into “Oracle”, and as such persona, she turned to be one of the most powerful characters in the DC Universe. From her wheelchair, using her intelligence, hacking skills and information searches, she became a key ally to not only the Bat-family but also the Titans and even the Justice League.And then… due social pressure from people that never really understood the value of Barbara Gordon, DC Comics devolved her to be Batgirl again. Yipee, hurray (using Droopy’s voice tone). Yet another bat-costumed throwing-batarangs character again, one of many others. All her courage overcoming a monumental tragedy, just erased.And curious that people raged against what Barbara suffered but nobody gave a crap about James Gordon’s own suffering and humiliation, but of course, if you are a heterosexual caucasian man (even if you are an imaginary character reflecting that type of person)… you’re screwed, since nobody will defend your dignity. (and hey, I am a latin man, so since I am part of a “minority” group, if you attack my review, I am in my “right” of accusing you of a racist/ethnic hate act… geez! What a crazy world where we live in!)It seems that villains can do all the harm and killing that they wish, BUT only if they target heterosexual caucasian men, since it seems that any other type of people in this world is under the label of some “minority” group and therefore, there will be rage riots about it.I think that “labels” instead of unite us, they just keep away the distance between each other in this little blue planet. People see me as a heterosexual latin man. And I can’t deny that. That’s what I am in the eyes of society. I born that way……However, I’d prefer to be a “citizen of the world”. But maybe I am crazy, since it looks like everybody else feels confortable under the safety of their particular sex/ethnic labels.And call me crazy again, but it seems that in real life, criminals just pick any kind of victim, regardless of their sexual preferences or ethnic origins, just watch the news anyday, so I don’t understand why literature should present politically correct villains only.Writers! Don’t lose your courage! It’s not an easy path, but true born writers aren’t meant to travel in safe roads. We, readers, are an unthankful species, we don’t deserve you. However, I hope that you, writers, still being willing to impact us, to make us think, and to provoke us feelings.
  ONE (VERY) BAD DAY

  How can two people hate so much without knowing each other?
Batman is a cause of order. Joker is a force of chaos. Right?Therefore, they are totally different. Right?THAT is the killing joke……they aren’t that different.One bad day. That was all they needed to get crazy.You may tell me: “Oh! But only Joker is crazy!”. Right. Since disguising as a bat is clearly a sanity’s proof.Joker’s origins are unknown (since you can’t trust what you read in this tale about his past, after all, those are the memories of an insane killer), but you can be sure that something bad, something very bad, happened to him, one day, and the following day, he turned to be The Joker.Bruce Wayne had a bad day, a very bad day, his parents died in front of him while he was still just a defenseless kid, and the following day, he turned to be The Batman (training could take years, but he was The Batman since that moment).The Joker kills people in very theatrical ways.The Batman protects people in very theatrical ways.Gotham City is in the middle……in the hands of murdering clowns and costumed vigilantes……in the hands of mad men.The only one that keeps Gotham City from falling deep into madness?James Gordon.The Joker will do everything (and I mean EVERYTHING!) to give to James Gordon, a bad day, a very bad day, and turned him crazy.But that’s not the scariest thing……oh, no……that isn’t the killing joke.The scariest thing is when two people, supposed to be opposites……they laugh for the same joke.BOOM!Mic drop, and I’m outta here!",115,21
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Fabian,933,1525,4,"March 16, 2020","The Killing Joke does much more for the iconic symbolism & stylistic edge of the Batman mythology than the serious-as-a-heart attack (overrated) Christopher Nolan films. But I am admittedly really in no position to analyze,* I leave this to the millions and lkegions of fans.

(Watchmen, From Hell, even Fashion Beast...)* Well, I will say I do have the fondest memories of the fox animated series-the Mad Hatter being my favorite (underutilized) villain.** This cover is probably as iconographic as Edvard Munch's 'The Scream' at this point.",81,4
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Jeff ,912,674,4,"January 6, 2016","Should some origin stories be better left untold? Comic publishers will embellish the backstory of character more than necessary or drag it out and milk it, or they’ll retcon the character one too many times until the reader doesn’t know which way is up. If there’s a month, a week, a day, a couple of minutes left undocumented in a character’s background, it’ll be fodder for a future story.Does the Joker need an origin story? Some basic facts are presented here: He was once “normal”. He became a small time criminal out of necessity. He inadvertently gets dumped into a vat of Kool-Ade chemicals by Batman. As a result, he goes stark, raving bonkers.How much more of the Joker’s backstory do we want to be privy to? Do we need to add the fact that he was a struggling stand-up comedian and had a pregnant wife to the mix? Is sympathy necessary to appreciate and like the character even more? The Joker’s persona is established as a homicidal loon, but do we have to be there at square one? Can his “accident” really turn him from an ordinary guy to a criminal mastermind, divorced of all humanity? Can the collective comic reader brain fill in the blanks themselves, leaving something to the imagination and not have it spoon fed to us? Do we need the complete story?Back in the ‘80’s, before the ‘90’s when collectors nearly killed off the industry (Psst. Hey mister, you wanna buy a truckload of alternate foil #1 issues of Spider-Man 2099?), comic book creators were expanding the kiddie-geared bounds of storytelling by getting edgy and no one was more on board with the movement to more mature themes than Alan Moore, hence his interest in the Joker’s story.This isn’t a Batman book. Bats comes off as weak, conciliatory, a step behind the Joker, his arch-nemesis. Sure I get the oft presented theory that they’re two parts to a whole, ying to the yang, “you complete me”, “let’s stop the madness, because one of us is going to die” yada, yada, yada… Here, Batman is a second banana.The Joker even gets the better of Batman in combat! More than once!C’mon Bats, you didn’t see that coming with your ninja skillz and training?Brian Bolland’s art is exceptional and sells the story far better than Moore’s writing. That said, this a graphic novel that fans of Batman and the super hero genre should check out, if they haven’t done so already. It’s a defining moment in the Batman family legend and a game changer for Barbara Gordon -> Batgirl -> Oracle.Bottom line: This book has some panels that will be burned into your brain for the rest of your life. The Joker shooting Barbara Gordon usually makes top five lists of most memorable comic moments. Seeing Commissioner Gordon trussed up naked and led around an abandoned amusement park by creepy, deranged midgets and driven to the edge of insanity is something I’d like to mind wipe.“Top of the pile of dolls, Ma!!”",80,9

THE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AMAZING!I'm sure everyone and their cousin has already read this book, but I haven't so here we go. This is about how the joker turned nutsy cuckoo! He had a good job but left it thinking he could be a stand up comedian and support his wife and unborn baby. Well.... that didn't happen, he apparently wasn't funny --->who knew?Then he goes and tries to get some crime job with some idiots so he could have the money until he could figure something out. Being out in a warehouse with said ""idiots"".. he has some stupid mask on, they get chased by security, he falls in some chemical crap and comes out whackadoo. I think it's brilliant. Then he goes and shoots batgirl, kidnaps the commissioner and puts him in some freak show at a carnival he bought (or stole). It's just all so freaky and cool!

  5.5 stars!!!
OH…MY…GOD… I thought I knew everything there was to know about the Joker, one of Batman’s greatest foes. But after reading “Batman: The Killing Joke” and how the Joker was portrayed in this book, the Joker has officially become one of the most VILE, TWISTED, DARK and most DISTURBING villain I have ever come face to face with…AND I LOVED IT! Being brilliantly written by Alan Moore and being masterfully illustrated by Brian Bolland, “Batman: The Killing Joke” has remained to be one of the greatest and most disturbing “Batman” stories to ever be created!
  What is the story?
 When it turns out that the Joker, one of Batman’s greatest foes, breaks out of Arkham Asylum, Batman must stop this evil doer at all costs. Unfortunately, the Joker then comes after Commissioner Gordon and his daughter Barbara and performs some of the most vile and disturbing acts in his villainous career (starts by shooting Barbara Gordon, paralyzing her and then twisting Commissioner Gordon’s mind to make him crazy) and Batman must stop the Joker before it is too late. Also, we are introduced to the back story of the Joker and how he became the villain he is known as today. 
  What I loved about this comic:
Alan Moore’s writing: WOW! I mean, I thought that I have read some of the best Batman stories around (“Batman: Year One” for starters), but I think that “Batman: The Killing Joke” has nearly beaten some of the best “Batman” stories I had read! I had read some of Alan Moore’s works (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen), but I can easily say that this graphic novel is easily one of his best works! I loved the way that Alan Moore made this story extremely disturbing and dark and I was actually cringing during the scene where Barbara Gordon is shot and then tortured, which proved how demented the Joker really is. I also loved the way that Alan Moore portrayed the relationship between Batman and the Joker since it is rare that I see a hero and a villain have a sort of understandable relationship seeing as how they both had lost people dear to them, but viewed life in a different life. I enjoyed the psychological message that Alan Moore was presenting in this story as the Joker sees life as being a huge awful joke (meaning that life is miserable) while Batman is truly trying to see the reality of the situations in life. I really enjoyed seeing the back story of the Joker as we learn what he was like before he became the villain he is known today and that really added so much depth to the story and to the character of the Joker. The ending of this story was truly terrifying yet amazing to see at the same time (I will not spoil it for you, but let us just say it is the confrontation between Batman and the Joker).Brian Bolland’s artwork: Brian Bolland had done a truly amazing job at providing the artwork of this story as all the characters look truly realistic and colorful. I loved the attention in details that Brian Bolland gives to the characters’ facial expressions, especially the Joker as he is seen smiling dementedly, which makes him a truly menacing character to look at. My favorite artwork in this graphic novel was of the images of the rain drops making small circles in the ground, as they look truly beautiful and yet give this story a truly ominous feel as these images appear at the beginning of the book towards the end of the book.
  What made me feel uncomfortable about this book:
 The only issue with this graphic novel that some readers would have problems with is the fact that the story is extremely dark and disturbing for your average “Batman” story. For one thing, there is a scene where Barbara Gordon is shot and then tortured which would disturb many readers (it definitely disturbed me a bit). Also, as in many “Batman” stories, the atmosphere of this story is extremely dark and brooding and that might be a bit uncomfortable for many readers who are not used to reading dark stories to handle.
  Final Thoughts:
So what is my final verdict on this story? “Batman: The Killing Joke” is easily one of the most disturbing yet most amazing stories I have ever read and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this story to “Batman” fans everywhere who love a good dark and intelligent story about the follies of life.Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog",68,41
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Tim,467,578,5,"May 15, 2020","This is not the perfect Batman story. It’s got several weird choices, some extremely offensive moments and one of the most infamous scenes of violence towards a female character in comic history (story goes that when Moore mentioned the idea of damaging Barbara Gordon’s spine, the higher ups at DC responded to him with “Fine, cripple the bitch”). Flaws aside, it is the perfect Joker story.These random acts of violence, these weird choices and offensive mockeries… they fit the Joker’s twisted sense of humor. It shows him at his cruelest.It also shows him at his most sympathetic.Alan Moore took his considerable talents and applied it to reworking the Joker’s backstory; to making it absolutely depressing and then adding in the element that the Joker himself is not even sure if it's correct. What’s important is that he believes it… at least at the time. The artwork is stunning (especially in the recolored version that is currently in print) and shows the Joker, while almost always grinning, always with sad eyes. I mean seriously, just look at him.   This is one of those comics that needs to be experienced. I could go on at length, but could never do it justice. My suggestion is to just check it out for yourself.Let me close though with the Joker’s monologue. It’s long, but says more about his character than I ever could, and is one of the best written I’ve ever seen in a comic.""So... I see you received the free ticket I sent you. I'm glad. I did so want you to be here. You see it doesn't matter if you catch me and send me back to the asylum... Gordon's been driven mad. I've proved my point. I've demonstrated there's no difference between me and everyone else! All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day. You had a bad day once, am I right? I know I am. I can tell. You had a bad day and everything changed. Why else would you dress up as a flying rat? You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else... Only you won't admit it! You have to keep pretending that life makes sense, that there's some point to all this struggling! God you make me want to puke. I mean, what is it with you? What made you what you are? Girlfriend killed by the mob, maybe? Brother carved up by some mugger? Something like that, I bet. Something like that... Something like that happened to me, you know. I... I'm not exactly sure what it was. Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice! Ha ha ha! But my point is... My point is, I went crazy. When I saw what a black, awful joke the world was, I went crazy as a coot! I admit it! Why can't you? I mean, you're not unintelligent! You must see the reality of the situation. Do you know how many times we've come close to world war three over a flock of geese on a computer screen? Do you know what triggered the last world war? An argument over how many telegraph poles Germany owed its war debt creditors! Telegraph poles! Ha ha ha ha HA! It's all a joke! Everything anybody ever valued or struggled for... it's all a monstrous, demented gag! So why can't you see the funny side? Why aren't you laughing?""5/5 stars",61,5
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,Sarah,391,135,4,"April 30, 2018","Just finished rereading this. It’s still such a cool comic! *Batman voice* ""WHERE IS HE?"" I can see why this is so popular. The story is great and the illustrations are phenomenal. I love the Joker, he's my favourite batman villain (and possibly my all-time favourite comic/superhero villain too). He is just completely insane and I love it. I love getting backstories so I loved getting to see an adaptation of why the Joker was the way he was. It was really well done. However, after reading this I felt a little conflicted. One big reason why I love the Joker is because he is quite mysterious. He's insane and because you don't know why, it makes him scarier. So Moore wrote this great back story BUT part of me wasn't really completely satisfied. I only realised after I read this, that the mystery was a big issue for me. Batman was such a douche in this (even more than usual). I love Batman but I don't think Moore wrote him as a very likeable character. I actually liked the ending a lot. I was smiling because I thought it was sweet. I know the ending is ambiguous and open to interpretation but I consider it a happy ending. This comic was actually quite philosophical. I kept reading things that reminded me of different philosophers I've studied. I especially liked the Joker's speech about insanity and reason. THE BEST thing about this was 100% the artwork. It is absolutely beautiful. It's crisp, clean, very detailed and the colours are just perfect. I was fangirling at how great the art was in every single panel. Brian Bollard is brilliant.I would recommend this and I'll definitely be reading more from Moore and Bollard.",60,8
96358,Batman The Killing Joke,the burning dreamer.,266,546,4,"December 7, 2016","An accurate depiction of what these 45 minutes felt like:Nolan's movies are the reason I got hooked into the world of Batman. Not only did they become some of my favourite films of all time, but they also gave me one of my favourite villains of all time: The Joker.And I figured it was about damn time I took a leap into where it all actually began– the comics.There's no doubt that this green-haired madman is universally hailed as perhaps the best antagonist to have ever been created, and one can easily see why that is. The Killing Joke presents us with his backstory: a deeper insight into the man the Joker once was, and the events that led to the loss of his sanity. Whether or not you like the inclusion of this origin is entirely subjective but as for me, I feel like it only further added to this brilliant criminal mastermind's many layers and complexities (and dare I say it, even a strong sense of sympathy). The story centrally revolves around the Joker's sadistic quest to prove that all it takes is ""one bad day"" for a person to lose their mind, whilst flickering between flashbacks and current events, using beautifully done match-cut techniques. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
More than that, this graphic novel showcased some incredibly smart dialogue, iconic Batman moments and commendable artwork from Brian Bolland. And can I just say how pleased I am at his decision to recolour the deluxe version? It does wonders in setting the right, creepy atmosphere, just take a look!
  
While it does a spectacular job at representing the turbulent relationship shared between Batman and his ultimate archenemy, I do feel it shouldn't have been the book to pop my DC comics cherry– had I read previous editions first, I would have relished it even more.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",56,2
