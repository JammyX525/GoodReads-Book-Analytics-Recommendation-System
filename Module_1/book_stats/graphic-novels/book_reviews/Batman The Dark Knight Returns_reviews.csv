 HOLY ASSCLOWNS BATMANand don’t forget (though I know you WANT TO)
  
  UHH, UMM....I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO THIS AS IT IS JUST TOO PAINFUL....WAITER....CHECK PLEASE!!!!...BUT THANKFULLY................................AFTER ""The Dark Knight Returns"".................... WE WERE GIVEN........
  
  HOLY REVERSAL OF FORTUNE, THE DARK KNIGHT IS A SCARY DUDE AGAIN 
  
 OH, I GET IT NOW....THE JOKER IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PSYCHOTIC, HOMICIDAL MANIAC AND NOT AN UNDERSTUDY TO CHARLES NELSON REILLY THANK YOU KIND SIR FOR RESTORING MY FAITH IN THE COMIC MEDIUM!!OKAY, NUFF HISTORY....ON WITH THE REVIEW!!!5.0 to 5.5 stars. One of the most influential graphic novels of all time, this amazing story single-handedly resurrected the character of Batman as ""the Dark Knight"" after the 70s and early 80s had turned him, thanks in large part to the success of the television show, into a light-hearted, campy hero (I refer you back to the history lesson above). This story pushed reset and Batman once again became the dark, fanatic, often ruthless character he was created to be. As important as WHAT this graphic novel did for Batman specifically, it had an even greater impact on comics in general. Prior to the publication of “The Dark Knight Returns,” the entire comics industry was sagging and had lost a significant percentage of its fan base. The popularity of Frank Miller’s visionary work of this book led to a whole new era in comics. Following its success, comics saw the creation of very popular “anti-heros” like Wolverine and  the Punisher, both of which were inspired by Miller’s version of the Dark Knight. In addition, the comic world began to see ""darker, edgier"" versions of classic characters being aimed at more mature audiences (e.g., Batman, Green Arrow, Daredevil, The Sandman). In Summary, I would say that for all of its historical significance, the best reason to read this is that it is truly a great work of fiction and one that gets my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION as it is.......

59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Anne,"3,785",6900,4,"May 1, 2020","Because the best kind of classic has pictures... So. I've actively (and successfully) avoided reading TDKR for many years now.Why, you ask?Well, to be honest, I was kinda scared. Now, if you aren't a comic book reader, then you might not understand how big of a deal this book is, but if you are...?Yeah, you know.Which means, you're also aware of all the rabid comic nerds out there who go all stabby when you don't like their favorite character, publisher, title, bobblehead action figure...the list goes on.Hey, I'm not judging! I'm one of those nerds. Believe me, I know how dangerous it can be to wade into dork shark infested waters.And if (God forbid) I wrote a review saying I didn't like this?! I've picked this up from the library multiple times, flipped through it, stuck it in my bag, and then took it back to my local branch at my earliest convenience.Because.deep breathBecause of the huge amount of dialogue, and all those fucking Talking Heads! I mean, for real, Miller? You're killing my tiny dinosaur brain with all of those woooooords. And the art? Weeeeeell...It's kinda ugly. <--personal opinionSometimes the characters look like they're lumpy or something. Perhaps Miller & Janson envisioned a world where everyone was made of congealed oatmeal or cottage cheese?  ducks, runsOk. Put your pitchforks down!Jesbus. Touchy. Anyway, I ended up finally giving in, giving up, and giving TDKR a fair shot, sigh because my teenage son wanted to read it. Which, maybe wouldn't have been enough to turn the tide all by itself, but right around the same time (serendipity?) a friend here on Goodreads was kind enough to gift me a copy. And then bug me till I read it.Plus, after my son got done with it, he basically shoved it at me while making all these weird squealing fanboy noises. <--please don't tell him I said that!So.I read it.And I really enjoyed it!Whoduthunkit?! Not me, that's for sure. I assumed this would probably go down as one of those comics that I had to read, but didn't really like. Sure, sure...its importance for Batman mythos can't be denied, but that doesn't always equal something that can stand the test of time. And it especially doesn't mean that someone with my pea-sized tolerance for dry/crunchy/old comics will savor the reading experience.But I did.This was a great Batman story, but not quite what I would call 5 star stuff in 2016. Those Heads just...yeesh, they almost did me in! The cluttered feel of so many of the pages kept me from wanting to linger, and the knobbly faces of the characters were (at times) a turnoff.BUT.The story itself was fantastic. It was just as gritty and dark as I was promised, but there was also a glimmer of hope to it that I wasn't expecting.It caught me off guard and made me smile.Overall, I thought this was good stuff!",185,228

Aging also doesn´t really help in a world that hasn´t become better since he began his crusade against crime and injustice, so he has to  Strongly rely on tech compensating the fading reflexes and strengthA not real superhero, just made of tech like Batman and Ironman, is more sympathetic and easier to relate to and identify with than the mutants, aliens, wizards, and people born with these powers. But not even winning under dire circumstances can make Bruce happy, because  Human nature sucksEven after some success against the dark side, the whole victory gets toxic because the proselytized baddies are so overachieving that they satirize the whole doing good concept even more than Batman himself. Not to speak of the ethical and philosophical implications of what is really good and bad in individual and meta contexts. In both this aspect and its deeper meaning and innuendos it kind of Reminds me of WatchmenLike no other graphic novel I´ve read so far. But because I´m still a genre rookie, that might just be a subjective fail, but I won´t beg for forgiveness like a battened criminal. There is no real hope, the world is depressing, and the only main difference between the two works is the integration of fantasy elements in Watchmen. In both cases, the really big deal is to Compare the movie and the graphic novelTo milk massive mind penetrations of how complex these things are. Just as in conventional, colorless literature, there is such a deep layer of big history, postmodernist deconstruction, dark satire, and loads of innuendos and connotations that it´s just a joy to see all the Potemkin villages of functioning, fair Western fringe sockpuppet democracies collapse under the intellectual vacuum created by poor, abused voodoo humanities. The rotten core is so bigoted, inhuman, and cynical that in the end Hope fails epicallyThanks to bad old school psychiatry and conservative right wing politicians. Both of these elements are so freaking complex that one could go forever vivisecting them, but let´s just say Ronald Reagan got roasted and that repeating psychological and psychiatric studies leads to interesting replication crisis catastrophes shaking the foundations of humanities. Even  Adding Superman to the mix can´t create a happy endingWhen 2 heroes, one truly superpowered and the other one gifted with technical ingenuity and physical, once, superiority, are unable to fight the system, what should one little, weak human being do against these sinister forces? Maybe online socializing, organizing, and thereby eco social improving the world instead of trolling, hating, and fake newsing? Wait, that was too optimistic for the dark tone of this novel, I mean we are doooomed and all hope is gone.

59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Khurram,"1,510",6637,5,"December 28, 2022","really enjoyed this comic; I keep wondering why it took me so long to read it. I finally got around to reading it after being blown away by Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 (Region 2) and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns - Part 2 [DVD]. I thought it was finally time to get round to the source material. I am glad I did.I quick recap of the story. Bruce is no longer Batman. There has been no Batman for 10 years. To curb his urges Bruce has become something of an adrenalin junkie study. Gotham has become a darker and more lawless place. On the 10 year anniversary of the last Batman sighting Bruce's subconscious ""Batman"" fights back telling him Bruce he is just the shell and he is not done with him yet.Most of what I though was great about the movies holds true to the comic, with a couple of exception. I have to say I prefer the animation of the movies, but I think at the time of the comic and for what is trying to be portrayed it does work. Meaning Batman strikes from the shadow leaving his opponent incapacitated and confused as to what just happened. A couple of the panels like when Batman takes out the pimp in the back of the taxi I it took me a while to see what happened from the art work. Like I said these were surgical strikes and it does put me in the mind of the pimp with a broken hand, thinking my hand is broken what just happened. When Batman decides to show himself the art work reflects that by drawing bigger more detailed pictures of him. The main thing I did not like about the comic was I thought there was too much of the talking heads. The media discussions of Batman, I can understand why this was done e.g. the Arkem psychologist taking an anti-batman stance to sell more of his book and make a name for himself, but I think it was a bit overdone. I mean all together this probably makes up half the contents of the book. The best think about the comic and it major advantage over the movies is the internal dialog Batman has with himself. In the movies they make Batman talk more to explain his methods. Whereas if you look at the comics there are very few speech bubbles while he is Batman and most of these are orders or threats. The rest of them it is Batman analysing everything in his head. I think that is what makes his scarier, (like when a magic trick is explained it is not as impressive), having the unknown factor is what Batman his edge. An example of this is in the second fight with the Mutant Leader, the Leader cannot understand Batman is targeting nerve clusters and showing him shallow cuts in the ""just the right"" places can be effective. I also like the way he keep thinking lucky with every near miss, and the explanation of why he paints a big bright target on his chest. I also like the way Batman has evolved, he is not above using guns, will kill to protect given no other option, and lacing his smoke bombs with a watered down version of the scarecrows fear gas is genius, not only does he appear in front of his victims, he appears in front of them as their ""worst nightmares""!The others, Commissioner Garden is still Batman's biggest supporter but is facing retirement it is not really until he is gone that Batman man realises how much Garden protected him. Garden is the same tough but fair cop he always was. The Joker is just as evil as ever he comes out of his coma with the return of Batman and makes one last mass murdering run at Gotham. Unlike in the movie the Joker is not a physical match for Batman, but is a master of psychologically pushing his buttons. He knows this is his last chance if you will and he wants to die at the hands of Batman. Superman has become a tool of the establishment. Batman says it is because of Clarks respect for people in authority, but he also says to Clark nobody could force Clark to do something he did not want to do. Strangely Oliver and Clark share the same opinion on Batman he is too loud, he plays things mysterious but a loud kind of mysterious. Clark in his thought also says Batman need to work more in secret like he is force to do. This could be why he does not let anyone see him when he comes to Gotham. Maybe he should do something about his costume if he is trying to keep a low profile. The only thing I do not like it the relationship between Bruce and Alfred. Alfred is still the dutiful servant, but that is what Bruce seem to treat him like in this story a servant, someone to tell what to do and expect it to be done nothing more nothing less. Having said that Alfred does manage to get in some verbal barbs of his own, and though Bruce values his opinion probably more than anyone else's but there is a clear line saying Bruce/Batman is in charge live with it.I great comic , very detailed excellent as a standalone or as a companion to the movies to fill in extra details. A true classic for Batman fans. Enjoy reading it repeatedly over multiple sittings it is a lot to take in. All good!!!",100,2
59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Heather,352,13,2,"July 14, 2008","I know I'm alone in this, but I didn't really like The Dark Knight Returns. I struggled with the story structure -- all the perspective switching left me frequently scratching my head to figure out who was speaking, where we were, and what the Heck was happening. I was confused by some characters (the guy with the freaky flying baby bombs?). I was bothered that there was no discussion of Ellen/Robin's family -- we have VERY little information on her or why she wants to join Bats, how she really proves that she's worthy, etc. She shows up in costume one day and he decides she's good enough? Hrmph. I don't buy it.Eh. I just found myself laboring through it rather than enjoying it. In contrast, I loved The Long Halloween. I look forward to reading Dark Knight Year One to see if I like that any better.",74,14
59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Missy,316,15,5,"June 19, 2007","When I was growing up, comic books (this was years before 'graphic novels') were frowned upon in my household, but I was addicted to them anyway. X-Men, to be precise, because, OMG, Jean Grey was smart and tough (at least until Dark Phoenix) AND had both Scott Summers and Wolverine in love with her. (I do love a good soap.) Batman was a joke back then, thanks to that moronic TV show. But Batman, the real Dark Knight, wasn't a joke--if Superman is who America yearns to be; Batman is who we're afraid we are.In 1986, Frank Miller (Sin City) blew all of the camp out of the water and reclaimed a bit of popular culture by writing a stunning Batman and, not so incidentally, a picture-perfect example of why graphic novels aren't for kids. The artwork is fabulous, the characters are crisp and complex. It's not just the original Dark Knight, it's who that character evolved into. Dark, twisted, bitter, but still fighting to make things better. The movie Batman Begins never would have been made without this Dark Knight. Your library probably has a copy of this; check it out.",62,5
59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Tim,467,578,2,"April 27, 2020","It's one of the definitive Batman stories! It's brilliant! It helped comics become more serious! I hate it!Hello everyone, welcome to another edition of Tim has an unpopular opinion.Okay, so that last one is an exaggeration, I do not hate the Dark Knight Returns, but I do not like it, and I certainly do not love it like so many do.Let's get this started with the direction most people seem to go with, I do not like Frank Miller. There has been plenty said about how Miller has become a self-parody of his work and how Sin City ruined his writing and that it's hard to enjoy his older work because of this. I'm not going that direction, though I honestly see where that group comes from.I disliked this book before I disliked Miller. I'll also say something that most people who dislike Miller won't say; I genuinely enjoy some of his Sin City work (not all of them, but I've read them all and actually do think there are some gems). I dislike this book for four main reasons:1. The art. I hate, genuinely hate, the art style. The story could be amazing, but it would be hard to get over a three star review simply for the art. It's ugly to look at. It's blocky, it's cramped because of the small panels and it's unimpressive all around. I know this is very much on opinionated thing, but this style worked better in Miller's later black and white style because the panels were frequently larger and less detail actually made the issues less obvious. It's unpleasant on the eyes and it legitimately gave me a headache.2. TV talking heads. Oh yes, I know he gets worse with this later, but it was annoying attempt at political comedy here and adds very little to the actual story. 3. I dislike Superman as a character, always have and most likely always will, but even I will say that Miller is just ridiculous with his portrayal of him. Superman is guided by a moral compass, he should not be portrayed as an ineffectual tool for the government. He may be ""all American,"" but his loyalty to the government (as shown many times) would not stretch to the lengths Miller goes to. He's a joke here, just to show how ""awesome"" Batman is in comparison. 4. Swastika pastie woman. Jesus Christ Frank, I don't even have words, but maybe the Joker does... (Made even funnier by the fact that she is supposed to work with the Joker... obviously other comic creators disagree with Miller’s take.)Now, I won't disregard the merit of this book in terms of the history of comics. It did help get comics to be taken more seriously, it did help people think of Batman as the Dark Knight rather than Adam West and it did help usher in more interesting stories involving Superheroes. I also admit that I genuinely liked Carrie Kelley's story line about becoming Robin. I like nothing else... okay, that's a lie. I love that one of the Mutant members says ""It's just a Goddamned bat."" Because well,  Thanks Miller, you added to your meme retroactively. 2/5 stars.",59,5

This is a totally different spin on Batman first published in 1986 by Frank Miller. Don't expect it to be like the old cartoons. Definitely not like the Adam West Batman from the 60s. Not the Justice League of America. Batman and Superman are hardly on speaking terms. The governments have passed laws against vigilante super heroes so most of them are in prison or banished, or, like Superman, secretly working for the government. Batman, after a series of traumatic incidents, has not been seen in the last ten years. The Joker and Two Face are both in psycho wards. A series of incidents force Batman to come back out to the shock of the world. Gotham is turned on its head and the public isn't sure what to make of him; especially the younger people who thought he was just a legend. img src=
  
/>In this Batman faces off with two-face, the joker and a mutant gang which has practically overrun the streets. Look for a face off against Superman, an intro. from the new Robin and a setup for the next book in the series, where Batman decides to free some of the super heroes in prison. 
  
Artwork is very gritty. Lots of focus on Batman's age in his late fifties, as well as his lack of forbearance in not realizing his age makes him less agile and strong. So, he gets into several jams. Heh.  Oh, and a few times, Batman actually uses guns but it's for good reasons. Enjoy. A sequel written and illustrated by Miller, The Dark Knight Strikes Again, was published in 2001. Miller said that the comic series' plot was inspired by Dirty Harry, specifically the 1983 film Sudden Impact, in which Dirty Harry returns to crime-fighting after a lengthy convalescence. Miller also said his own increasing age was a factor in the plot. (Wiki) IGN Comics ranked The Dark Knight Returns second on a list of the 25 greatest Batman graphic novels, behind Batman: Year One,  and called The Dark Knight Returns, ""a true masterpiece of storytelling"" with ""[s]cene after unforgettable scene."" In 2005, Time chose the collected edition as one of the 10 best English language graphic novels ever written. Forbidden Planet placed the collected issue at number one on its ""50 Best of the Best Graphic Novels"" list. Writer Matthew K. Manning in the ""1980s"" chapter of DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle (2010) called the series ""arguably the best Batman story of all time.""

Now, two decades later, I've revisited it.The Dark Knight Returns is still a powerful book. Bruce Wayne crawls out of a bottle, shaves off his mustache, and puts on the cowl to fight crime once again, heading toward inevitable showdowns with Joker and Superman once he restores order to the streets of Gotham.The art shows the evolution of Frank Miller's style from his Daredevil days, bridging the gap between that style and the style he'd be known for on Sin City years later. The writing is why the book was influential at the time, though, and is still influential decades later. This is the birth of the chronically pissed off, over-planning Batman of today. It also paved the way for Batman: Year One, the Tim Burton Batman movie, and even Batman Beyond to some degree. Broken down Batman in this volume isn't that far removed from broken down Batman in Batman Beyond.I'm a sucker for tales of the aging hero trying to fix things while he still can and that's pretty much what this story is. However, this book has not aged nearly as well as Watchmen or even Miller's own Batman: Year One. It screams 1980s on almost every page. I also forgot how damn wordy it is.For good or for bad, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns is an influential Batman book and an important piece of Batman lore.

59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Sarah,170,98,5,"December 7, 2020","This is EXACTLY the kind of Batman story I was looking for. Delightfully dark, which is when the Dark Knight is at his absolute best. Batman comes out of retirement after 10 years and returns to save the streets of Gotham once more. It focuses on how he doesn’t seem to realise, that at 55 years old, his age will limit him. Alongside him is a rather fantastic female Robin, easily one of my favourite incarnations of the character.The Joker doesn’t feature too heavily compared to some of my other favourite DC comics, but he is so great (and so camp!) in this when he appears. It brings the more gritty and ruthless side to the character back, which had been lacking during some of the ‘70s and ‘80s. The artwork really suits this style of story, it’s not clean cut and is very rough around the edges. It shows that when evil arises, a hero also must to balance everything. Gotham is very rife with crime when Batman returns. ",44,6

Sorry : (My first superhero graphic novel review. It’s like diving right into shark infested waters. Please be gentle and keep in mind that I hold zero belief that anyone should ever take my reviews seriously. Period. But even more so when it comes to this one.As I said, this is my first foray into the unchartered waters of the world of Batman other than through television and film. I chose Batman: The Dark Knight Returns for two reasons – I’m a Frank Miller fan and . . . 
  

  
Yep. I’ve run the gamut with the a lot of you through this Batman . . . 
  
and this one . . . 
  
and . . . 
  
NO!but this one . . . 
  
and even this one . . . 
  
Many claim all of the above were made possible because of this story. I’m obviously not an expert, so I have no clue if that’s true, but I’m going with it because that makes my first Batman selection so much cooler.So why the “meh” rating? Wellllll, there are a few reasons. First, Batman’s voice. I realize Batman has been out of commission for quite some time at the onset of this story and he has to work out the kinks while battling evil, but did his voice have to sound so much like this guy????
  
Miller left me having a chicken and egg moment for quite some time with that one. Second, the artwork. Although sometimes Frank Miller’s simplistic artsy-fartsy style that I enjoy really showed on the page . . . 
  
and occasionally there were striking full-page images that kind of knocked my socks off . . . 
  
(Also, ‘Murica)Unfortunately, there was also an abundance of pages with half-assed “television screens” taking place of actual art.Speaking of those t.v. screens, that brings me to my final issue - the muddy storyline. Batman takes a back-up role to all of the ranty news reports discussing various political stances. (Sidenote to address those rants: This story was written nearly 30 years ago and the social injustices discussed in the storyline are the same ones happening today. FFS – get your shit together, America!) It got to be sooooo repetitive – almost like entire pages were copied/pasted. Between the news reports, Batman moaning about his aches and pains, and the bad guy mutants reminding me how they were going to “raze Gotham” and “rape the women” and “bathe in Gotham’s blood” every third page I found my attention wandering more than a time or two.All that being said, there were some good points. The obvious being my familiarity with the basic story and Frank Miller. But also? The cameos. They were a fun little Easter egg hunt. Everyone from Letterman . . . .
  
to Ronald Reagan and Chris Christie (?) and . . . Hank Hill (?????) . . . 
  
to Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves . . . 
  
I keeed, I keeeed.Leaving my final experience with Batman: The Dark Knight Returns as definitely not one of the worst things I’ve ever subjected myself to.Oh, and in case you’re wondering how a super professional comic book aficionado like myself prepares for a review like this, here’s a glimpse of my little world ; )First, make sure you show you can prove you are a legit nerd by gathering your various Batman Pop Vinyls together . . . . 
  
Then take one of your besties shopping for some Batman gear . . . 
  
 (Dear Hot Topic, you can start sending me free crap whenever you feel like it in exchange for all these endorsements.)Third, enlist the help of your resident Dark Knight to assist you in making sure you are providing well-thought out opinions . . . 
  
And finally, humiliate the other butthole who lives in your house and refuses to let you read anything containing colored or slick pages because he insists on laying on them all the time by making him wear a BCatman costume . . . 
  
See what happens when you act an ass, Django? I share your punishment with all of the interwebs.One final note: What’s up with the nipples on those mutants???
  
Do they sit around breastfeeding each other all day when they aren’t raping women and bathing in their blood???",42,24
59960,Batman The Dark Knight Returns,Ethan,203,220,5,"December 26, 2020","In Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, a fifty-five-year-old Bruce Wayne comes out of a ten year retirement, amid a historic crime wave caused by the youth gang known as the Mutants, to take up the mantle of Batman again and rid the city of Gotham of their menace. We encounter old foes in this story in Two-Face and Joker, but there are some fresh faces as well.One such character I found to be a very welcome addition to the Batman universe was Carrie Kelley, the new Robin. Not only is she a welcome change from the endless series of young boys Batman usually uses for Robins in that she is a girl, she is also a better Robin than previous iterations, in my opinion, because in this book she was able to be useful to Batman.Prior to this book, Robin has been a somewhat pointless character in the Batman universe, at least in the Batman books I've read so far. Batman usually just tells him to stay in the car while he does the real work, or he gives him some menial task to keep him away from the main action taking place, or etc. I've actually wondered a lot more than once why he even has a Robin to begin with. It seems like maybe he wants someone to take over his mantle some day, but then he never trusts him with anything, making him ill-equipped to ever take over for him and effectively sabotaging his own plan in a self-defeating way.But in this book, Carrie Kelley's Robin seems to always be right in the heart of the action; she flies attack helicopters, squares off with villains like Abner, and even drives the Batmobile, which in this book has basically become a tank on steroids. I think in his old age Batman has realized that he isn't capable of doing everything alone anymore, like he could as a younger man, and so he relies on Robin a lot more in this book than in previous installments. This change of heart makes for a much more purposeful Robin, which I was thrilled to see.The story itself is also quite fascinating, exploring a lot of themes relevant to today's society. Things like the gullibility of people and their susceptibility to blindly following cult leaders (insert Trump emoji here), the rehabilitation of criminals and the mentally ill, as well as how the same are treated by society, the ethics of vigilantes, hero worship, and more are explored, but not in a way that bores or preaches to the reader.Another question, though admittedly one that's been covered in many previous Batman stories, that I thought was masterfully explored in this book, is the question of whether Batman creates his enemies. Do villains like Joker, Two-Face, and so on exist only because there is a Batman? Or does Batman exist because they do, in order to stop them? It's the ultimate ""chicken or the egg"" question in comics. In this volume, Miller appears to create a powerful argument that Batman's enemies exist only because he does. In the story, Joker is in a mental hospital, and has been for years, and he appears to be content with his fate. It's only when he realizes Batman has returned from retirement that a long-dormant, evil grin of joy spreads across his face and he begins plotting a scheme to once again wreak havoc on Gotham.In conclusion, I've read a decent amount of Batman books over the past few years, most of them considered classics, but am by no means anything close to an expert. It could be that there are far superior Batman books and stories out there. But in terms of the ones I've read so far, I think this one is probably the best. It was a pleasure to read, despite being very bleak in tone, and it has a spectacular ending that opens up exciting new possibilities for later installments in the franchise.Highly recommended!",40,N/A

Much of the story was told through the media and news, which is a boring device when used this much. There was some great art, but so much of it was tiny and we did not get landscapes. I also thought the story thread was choppy and things were slopped together. What was Superman doing in this. Dots are not connected and some things don't make sense. Batman is also old here. Robin is around, but not the Robin we know, but a girl. Batman is like an old grizzled grumpy man, which I liked that choice, it's unusual, but it got old toward the end. I had this on my list to read because it's a classic and people love it. I love a darker Batman, he is supposed to be dark, in my opinion, but I thought this story was sloppy, messy and it was not enjoyable to read at all. There were new things here, but I just didn't care. I see I'm in the minority, but I did not like this. It is not for me, simple as that. I'm glad others appreciate this, but I can't join in on that opinion. ",39,12
