22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Jeff ,912,674,2,"November 2, 2017","The Caped Crusader with footnotes!?!or Art for Art’s Sake.or Holy Histrionics, Batman, I’d rather have listened to an opera…Grant Morrison gets “serious” – it’s even mentioned in the title twice in case you need a reminder – and if Carrot Top wants to star in a remake of Death of a Salesman or Billy Joel wants to write a concerto for flugelhorn and triangle, I don’t want to hear about it.Wait, Jeff, did you say footnotes?Yes, Goodreader, this is why I love you, because nothing ever gets by you. Nothing.This is the 25th anniversary edition of the publishing of this pretentious pile of crap, so we get Morrison’s script tacked onto the actual comic. The script includes footnotes because Mr. Morrison wants to share each and every pop culture allusion and Easter egg that he’s cleverly included for us.The script actually came in handy, because I could actually read what The Joker was trying to say, but shuffling back and forth between the comic and an addendum quickly wore thin.A plot summary: The inmates at Arkham take control of the asylum because it’s Tuesday and demand that Batman pay them a visit, because they love him so so much and want to cuddle and spoon and eat Toll House cookie dough real fast, which is a good thing because this isn’t take-control-of-the-situation-with-a-few-well-placed-bat-flash-gernades-and-a-couple-of-kidney-punches-and-or-batarang-or-two-to-the-dome Batman, this is Emo-boy-Mr.-Feels-Kyle-Raynor-is-my-psychic-twin Batman, so let’s brood, shall we?Therapy seems to work wonders for a few of the rogues – yes, Two-Face flip a coin pick a card to see if you can scratch your ass.The rest:Mad Hatter:Stop spouting drivel and take a tranquilizer!Clayface:He’s seen better days. Idea: Bats, shove him into a kiln and present him to Alfred as a big ashtray or something. You can put him between the dinosaur and the big penny.Did I mention that the asylum is haunted because the Arkham’s were a bunch of loons or the Arkham’s were a bunch of loons  because  the original house was haunted?No? Sorry. Bottom line: The art is purty, but then so was Where’s Waldo? And with Where’s Waldo you didn’t have to work as hard to find the player(s).Another word association? Ready?This book…………………….Crap.",89,40
22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Eric,852,72,1,"May 30, 2012","What a fucking mess. The painted artwork was appalling, the story-line was incoherent, the dialogue was barely legible, and, most importantly, the portrayal of Batman was all wrong. This felt like a second-rate haunted-house horror that Batman was wedged into, and poorly at that. Batman's encounters with various villains felt thrown-in, in a cheap name-dropping way, his decision-making was baffling to non-existent, and the story's resolution -- hanging on a coin-flip -- was absurd. The back-story to Gotham's Arkham Asylum was done much better in the Batman: Arkham Asylum video-game. If I'd read this first, I may never have played that game due to fear it was this bad. I only did decide to read this after seeing it on multiple best graphic-novel lists. How can so many lists be so wrong? And how is the Goodreads rating so high? What am I missing?",62,16
22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Tim,467,578,5,"December 4, 2020","Upon occasion I have been asked what my favorite Batman story is. I ask immediately afterwards if they mean favorite story involving Batman or favorite story about Batman. The answers are different. Favorite story involving Batman is The Killing Joke, but that is Joker's story not his. My favorite about Batman is Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth.So much has been written about this comic that honestly at this point reviewing it accomplishes nothing. For the most part people know what it is about and they already know if they love it or hate it (there seems to be no in-between). Rather than reviewing it in a traditional way, let me just break down five things that I love about it.1. The art. Dear sweet Dave McKean the art!  It's beautiful. It's chaotic. It's symbolic. It's hard to follow. It's the perfect way to describe the book as a whole and I love it!2. A completely psychological take on Batman. Here the villains are less people than ideas, horrible ideas and doubts in Batman's head. Those looking for Batman punching a villain in the face should look elsewhere. There are a few fights in it, but they are not the point and indeed often come off anti-climactic. It is the dialogue and the thought process one is supposed to go through which are the real battles here.3. The backstory of Arkham Asylum. That is a horror tale in and of itself, and it contrasts with Batman's struggle so beautifully. 4. Grant Morrison's writing. From the dialogue to the symbolism of the characters, it's a joy to read. If you have a hard time figuring out how everything in it works (as most do including the writer it seems) check out the script included in most newer editions of the book. It's a fascinating read with Morrison's own notes. 5. A fully mature Batman story. Oh, I know that's been done plenty of times, but this one is essentially an R rated horror story in Batman form. It was one of the first to do that and it is still one of the best. Will my review win people over? Probably not. As I said, the reputation of this book is so well known that you likely already have a few strong opinions on it. That said, if you've never heard of this book, or are considering it, I highly recommended it for anyone looking for a dark and psychological horror story involving superheroes and self doubt. For my money, it's never been done better... just don't go in expecting Batman to be his usual self. This is a very different sort of tale. 5/5 stars.",55,N/A

This is not your traditional Batman tale. Some people won't like it. In fact, Batman seems like a normal man when confronted by the horrors within and acts in very non Batman ways. There's a two part story here where we switch back and forth to the founder of Arkham and why he turned his mansion into a facility for the mad and Batman trying to navigate his way through the madness of Arkham. 
  
Batman action is minimal. This is much more of an emotional journey. There is distinctive lettering for different characters and massive amounts of symbolism so several things will be missed by the casual reader. Think of this as a true nightmare tale for Batman. Sometimes the symbolism is a bit much and gets in the way of the tale. This graphic novel influenced a video game of a similar title but that one is more action based. It also influenced Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker.

22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,2,"February 21, 2014","Based solely upon his 2006-2013 run, Grant Morrison might be the greatest Batman writer of all time. But he wasn’t always so brilliant as his first Batman book, the mega-selling Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, shows. The inmates have overrun the asylum and are holding civilians hostage. With Joker running free with a knife, Batman goes into the asylum to stop him and enters a nightmarish netherworld. Meanwhile, the troubled life of the asylum’s founder, Amadeus Arkham, is explored. The story is one long rambling mess, which is part of Morrison’s intent. It’s designed to be dream-like and to read like a song and therefore, as a comic, it’s difficult to follow or really understand. I get the impression the symbolism of the tarot is important but the book didn’t make me interested enough to want to pursue a deeper understanding of it. Batman’s characterisation is a bit off too – how was he beaten by a deranged doctor!? Some readers might scoff that Morrison’s comics are always like this with his drug use, but he actually wrote this before he began using drugs and alcohol – he writes in his afterword that he stayed up for hours on end to achieve the altered state of consciousness he wanted before sitting down to write. So it’s official: with or without drugs, Morrison writes weird comics! Hear that, poseur artists, you don’t need vice to produce art! Dave McKean’s artwork matches Morrison’s bizarre story well but it still looks a bit too avant-garde for a comic. McKean’s best known for being The Sandman’s cover artist and his art is well suited to that format. But for page after page of interior art? It’s just headache-inducing! And when he does draw distinguishable figures, they look like poor Simon Bisley facsimiles. I liked Morrison’s idea to have the Arkham doctors try weaning Harvey Dent off of the two-sided coin and onto the I Ching. It seemed like an original and viable means of treatment for Two-Face. But other ideas like the Joker calling the outside world the asylum and the world inside Arkham the real world was just corny, and the Amadeus Arkham storyline just read like a poor man’s Psycho. Morrison’s comics usually have more substance to them but Arkham Asylum is all surface texture with few great ideas. Arkham Asylum is a visually interesting book but it looks and reads like an art student’s project, ie. a pretentious mish-mash of nonsense, than a good comic. I definitely wouldn’t rank it among Batman’s classics! If you want to read Morrison’s best Batman books, start with Batman and Son and go forwards from there. ",42,3

22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,4,"January 31, 2023","An overkill of antagonists  Led by the jokerWho is, once again, showing Batman what one man with enough madness can achieve. Besides some fun with Two Face, Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, Clayface, Scarecrow, Doctor Destiny, etc., the biggest concept of this disturbing work is to let the reader Live the life of an inmate of a mental asylumThat´s what makes it unique, because although other Batman graphic novels like The Killing Joke https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9... have some implications about how society treats mentally sick people and the criminally insane, this one is different. By letting Batman suffer under the same inhumane circumstances, it let´s one ask How anyone should get healthy again under such conditionsSadly many mental illnesses are so severe that there is no real hope and especially no reason to endanger citizens by again unleashing seemingly healed maniacs. It´s not as if it often just took weeks or months until a resocialized, pardoned criminal went on another killing, raping, or pyromania spree. What this says about the psychiatrists and psychiatry itself is another elephant in the room manifested in  Amadeus Arkhams´diaryThis shows that nobody is as normal and mentally stable as it seems, also and especially people permanently working with dangerous Loki style murderers. So both the big mental asylum pharmacological industrial complex and psychology/psychiatry itself get their roast combined with a  Graphic style that may be a bit too unusual And thereby simply not what some readers expect and like. Quite an irony that one of the works´ biggest strengths is also its only real weakness. I guess it would have been much more successful with stereotypical violent, bloody, and disturbing graphic novel drawings because, honestly, the creep factor is possibly simply a bit too big that way too. The shattered minds in combination with these unusual, more paintings than drawings, that often seem to fray and dissolve like the souls of crazy criminals, may be too sicko mode for some readers. Although I´m seriously playing with the idea of rereading it under the influence of some beers or other stuff to enjoy it even more.

22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Louie the Mustache Matos,880,59,2,"November 16, 2022","I love comic books, and I’ve grown quite fond of Trade Paperbacks. They give you a full story that might span several comic book issues without you having to pick them up monthly. Batman is one of my favorite heroes. Arkham Asylum is where Batman's Rogues Gallery are incarcerated, and so I had high expectations. High concept. Thoughtful narrative, but a little pretentious. The painted artwork I guess is designed to be nightmarish ala Bill Sienkiewicz' Moon Knight to highlight how the inmates visually observe their surroundings through the subjective prism deemed insanity. However, the sequential art makes the narrative difficult to follow, and I was unimpressed and unconvinced. This story was not great, but it wasn't horrible. You could avoid this one. To my mind, Grant Morrison has never been the type of writer that makes a reader stop to take notice, and this graphic novel does nothing to alter that perception.",33,N/A
22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Marc,14,3,5,"October 15, 2007","Arkham Asylum is the best graphic novel I've ever read for two reasons: writing, and art.This isn't your average WHACK! POW! comic book. In fact, there is almost no violence or glammed-out secret weapons. Grant Morrision takes us through a masterful exploration into the psyche of Bruce Wayne, a man who suffered a tragic loss at an early age and formed a very clear alternate identity. Is he a crime fighter, or does he suffer from MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder), and does it even matter.Set in the halls of Arkham Aslyum, home to ""inmates"" like the Joker and the original MPD superstar, Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent, this tale is creepy as you begin to realize that this particular fight will not be done with fists and bat belts.The only thing that tops the writing is the art. Dave McKean uses traditional and digital media to create a world that feels as crazy as it's written to be. The echos in Batman's head are shown in a fashion that you can almost taste and smell. I found myself saying, ""yes, that's what that thought or feeling must LOOK like.""No other graphic novel has ever matched art and writing so perfectly. If you read one graphic novel in your life, and if you want to see that even the most pop-star of comic heroes can be gritty and real, read this book.",32,2
22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Brett C,768,157,5,"May 2, 2021","""Until the night of 1901, when I first caught a glimpse of that other world. The world of the dark side.""From these lines on the first page, I knew this was going to be a dark ride. The artwork from the inside front-cover to the inside back-cover helped maintain continuity of oppressive psychological heaviness. It was fun to read and look at the unique artwork because of the various references and symbolisms. I enjoyed this one from start to finish. The inmates of the infamous Arkham Asylum have rioted and taken over. The Joker and the other criminals demand Batman make a personal appearance inside the asylum. He is forced to enter the asylum where he undergoes his own dark psychological journey while dealing with a few villains. While Batman briefly encounters Two-Face, Mad Hatter, Killer Croc, Scarecrow, and others, the plot tells the backstory of the asylum's dark beginning.The parallel story within the plot is about Dr. Amadeus Arkham, the psychiatrist who founded the asylum. This story is told from journal excerpts discovered hidden in the hospital. They are the handwritten entries detailing his painful childhood, the difficulties of his profession in his adult life, and the tragic misfortune of his family. Unfortunately, these traumatic experiences shape him a dark way.This was a dark and very psychological story. The artwork did a great job at highlighting the storyline and was a major part of the overall concept. I would definitely recommend this to any Batman fan and Joker fan. Thanks!",23,N/A
22374,Batman Arkham Asylum  A Serious House on Serious Earth,Julian,37,13,5,"May 8, 2012","A batman tale at its best, as it reaches unflinchingly deep into the recesses of the human psyche. While the comic may be accused by some as symptomatic of an attempt at at best, pop psychology, I think the authors have done a marvellous job in portraying the differences by which Batman and The Joker are negotiating what are in essence, very similar psychological conflicts.This is done on a backdrop literally seething with a brooding, menacing perceived threat of total disintegration, which was in fact embraced by another main character, that of Arkham himself. An analytically minded reader will appreciate how each of Batman's villains in fact, symbolically represent in avatar form each of his specifc fears. These fears make him human; while also confirming that his mask etc in fact serve as a defensive character armour which keeps the underlying guilt, abandonment rage and fantasies of revenge both at bay. At the same time, the mask also allows for sublimation in his role as a 'dark knight'. There are nice references to Freudian theories (a connecting theme here is the loss of mother-via murder and imagined/actual matricide- and its associated trauma, annihilation anxiety and subsequent efforts at psychological defence), his structural theory of the mind (illustrated concretely by the architecture of the Asylum itself) Jungian archetypes, an implicit idealizing identification exhibited by Dr Cavendish (enabled by the Asylum again functioning as a container of chaos AND an evocative object), and even the role of 'similarity; in magic as described by James George Frazier in 'The Golden Bough'. This is the way fairy tales should be told (well, especially for adults)! Super-heroes are no longer just an all pervasive, concretely 'good' force dressed in a pretty costume,partaking in a sterile and entirely logical world whereby 'evil' villains are routinely 'defeated'. No, this is a more realistic (albeit gruesome at times) confrontation of life and its culturally suppressed opposites (or should I say, inseparable shadow): death, chaos and disintegration.",21,N/A

Let's face it, the guy was a nut, he might as well have been singing ""Hello Dolly!""good god, morrison. ""Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord"" makes a helluva lot more sense in a book centered around the themes of death and rebirth than ""O say can you see...""and then he just writes it off because ""the guy was a nut"" even though the other major theme of the book is that insanity is sanity and vise versa.ugh.mckean did a wonderful job with the art, though. a lot of it isn't really my style, but still admirable. i love how the joker's hair and nails have a mind of their own.",17,N/A
