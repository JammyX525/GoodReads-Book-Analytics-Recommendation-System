REP: characters of colour, f/f relationship, mental health (hints at depression), grief. trigger warnings: storms, loss of a loved one, drowning, hurt animals, depression. This is such a stunning and important story all about how our actions are affecting our oceans and reefs. Katie O'Neill also has such a stunning art style with gorgeous colours and loveable characters!

    “But there’s no home without a future…”
  
I just want to say that Katie O'Neill has the most breathtaking, most gorgeous, and most adorable illustrations out there right now. Each page is literally a brand-new work of art. Never have I ever loved the illustrations in anything as much as I do in this and in The Tea Dragon Society!Aquicorn Cove stars a young girl named Lana, and she and her father come to visit her Auntie Mae on her little island. Lana is grieving the loss of her mother, but feels happier in her hometown, before Lana was forced to move to the city with her father. And the village is rebuilding after a disaster has struck. But Lana is more than happy to help. But when she goes to the water, she finds a little seahorse-like friend, who is in need of her help! We also get to see Auntie Mae’s journey below the water, where the Aquicorns live! And Aunt Mae and their leader, Aure, strike up the most heart-warming f/f relationship. But we also get to see firsthand how important it is to keep our waters clean and that we need to respect coral reefs and underwater ecosystems.Every book I’ve read by Katie has also has such an important and powerful message. Aquicorn Cove is about conservation and how the actions we take on land are impacting our waters. How overfishing, climate change, and polluting is hurting these water sources, and if we don’t change our actions then the results are going to be more and more severe. This is a book that really focuses on the delicate balance we have with all living things, and how we have to respect and protect each other to keep the cycle going. We all have to be responsible for our carbon footprint, or nothing will be safe; land or sea.

Overall, I loved this more than words. Some of these panels were able to evoke such an emotional response from me. I shed so many tears, but also grinned so many smiles. I truly think Katie O’Neill is doing so much good in the world, and I wish I could put her work in everyone’s hands. Beautiful and breathtaking illustrations, empowering and important messages, and characters that I wish I had growing up. I hope you all pick this up and fall in love, too!

36482829,Aquicorn Cove,Whitney Atkinson,903,13700,4,"July 18, 2018","Thanks to Netgalley for providing an e-arc in exchange for my honest review!This book was beyond precious!! It's like a Disney movie in a graphic novel because of its lighthearted, magical vibe yet undertones of sorrow and meaning. There's loss, there's reunion, there's messages about environmentalism, there's mythical creatures, and there's even a subtle f/f romance. The art was so gorgeous and this book was very easy to follow and a quick read that definitely got me teary-eyed. I can't wait to get a copy of this for my shelf!",55,1 comment

Not only does this book feature mind-bending gorgeous works of art, it holds so much meaning in its pages. Usually, books that evoke such truly beautiful pieces tend to not have an exciting storyline to tag along, but this is where Aquicorn Cove comes in to shake up the status quo.
When Lana and her father return to their seaside hometown to help clear the debris of a big storm, Lana remembers how much she’s missed the ocean—and the strong, reassuring presence of her aunt. As Lana explores the familiar beach, she discovers something incredible: a colony of Aquicorns, small magical seahorse-like creatures that live in the coral reef. Lana rescues an injured Aquicorn and cares for it with the help of her aunt, who may know more about these strange creatures than she's willing to admit. But when a second storm threatens to reach the town, choices made many years ago about how to coexist with the sea start to rise to the surface. Lana realizes she will need to find the strength to stand on her own, even when it means standing up to the people who she has always relied on to protect her.I was already keen on the premise alone, courtesy my unshakeable love for the ocean, but the fact that Aquicorn Cove also addressed the harms in fishing ocean creatures and the dangers of plastic had me practically cheering out loud. WHOO!!This is one of those reviews were words needn't be written because the art speaks for itself. I mean:This stilled my mind from all racing thoughts.The beauty and power of that first panel stopped me cold, for some reason.I zoomed through this short read without even trying because IT'S JUST THAT GOOD.One last thing: Aquicorn Cove knows how to evoke real emotions, make characters feel completely real, and seamlessly captures intricate details that had a calming effect on me.ARC kindly provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.Publication Date: October 16, 2018Note: I’m an Amazon Affiliate.

36482829,Aquicorn Cove,[S] Bibliophage,950,851,5,"March 14, 2019","I've read and enjoyed the two previously published graphic novels illustrated by 
  Katie O'Neill
 before. Hence, when I saw that she will be releasing a new book, I immediately seize the chance to check this out.The illustrations in her latest comic book are quite similar to The Tea Dragon Society which she released last year, but I prefer the story of Aquicorn Cove because of how it brings up the environment issue. It set as a wake-up call for readers about it and no matter how small, we could contribute to saving our habitat that will help all living things.This graphic novel is an amazing and a bit informative reading material with a great message and heartwarming story that will delight readers of all ages.",40,N/A

Her stories are so beautiful and so is her art, and the characters, and the world... all of it is perfect. There's a great story about environmentalism and doing our part in the world to keep things clean and not take more than we need, which was really sweet and heartfelt. I just loved the whole thing so much and I truly never get tired of Katie O'Neill's stories. <3 ",34,2

And that's making things difficult. It's not always the big things I guess that makes life meaningful.I love the author's work so much! Her graphic novels are always so heartfelt and dreamlike beautiful.All the feels. The girl is missing her mom. She's hurting. Her dad is hurting but trying his best to make a new start at a new place. But the little girl feels she belongs to her home by the sea. The story is about grief and magic. It's about acceptance and healing.So worth the read.",30,N/A
