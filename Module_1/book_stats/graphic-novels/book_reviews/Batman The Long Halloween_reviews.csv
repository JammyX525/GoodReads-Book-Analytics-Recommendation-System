106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Anne,"3,785",6900,3,"May 31, 2022","2.5 starsThe first thing you need to know is that The Long Halloween isn't actually a Halloween story. Sadly, if you're looking for that perfect spooky tale to curl up with during October, you'll need to keep on looking. It's a Young Batman vs the Mob story.Mmm. Ok, this is one of those Batman stories that everyone loves and I just sort of tolerate. I don't hate it or anything, I just can't really muster up any excitement for it. But I keep trying.This was my 3rd time and I thought maybe now that I'm more mature I'd appreciate this sort of crime story.Apparently not.I'm just not at all interested in mobsters. They just don't evoke any real feelings in me. Yeah, they're criminals, but...eh. Live and let live. They're like drug dealers in that they wouldn't have a job if someone wasn't asking them to do that job. Plus, they're organized. As someone who likes things kept tidy, I have an appreciation for anyone who manages to stay organized.I'm only sort of joking...The point I'm trying to make is that these aren't serial killers or child molesters. And they're only half as dirty as the people we elect into office. So. Whatever. It doesn't excite me when Batman goes after these guys.Ok, ok. There are a lot of his regular bad guys involved in this one. But because the main focus is on crime and corruption in the city, the supervillains seem...less cool. Like they're there as background props simply because this is set in Gotham. You know what I mean? It's expected that Poison Ivy shows up with her weird leaf hair and breathes her roofie breath on everyone. But even the Dark Knight's entire rogue gallery showing up couldn't really save me from being a bit bored by the plot. The gist is that there's a new killer in town. The Holiday Killer. <--because they kill on holidays.It's all very genius. I swear. <--I'm totally kidding.There's a bunch of suspects and it seems like everyone is in on it, but then...NO! It's that weird janitor that you saw mopping the floors back in issue one! <--stop crying, you whiner baby, that's not whodunnit.In other words, a lot of running around for very little reward. To me, this one reads like Hush but without the fun jazz hands or Jim Lee's art. And you know what's weird? I actually like Time Sale's stuff in other books! But for some reason, I really don't like to look at The Long Halloween. Catwoman, especially. Her outfit is fugly and stupid. I can forgive the idiotic tail...maybe. But when you couple it with those fucking needless whiskers you've completely trip-tropped right into Furry territory. Every time I look at her, it makes me want to reach for my tweezers and check my upper lip for stray hair. *shudder* The main thing that makes this one interesting (to me) is that it tells the story of how Harvey Dent became Two Face. But even that doesn't quite salvage it enough to make it actually interesting. <--just my opinion This is considered a classic Batman comic, so I'd suggest reading it and making up your own mind as to whether or not you love it.",144,88
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Donovan,687,57,5,"November 16, 2022","""I believe in Gotham City.""The Long Halloween deserves its hype. It's a classic Batman story and belongs among the greatest like Batman Year One, The Dark Knight Returns, and The Killing Joke. I have to say, this is probably Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's best work. Loeb's writing is incredible. It definitely draws from Frank Miller's Batman Year One with its sense of noir, crime drama, mystery, and the addition of light horror. But largely The Long Halloween is, as the cover blurb says, ""an epic tragedy."" Because we see Batman and Captain Jim Gordon fail, and most of all, District Attorney Harvey Dent descend into hell and madness. The story itself follows the serial killer Holiday and the tangled web of the Maroni and Falcone crime families. What's most fascinating and tragic is to watch Bats, Gordon, and Dent affected and irrevocably changed by Holiday and the destructive mafia war.Like Loeb's writing, Tim Sale's artwork here is the best I've ever seen. I really believe he draws Batman and his world better than anything else. Dark, angular, gritty, dramatic. Deep colors and brilliant use of light. Some of the rare artwork I'd love to have framed on my wall. There's also a fantastic visual contrast between Bruce Wayne and Batman. Bruce, although big and tall, is similar to Clark Kent. Amorphous and stoic, or emotionally haunted by his past as we see in one scene. Batman, however, is this gigantic looming figure with long sharp ears and sprawling cape, rippling muscles, growl and scowl. He's more monster than man, and it's brilliant to see. This is in my top 5 favorite Batman stories. It's also one of the subtlest, a sort of cousin to Batman Year One, with the addition of mystery and some horror. The story is riveting, the dialog is solid, and the artwork is incredible. If you're new to Batman or a longtime fan, you have to check this out.",138,21
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Jeff ,912,674,4,"October 28, 2013","If I met anyone that had never read a Batman book, this is probably the one I would recommend. This is the quintessential Batman story. The volume revolves around mobsters being murdered on each holiday and takes place early in Batman’s career. It’s a vehicle for Harvey Dent’s transition from Gotham City district attorney to Two-Face. Dent along with Captain Gordon and Bats (puts “Detective” back in DC comics) attempt to figure out who’s the killer.It features most of Batman’s rogue’s gallery (where the heck did Solomon Grundy come from?) before they went super-mega villain. In this respect, it shares the same vibe as Batman: The Animated Series - relatively simple stories sans other superheroes, aliens, Omega Sanctions, etc.",88,25

Me:For reals Bats? Are we going to go there? This book had some draggy parts that bored me, but it did have Poison Ivy, The Riddler, The Joker, Catwoman and The Scarecrow..so it had some good stuff...but what the hell was with Soloman Grundy? He had no place in the frigging book.  Plus the art made you look hot. Batman:

106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Dan Schwent,"2,861",10500,4,"March 9, 2019","Someone is killing off associates of Gotham City's crime lord, Carmine ""The Roman"" Falcone but only only holidays. Can Batman, Commissioner Gordon, and Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent stop Holiday before the entire Falcone crime family is dead?I first read Batman: The Long Halloween in that mythic time before I felt compelled to write reviews for everything I read. I didn't care for it at the time but when a copy fell into my lap last week, I decided to give it another go.Batman: The Long Halloween is a 13 issue murder mystery. Someone is knocking off criminals with a .22 pistol and Batman and the law are stumped. Who is Holiday, aka The Holiday Killer, and why is Catwoman nearby every time Batman tries to investigate The Roman? And what does Calendar Man have to do with it? And what's up Harvey Dent's ass? All of these questions and more are answered over the graphic novel's nearly 400 pages.I don't normally go for retellings of stories I already know but The Long Halloween fleshed out a chapter in Batman's early days, Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face. While Tim Sale's artwork isn't my favorite, its cartoony, moody, dark feel perfectly suited the story. I've never been a huge fan of Jeph Loeb but he did a great job here. The mystery was great and even solveable if you were paying close attention. I wasn't and was surprised by the reveal, even though I read the Long Halloween before back before the world moved on.The Christopher Nolan Batman movies borrow a lot from the Long Halloween. I once said Grant Morrison's Batman felt the most like movie Batman but I think I'm going to have to issue a retraction for that. The Batman in Long Halloween IS the Batman from the Christopher Nolan trilogy.I will say that some of the story felt like filler. The bit with Poison Ivy was a little unnecessary and the whole Sofia Falcone Gigante thread could have been cut. It felt like the book was slightly stretched to fill thirteen issues instead of twelve. Those are pretty much my only gripes with it. Batman felt more like a detective in this and less an uber-prepared scientist super soldier, as it should be.Batman: The Long Halloween is right up there with Batman: Year One in the upper echelon of Batman books. 4.5 out of 5 Batarangs.",54,N/A
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,4,"June 1, 2018","Comic books often deal with extremes; they deal with the extremely good and the extremely bad, highlighting the struggle between two opposites on the morality scale. One wishes to wreak havoc, hurt people and gain some form of gratification. The other wishes to save and restore order. The two are diametrically opposed, though sometimes in order to achieve the most ultimate form of good (or evil) one needs step into the opposite camp to reach their goals. The two are not so far apart as they may appear.Enter (and exit) Harvey DentOnce a stalwart protector of justice, Dent is now the merciless Two Face who executes without remorse trusting in the luck of a coin to decide the fate of his victims. He has become the exact opposite of who he once was, though in reality he is a bitter reflection of the world at large.Like Batman The Killing Joke this story shows us how easy it is to fall into chaos, madness and despair when you live in a city like Gotham. Batman’s detective work can only do so much in the face of such havoc. Heroes and Villains are separated by a very thin line. This is a non-stop detective drama that is pulp noir, dark and gritty: it is an excellent Batman comic.",45,N/A
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Kemper,"1,388",6647,4,"April 25, 2022","I read this for the first time back in 2008, which was 5 Batman movies ago by my count. While I enjoyed it a lot back then, I didn't remember much about it so it was a shock to go through it now and realize how many things in this would go on to be included in various Bat-films. It's an interesting idea with a serial killer taking out mob related figures on holidays over the course of the year, and it also functions as a solid whodunit that manages to work in a really good version of the Harvey Dent/Two-Face origin story. The structure allows for Batman to deal with a bunch of his villains over the course of the year which is fun. ",35,1 comment
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Richard,970,347,4,"January 21, 2022","In general, this might be the most quintessential Batman story ever. I wouldn't call it the best just yet, but definitely one of the most definitive. It captures a proper tone, rightfully grounding it as a crime epic and features almost all of the major bat-villains. It follows a tumultuous year early in Batman's career as a vigilante as he works with GCPD Captain James Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent to bring down the untouchable Carmine ""The Roman"" Falcone and his crime mob that rule the underworld of Gotham, all while contending with a mysterious serial killer that strikes on holidays. It was great seeing how this year takes a heavy personal toll on these three dedicated crime fighters and how it leads one of them down a darker path toward becoming one of the best Batman villains. Also, it's so impressive that Jeph Loeb is able to fit all of these characters into this story without it feeling TOO crowded. Some of the cameos felt a little silly but I always saw what Leob was attempting to do and I rolled with it. There were some things I didn't like though. I thought the art really detracted from the story and was downright ugly. And here's yet another example of a writer that doesn't understand the Riddler. There is a difference between jokes and riddles, and the Riddler is not a jokester. In the future, any writer attempting to depict the Riddler should take a look at what Scott Snyder did with the character in his New 52 run, or even what Tom King does in his recent shitty run. But story-wise, it truly is one of the best Batman tales and definitely kept me riveted. I would recommend it to anyone starting out with the character. Even Christopher Nolan used it as a major inspiration for his epic crime saga-inspired Dark Knight trilogy.",31,7
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Trish,"1,846",3363,4,"October 31, 2017","This is my very first Batman comic. Apparently it's not too bad a place to start. I must admit I'm not too much into the big superhero comics but instead prefer independent comics (mostly because of the constant re-boots of universes etc).The Long Halloween is actually less of a superhero comic and more of a detective story. We have a bunch of mobsters such as Mr. Falcone and his Familia and on each holiday, someone dies. Thus, Batman (together with Harvey Dent and Lieutenant James Gordon) must find out who the murderer is. In between we have a number of runnings-in with other well-known characters such as Catwoman (who looked weird, so muscular in the outfit but slim in dresses). And we get the origin story of Two-Face which was nice.The artwork is not too much to my liking. Bruce isn't handsome, Selina has atrocious hair, there is the afore-mentioned weirdness of Catwoman, ... but in some way the edges actually work in delivering the story.",31,N/A
106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Chad,"7,293",853,5,"January 21, 2022","Any time Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale team up, it's a good thing, usually it's a great thing. By this point, they've made a name for themselves for writing ""THE"" Year One story for a hero. In the case of Batman, they've written five of them now. This was the first maxiseries they took a stab at, after writing three fantastic Halloween Legends of the Dark Knight specials. (For those of you not up on your DC history, Legends of the Dark Knight was an anthology series in the 80's and 90's set in Batman's earliest days.)For this series, there's a killer on the loose, Holiday, who kills on holidays. No one knows who it is. At the same time, Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent, and Batman have teamed up to take down the crime families of Gotham. So thirteen issues, beginning and ending on Halloween (hence the name). Most of Batman's rogues make an appearance. Sale gives them all his unique, stylistic makeovers. They're amazing character designs. I can stare at Tim Sale's work for hours (Yes, I know it's not for everyone.) This is just one of those great Batman comics that can be passed along to anyone that wants to read a really good comic.",30,N/A

To add even more momentum to the novel Some mob wars are the third storylineWith all 3 plots perfectly combined, Loeb distills an immensely complex, fascinating, and in universe connected graphic novel that is outstanding in this regard. Serial killers, supervillains, organized crime, and the implications of their influence on politics and economics, also the Wayne family, combined, couldn´t be more mindblowing. The deeper one dives into the dark Batman universe, the more fascinating, interconnected, and deep it gets.

They also try to catch Holiday, he might be killing bad people but that is not the right way to serve justice.What i didn't know but find out in this deluxe edition ( to my wife: thank you baby, best Christmas gift ever )is that the story takes place a bit later after the events of Batman: Year one, so it's still early days for the caped crusader.The plot is very interesting, a true detective story.

106069,Batman The Long Halloween,Erin *Proud Book Hoarder*,"2,376",1050,5,"October 11, 2015","I’d been hearing great things about this the past few years (I’m a late comer to the game, what can I say?) The story is broken up by different holidays, some major and some I basically forget exist until they pop up during the year. All the stories connect as Batman works with Gordon and attorney Dent to try and figure out who the killer is, as he strikes during the holiday season, setting forth a solid detective battle. They investigate, contemplate, interrogate, make wrong guesses, get shown right ones, and – even better – the reader leaves the series knowing something Batman doesn’t. Not something that happens often. Usually the ‘great detective’ doesn’t get led astray.The writing is simple and direct, the story working because it shows the background political machinations of Gotham’s crime bosses and their twisted families who go from suspecting each other, fighting each other, to aiding each other. Throw in Batman’s well known villains like The Riddler with his side story that ties into the main one, Joker of course in his crafty goals to ruin holidays for the innocent, Poison Ivy using her seductive charms to reel in victims, and catwoman hopping around never revealing all the cards in her deck. We even get an appearance from Solomon Grundy, who I always had a draw toward since seeing him in animated series.Truth told, Joker’s story was one of the least impressive and is gotten out of the way early on. Poison Ivy had a starring role at times and ended up surprised me. The Riddler showed himself as a strong villain like always, but as a flawed one too. The story works to show the evolution of Dent as a main character from hero to wacked villain.The artwork is pulpy and fresh, fitting into the story well. Batman is menacing and a force to be reckoned with. Some of the deaths were surprising, many of them startlingly violent for this type of comic collection. Some of the holiday stories worked better than others, as I mentioned with Joker being weaker, and Mother's Day was particularly brutal - the grimmest of the group on a depressing level with Bruce and his mother memories.I’m noob level with comics and their stories, so my opinions shouldn’t weigh as much for this stuff as some of my fellow reviewers who have read more of these and know the faithfulness of the character’s stories, but as an outsider looking in I have to say this was a fun read and impressive. It lived up to the hype in my eyes and will be something I’ll re-read in the coming years. ",26,4
