106076,Batman Dark Victory,Dan Schwent,"2,861",10500,4,"March 16, 2019","A year after Holiday was brought to justice, a new killer haunts the nights of Gotham City. The Hangman is killing cops, cops that seem to be linked to Harvey Dent in some way. Is Harvey Dent The Hangman?On the heels of Batman: The Long Halloween, I just had to read this. Fortunately, I snagged it on the same trade-in deal when I acquired The Long Halloween.Dark Victory and The Long Halloween share a similar structure. The Hangman only strikes on holidays. Each issue is centered around a different murder. Batman and James Gordon race to catch the Hangman before their heads wind up in nooses. Meanwhile, on the periphery of the case, Holiday is out on bail and something is brewing in the Gotham Underworld.To be honest, it felt like a retread of The Long Halloween for a while. Not bad but not really anything new. However, once the added wrinkle of some shady shit going down at the Haly Circus surfaced, I was all in.I've had a lot of favorite comic characters in the past four decades but Robin was the first. While I normally don't like retellings of characters origins, I enjoyed Loeb and Sale's take on Robin's origin quite a bit and it fit seamlessly with the rest of the day. The conflicted relationship between Harvey Dent and his former friends drove the rest of the book very well. I complain quite a bit about decompression in today's comics but it works great when Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale use it to tell a slow-burning mystery like The Long Halloween or Dark Victory. Just like the Long Halloween, the clues were in place but I missed them. Tim Sale's cartoony, moody art did a great job setting the tone, although I don't care for his Joker or Scarecrow. Loeb and Sale do a great Batman, too, complete with Kevin Conroy voice in my head.As far as sequels go, Dark Victory did a great job following up The Long Halloween. Four out of five Batarangs.",50,N/A

106076,Batman Dark Victory,Mizuki,"2,903",1156,5,"May 30, 2019","Rating: countless-god-damn-Batman-stars. I have so much love for this glorious volume and its prequel, Batman: The Long Halloween.
  Harvey. Grundy. Myself. Each of us lost pieces of our lives......and hid what was left in the dark, is this what I want for myself? A world that exists only in darkness?
Batman: Dark Victory continues the story of The Long Halloween, it concludes Harvey Dent's transformation into Two-Face, it also concludes Bruce Wayne's ill-fated relationship with Selina Kyle, then it introduces Dick Grayson as the first Robin.

Dark and gritty is the only way to go for Batman!!! The plot and the murder mystery is more neatly and more skillfully written than The Long Halloween ( too many Holiday Killers in one book!), the artwork and the air of the darkly attractive noir continues to be awesome. It literally is one of the best American comics I've ever read.(Link: http://metro.co.uk/2016/03/23/batman-...)Though I must admit as much as I like this volume, I still can see how the story borrowed so heavily from the Hollywood crime-noir e.g. The Godfather...*coughs* I mean *coughs* the horse head scene and all those crime families thingy. (they are actually called 'The Five Families' too in the comic)

106076,Batman Dark Victory,Ｆｒａｎｋｈ,845,157,3,"July 22, 2015","So, okay then. This is the sequel to The Long Halloween which I was not the biggest fan of to begin with. Still, on the enjoyment scale, this one was better. That was until I got to the last two issues. Ironically enough, while The Long Halloween had a rough start but a nonetheless merciful albeit incomplete resolution, Dark Victory managed to get a stronger and more concise beginning but a more frustrating and pointless ending. I don't understand this travesty. The Knightfall series is honestly more better written. Well, Loeb's stories should be fundamentally incomparable to Knightfall since the latter after all was written by multiple writers across different Bat-titles. The sole reason I compare them is becauase I was also quite lukewarm towards Knightfall but I would pick the omnibus series over either of Loeb's work any day.I don't want to get into details about Dark Victory. Ultimately it's a Batman story that brought no joy or appreciation for me. I thought I could like any kind of Bat-story out there (I eventually did warm up to Greg Hurwitz in his writing for New 52 The Dark Knight run) but Jeph Loeb had officially made me question that reality. I can state from here on out that I don't enjoy the way he writes Batman. There were a few areas that have potentials, most notably for Dark Victory. The central murder mystery story had a better foundation; a series of cop kilings with the murderer pinning notes on the corpses depicting the child's game Hangman as secret messages. At least the victims were sympathetic people and not criminals who are a tad more irredeemable. But the holiday-themed murders were needlessly overplayed like the torture horror of the SAW franchise.Next, both Batman and Commissioner Gordon show remorse and guilt over the loss of Harvey Dent. Batman spent most of the time blaming himself in his inner monologues about Dent's transformation to Two Face. This would have been acceptable except that I never really saw a friendship developed in the prequel among these three to make the drama and internal conflict believable enough for me to care about. And then there's the women. The female characterizations were easily  appalling and cheap as far as stereotypes and pigeonholing goes. Every woman is given the roles among grieving spouses, easily manipulated girlfriends and whimsical seductresses--and with little to no clarification for motivation or pay-off to their arcs whatsoever.I love Bruce and Selina's relationship in general but Loeb had accomplished the impossible feat: he made me hate them together. I couldn't stand their stupid dance of coquettish nonsense, especially so in Dark Victory. Aside from the badly drawn costume, Catwoman had a weak arc for both Loeb stories and therefore her usual morally ambiguous actions were not as promising or as riveting to see unfold. The only two women who are at least trying to break the mold were gangster Sofia Falcone and possible sociopath Gilda Dent who have interesting characterizations from the start but were sadly overlooked and underdeveloped midway through both stories.I don't even want to acknowledge the wasteful space female District Attorney Porter took up for Dark Victory. What a pathetic and unbelievable character. And goddamn Dick Grayson who is featured in the Absolute Dark Victory cover prominently doesn't even have a major contribution to the storyline. All he did here was sulk and look morose. He isn't Jason Todd or Damian Wayne, dammit. Where's the sparkling personality I've always loved about the first Boy Wonder?Overall--yeah, fuck it. I don't have any parting words. But I will rate this one star higher than fucking Long Halloween just because.RECOMMENDED: 7/10DO READ MY BATMAN COMICS REVIEWS AT:

106076,Batman Dark Victory,Sam Quixote,"4,424",12700,1,"August 12, 2011","I've read Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Batman books in the order they've written them with Haunted Knight coming first followed by The Long Hallowe'en and finally coming to Dark Victory. I suppose Loeb ought to be congratulated for bringing the Batman stories back to their original format, that is detective/crime stories, where he brings the mob and Batman side by side as natural enemies. Here's the story: a killer is killing people by hanging them on holidays (Hallowe'en, Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc) and leaving notes on their bodies with the hangman game on. Early on Arkham is attacked and the Batman's best loved villains escape (Joker, Two Face, Penguin, Poison Ivy, Riddler) and as the bodies pile up the pressure is on for Batman to stop this killer but he'll need help. Enter Robin. This ain't exactly gripping stuff. If you're like me and have read a fair number of Batman you'll already know this storyline reeks of The Long Hallowe'en. The storyline is practically identical with the holiday killer (this time not the weird Falcone guy but he's in this story too) being renamed the hangman killer and the villains all escaping and Batman encountering them laboriously one by one. Also do we need to hear the same old Robin origin story? This book is nearly 400 pages! 400 pages of rehashed material with nothing new at all. It's a chore to slog through even if you're new to Batman. Loeb can't seem to get out of 2nd gear while I'm beginning to see Sale as one of the worst Batman artists out there. Joker looks ridiculous, his smile isn't disturbing or grotesque it's stupid. It covers his entire face so that it's just a giant toothy smile with a tiny face above it. Bruce Wayne appears to be 7 feet tall. And what's with the tedious mafia characters? They're all boring stereotypes, eating spaghetti in restaurants thats a cover for smuggling operations! Come on. The press all have pieces of card with ""PRESS"" written on them and slotted into their hats. This is really a miss. If you've read The Long Hallowe'en then you can count reading this too as it's completely the same. Only difference is Robin and if you know anything about Batman you'll know what happens there. Give this a miss, it's a dull, dull story and for a character as interesting as Batman that's criminal. ",23,7
106076,Batman Dark Victory,Sud666,"1,895",156,5,"August 15, 2017","New 52 Batman and Re-birth batman fans take note: HERE IS HOW BATMAN SHOULD BE DONE! All Clear? Good.Dark Victory is the superb sequel to the excellent The Long Halloween. Brilliantly written by Jeph Loeb and artfully drawn by Tim Sale these two books were used, along with Frank Miller's DKR, to set the tone for Christopher Nolan's movies.Dark Victory takes up with Harvey Dent becoming Two-Face. There is a gang war going on in Gotham. This is during Batman's earlier years. You can see, as the story progresses, the ""normal"" criminal element of Gotham being phased out by the ""freaks"". There is so much to love here for any Batman fan. The best part is we see Batman as the Detective he is-something that sometimes gets left behind in recent tellings.This is a murder-mystery. The cast of villains is large and, I have to admit, didn't realize who the true killer was until the big reveal. Impressive. This Batman is brooding and dark. We rarely see Bruce Wayne, and then only for his interactions with Selina Kyle, because this is a Batman story. It is also a story of how Dick Grayson became Robin. I won't spoil any of the excellent plot so all I can say is- IMHO this, along with Long Halloween, is one of the finest Batman stories around. Period. Read it. Enjoy it. It is a true work of comic book art!",19,1 comment
106076,Batman Dark Victory,Tiag⊗ the Mutant,742,17,5,"December 1, 2022","Dark Victory is a brilliant follow up to The Long Halloween, the story follows the same formula of the last one and might feel a bit repetitive, but it grows stronger with the inclusion of Robin towards the end. These two books are probably the most quintessential Batman stories ever told, essential read for all DC fans, and a good pick for readers who are not fully into the genre but might be curious about the character, this will tell you all you need to know about the Dark Knight in the most adult fashion, highly recommended.",19,4

Dark Victory lived up to my expectations. I loved The Long Halloween, but I actually liked this a bit more. While I think this is an amazing follow up from The Long Halloween, some of my questions from the first one still remained unanswered, while some were finally put to a close. The conflict. The deceit. The twists. The turns. The action. I loved all of them.Full review to follow.",16,3

106076,Batman Dark Victory,Michael,97,1 follower,5,"October 7, 2021","This was a great sequel to The Long Halloween, I wasn’t sure if it was going to reach the same highs of the last book but it definitely did for me!So this is a similar concept to the last book where there is a mysterious murderer but this time is hanging police on holidays and Batman is trying to solve what is going on. For me, the mystery to the story was ok and I enjoyed it enough but the main part of this book I liked was just the developments of all of the characters and the city. It was great to see the origin of Robin and also the city get taken over by the supervillains. The art was still great in this book and it made for a good reading experience.Overall this is a great Batman book that I enjoyed reading, I think The Long Halloween had a better mystery to it but this story was a lot more than just the killings.",14,1 comment

106076,Batman Dark Victory,Frank,18,1 follower,4,"August 6, 2011","Let's face it, a majority of Batman readers hate Robin. Why? No clue. I always thought he was a nice contrast to Batman's loner characteristics. A lot of people mention that Robin doesn't fit a Batman story, and that's because Robin ""is nothing like Batman because Batman has always fought alone"". Well, I would love to agree with those people, but I would be a liar if I did.First of all, about Robin, this graphic novel does explain Robin's origin. Dick Grayson (the first Robin) loses his parents in an accident similar to Bruce Wayne's parents, and Bruce decides to take him in because he feels sorry for him. However, Dick wants justice, and in time Batman reveals himself as Bruce Wayne to the young Dick Grayson. Bruce trains Dick, blah blah blah...You get the dynamic duo. I just wanted to point out that Batman and Robin may not have similar personalities, but they share similar traumas.Now, the book is often referred to as ""the origin of Robin"". That is a pretty far off description as Dick Grayson doesn't appear until the second half of the book, and only helps Batman a little during the end. This story is actually a sequel to Batman: The Long Halloween, and continues the story of the Holiday killer and Falcone mafia family, as well as Harvey Dent and his rough new life as Two Face. The plot is almost identical to the one in Long Halloween: There is a killer known as the ""Hang Man"", and he/she is killing cops and leaving hang man (the game) clues on each of the bodies. Just like Long Halloween, Jeph Loeb does a great writing job to make you suspect everyone in the story as well as some dead characters. Is it Harvey Dent (now Two Face), a Falcone, the new District Attorney, or someone else? You will have to read to find out.Overall, the book kept me reading. The mystery gets you guessing at who the real killer is, and has a nice reveal at the end. The 4 star rating is because the plot was strikingly similar to the one in Long Halloween, but there were differences to make them two completely different stories. The art, by Tim Sale, is amazing because...It's Tim Sale. Also, if you are a fan of Batman villains, there are over seven present in the story, so there is a nice variety of Batman fights going down.I highly recommend this to Batman lovers and graphic-novel-readers- alike. However, do yourself a favor and read the amazing Batman: The Long Halloween. It will help you understand the story better and it is a great read. ",12,3
