7667,Airframe,Kay ‚ù¶,"1,879",582,4,"May 21, 2022","I love good disaster novels and movies. Airframe is a great read but not what I had in mind. This is not your typical action air disaster thriller but one that focuses on the investigation and is filled with aerodynamics and plane lingo. Yet, Michael Crichton can deliver this science-heavy novel and make it enjoyable for this casual reader. üôèTransPacific Airlines, TPA 545 inbound from Hong Kong to Denver made an emergency call to Los Angeles air traffic control after the plane experienced uncontrollable deep dives and climbs and was within five hundred feet of hitting the Pacific Ocean. The cabin was barely intact resulting in four casualties and over fifty injuries. It makes you wonder what was wrong with the plane? üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏èSingle mom Casey Singleton VP of QA at Norton Aircraft in Burbank, CA is in the midst of the investigation. She deals with the FAA, lawyers, and the press that tries to get up-to-minute updates on the incident. I like her character, she's cool, smart, professional, and confident. I listened to the book along with an ebook copy which I highly recommend. I like Frances Cassidy's narration and I found having a book is a great help when communications, printouts, and news articles are visual. Listening to data made very little sense, but with a book (still made little sense LOL) I see what it looks like! Jurassic Park is my next Crichton book. ü¶ïü•ºüß™",140,54
7667,Airframe,Richard Derus,"2,855",1884,3,"July 15, 2013","Rating: 3.5 breathless stars of fiveI really hate flying. I'm not scared of it, I just dislike being herded into inky-dinky seats meant for short people by ill-tempered sky-waiters who charge for pillows and booze, and then I have to pay more than I used to make a week for the privilege of being searched, patted by men I'm not attracted to in places I don't want to be patted unless I am, etc etc etc.Fifteen years ago, all that was more or less to come, and storymonger Crichton used planes for a very different kind of tale. What happens to cause a huge section of a plane to go *flooey*, killing a few people and making the entire world nervous about flying? We're about to find out, Casey Singleton and the reader that is. We're going to go into surprisingly interesting amounts of detail about the structure, the manufacture, the sales, the service, the use of airplanes, and how a careful planner could cause huge havoc in a few, small, seemingly innocuous ways.I miss Michael Crichton. He understood the value of detail, the urgency of tight plotting, and the uncomplicated pleasure of following a complicated and logical plot to its only possible ending. If I didn't have Steve Berry, I'd be visiting Crichton's grave once a year with 200 roses to mourn his passing.LitSnobs take note...turn up your noses and all that happens is us groundlings who like books that are fun get an unobstructed view of your boogers.",70,13
7667,Airframe,W,"1,185",4,4,"November 27, 2020","A plane is struggling to land,and sends out a distress call,asking for forty ambulances to be available for possible casualties.It is a compelling start to this techno thriller.Later,however,there is a lot of detail about the technicilaties of aircraft manufacture.When I used to step into an aeroplane,I never worried much about safety.I didn't hate flying.But in recent years,there have been so many aircraft crashes that have made me wonder,how safe air travel really is.This is my favourite Crichton book.It raises some uncomfortable questions about the quality control standards followed by the aircraft manufacturing industry,and the safety of air travel in general.",60,9
7667,Airframe,Debbie Zapata,"1,731",26,3,"October 30, 2015","I read this book aloud to my husband during the past week or so, and parts of it were very dramatic, but other parts (all those charts!) were a bit dull even though we knew they were important. I don't know how a narrator for an audio version would read them, I either handed the book to Marco and let him see for himself, or else I just said 'lots of numbers that I am not going to read'. We got the gist of it all anyway.Casey Singleton is in charge of a team trying to figure out what went wrong on flight 545, which did not crash but had a severe inflight 'incident'. There are many layers to what is involved, and it seems that everyone around her has some reason to keep her from finding out the truth. Typical Chrichton fast moving story, but it does tend to porpoise a bit just like the plane itself did. We would just get super interested in the action when the story would stall out into technical details or background or the introduction of a new character and take a nosedive. I learned a great new expression, shouted in disgust by one of the airplane manufacturer's engineers when he is examining the engine and discovers something that is not the way it should be, even though he insists it could not have contributed to the 'incident'. ""Fuck a hairy duck!""  With apologies to anyone who may be offended by that, I hope I can remember to use it once in awhile! ",34,4
7667,Airframe,Linda,128,7,4,"August 17, 2013","As someone who worked most of my life in Aerospace, on the supersonic B-1 bomber, and then on several Titan missile and launch vehicle programs, I found the book well researched. There were a few times when I said to myself, ""In what manufacturing area would THAT occur?"" But he's right on with the incessant use of acronyms, and the increasing prevalence of cost-cutting maneuvers that end up compromising flight safety. And I believe he's right on about the maneuvers of the airline companies that buy the airframes and follow (or don't follow) the recommended maintenance procedures. However, never having worked for an airline or been familiar with their maintenance programs, I can't say that with certainty.I liked the female aerospace manager, having been one myself, and while others on Goodreads have written here that Crichton tends to populate his books with stereotypical characters, I say hooray for acknowledging that there are now women in aerospace who (a) have engineering degrees and well-honed critical thinking skills, and (b) have drilled through the difficult-to-penetrate glass ceiling.",29,1 comment
7667,Airframe,Jay,38,1 follower,3,"August 20, 2007","Mike gave me this book when we visited him, Anna, and Kaley at their Woodbridge apt--jesus it must be 3 or 4 (or 5?) years ago. I remember how funny he was about it. Convo went something like this:------------MS: Hey Jay - I got this book for you to haveme: Oh really? Well, what's it about?MS: Pfft... fuck if I know. Anna tried it. I tried it. Too many goddamn acronyms in it. me: (laughs)MS: I'm serious, dude. It's all about an airliner crash. But the fuckin author uses every acronym under the sun. NTSB this.. FAA that.. The FBI, the CIA, the PIC, SIC, OR--I'm like Grrrr FUCK THIS BOOK. I tried several times. Can't do it.me: (probably spitting my wine all over the balcony and choking on my laughter)MS: Dude take it. I'm serious. You're a pilot. You can decipher all these fuckin codes. I'm giving it to you or we burn it here and now.me: Okay, Mikey - I'll take it.------------And that's why it sits on my bookshelf today.Was it good? I honestly don't remember every detail, but I enjoyed it. But mostly I enjoy thinking about that night. We were also visiting Mike n Anna at that apt when my dad called and told me my Nanny died.

7667,Airframe,Matthew,"1,219",8681,4,"April 2, 2013","I enjoyed this book, but for me, it does follow what I find to be the usual Michael Crichton formula: really entertaining and suspenseful story with a lot of energy put into detail (in this case, he put in a lot of infomation about airplanes, which I found to be very interesting), but the end is weak and unbelievable. I have found this to be the case with several of his other novels - almost like he just didn't know how to end a book.But, his stories are interesting enough that despite the weak endings, I will keep reading.",22,2
7667,Airframe,Anu,364,883,4,"March 10, 2016","I will be putting up my review of Stoner tomorrow, I promise; I need to fine tune it some.But more to the point, Airframe was a book that I enjoyed quite some time back. My mother is a huge fan of Crichton, and as a result, we have his whole collection at home. I was about 15 when she (mother dearest) first read Airframe, and I very vividly remember her raving about it. Being an engineer herself, it was quite obvious that she would enjoy it. And being as far from being an engineer as can be, I wasn't too sure about the book when I picked it up. But amazing, it was. Crichton seamlessly blends the science fiction element into his thrillers, and I think that;s why his books are as good as they are. The technicalities, the jargon; they never feel like info dump; rather like necessary elements to the story, without which it would be woefully incomplete. His characters in this book, much like the characters in most of his books are forgettable to say the least, but his story, on the other hand is among memorable ones I've read. At the risk of sounding like I'm answering an exam paper, I also feel that Crichton somehow delivers his story with a kind of completeness, or well-rounded-ness to it. In this story, for instance, a story about a plane that uncharacteristically crashed, Crichton not only expertly explores the technical aspect of the investigation, but also such things as media interference and common office politics. Despite all these elements though, Airframe doesn't stray far from what it really is, a thriller at its heart. With a twist ending, of course. Casey Somethingortheother is the single mother of a teenager, as well as the VP of Quality assurance at Norton, the creator of the titular airframe that crashed. She is entrusted with the task of investigating the crash, and of proving that the airframe itself wasn't responsible for the crash. With a little help from her friends, including Doug (the engineer), Ted (the test pilot and booty call), Ken and someone else from the Incident Review Team, as well as enemies like former musician turned FAA employee Baker, Casey investigates the shit out of this case, while at the same time dealing with her asshole assistant (Ben or Bob or something), who is a part of the Norton family tree. Even though Crichton died before I got my hands on this book, I must say I do miss him. He used to write some good stuff, some really good stuff. ",21,4
7667,Airframe,Eric_W,"1,914",347,4,"February 1, 2009","This is my first Crichton since the Andromeda Strain written so many years ago. Another reason to ignore the professional critics who have not been terribly kind to Crichton in the past few years. I really liked this book. It has a marvelous blend of science, information and a good plot that keeps the pages turning.It‚Äôs interesting that many of the reviews I read focused on the aircraft industry. I think the book is more about the media and it‚Äôs relentless pursuit of the visual and the sound bite at the expense of truth and the whole picture more than about airplanes.Enroute from Hong Kong to Denver, a brand new Norton-22, a plane clearly modeled on the Boeing 747, pitches and dives like a porpoise before being brought under control. The violent maneuvers kill three passengers and injures 56 others. . The airline's VP in charge of quality assurance ‚Äî Casey Singleton ‚Äî has to find out why, before more passengers and the airline's future go into a tailspin. As always in Crichton's expert hands, readers learn a lot about science while becoming enmeshed in the power-plays, office politics, and pressures of the global market and American jobs. Her job is complicated, because, as we gradually learn, powers within the company are trying to manipulate her and to embarrass the company so that the president of the company can be forced out in favor of another. Casey is saddled with a Norton family nephew who turns out to be a spy for one of the other company officers. We learn a great deal about aircraft manufacture and design ‚Äî I must admit to really loving the technical detail ‚Äî as Casey tries to figure out why the cockpit reports of turbulence differ from physical evidence of a ‚Äúcommanded slat deployment,‚Äù something, that even had it occurred at altitude and high speed should not have caused the plane to go out-of-control the way it appears to have done.Crichton obviously doesn‚Äôt like lawyers, their stoolies (an ex-FAA employee who testifies for the plaintiffs in injury suits figures prominently in the media‚Äôs desire to create a nasty story) nor the media, and a character clearly modeled after Mike Wallace has few redeeming qualities. At one point Casey is to be interviewed by the Wallace character, Marty Reardon, and a company PR person comes by to help her prepare a little. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one more thing I can tell you, Katherine. You work in a complex business. If you try to explain that complexity to Marty, you‚Äôll be frustrated. You‚Äôll feel he isn‚Äôt interested. He‚Äôll probably cut you off. Because he isn‚Äôt interested. A lot of people complain television lacks focus. But that‚Äôs the nature of the medium. Television‚Äôs not about information at all. Information is active, engaging. Television is passive. Information is disinterested, objective. Television is emotional. It‚Äôs entertainment. . . . [Marty‚Äôs:] paid to exercise his one reliable talent: provoking people, getting them to make an emotional outburst, to lose their temper, to say something outrageous. He doesn‚Äôt really want to know about airplanes. He wants a media moment.‚ÄùCasey‚Äôs father was a journalist and an old friend of his remarks at the end of the book, ‚ÄúUsed to be ‚Äî in the old days-- the media image roughly corresponded to reality. But now it‚Äôs all reversed. The media image is the reality, and by comparison day-to-day life seems to lack excitement. So now day-to-day life is false, and the media image is true. Sometimes I look around my living room, and the most real thing in the room is the television. It‚Äôs bright and vivid, and the rest of my life looks drab. So I turn the damn thing off. That does it every time. Get my life back.‚Äù",18,3
7667,Airframe,Ed,855,108,1,"November 28, 2009","When Michael Crichton is good he is very, very good but this effort is just plain horrible. The only reason I finished it is due to my obsession about not wanting to miss anything. I found myself reading the first sentence of paragraphs and skipping the rest to move more quickly to the end. I don't think I missed anything doing it that way.The characters are stereotyped beyond belief: the hard working but put upon single mother, the brusque and impatient boss, the techy nerds, the debonair test pilot, the slimy industrial spy, the good-hearted mentor, the young, overly ambitious news producer, and on and on.The plot involves an incident on a Norton Aircraft passenger liner that is complicated by a pending sale of the same model to China, a union action to stall manufacturing offsets going to China as a condition of the sale, internal company politics, and a pending ""Newsline"" story about unsafe Norton aircraft. There may have been others. Chrichton had to do something to fill 400+ pages.I had pretty much figured out how it was going to end about 150 pages in. Except for some details, I made a pretty accurate guess. There were a few surprises but overall it was a predictable story with a predictable ending. I wonder if the aircraft industry subsidized Chrichton's efforts.On the positive side, I did learn some things about the aircraft industry, how accidents are investigated, and more than I wanted to know about the acronyms used in the industry.If you are a died in the wool Crichton fan or are stuck on a long flight with nothing else to read, I can recommend this book to you. Other than that there are just too many good Michael Crichton books as well as books about the aircraft industry. You would be better served reading those. ",17,17
7667,Airframe,Cathy,"1,582",233,3,"September 26, 2020","Read this a while ago. Back then I probably would have given it four or five stars, but tastes change. I remember starting to read this, while sitting in a plane, about to hurl itself down a runway to take-off and thinking ""How stupid can I be?"" If you want some well written, fast paced entertainment, without having to engage too much brain power, this is a good choice. Unless you are afraid of flying... ;)",17,2
7667,Airframe,Rade ,320,48,3,"April 22, 2015","One of those books that I liked but did not like enough. Like most of his other books, this one is well researched by Crichton but I guess not enough to hold my full attention. The beginning was ""fun"", for a lack of a better word (how fun can airplane accidents be?!?) and even the whole technology mumbo jumbo was somewhat fun (trust me, there is a lot of it) but than the political thing came along where contracts were threatened due to safety issues/concerns and my brain tried to turn itself off. I kept it on but the batteries were losing power up there. I understand at some point it will get all business-y but I wasn't looking forward to it. The ending was good but I feel like it was not big enough hook or a twist to make me give the book enough stars. Still, I am giving it at least 3 stars just because I like Crichton and his style. This one is on a ""mehh"" scale for me but that is not to say that it was a bad book or a bad read. In fact, I could have read this book in a day or two if I did not have work. Chapters were few pages each and they read very fast. ",13,4
7667,Airframe,Dannii Elle,"1,966",1380,3,"August 6, 2022","Crichton's Jurassic Park and its sequel, The Lost World, remain two of my favourite sci-fi stories to read, but I have found his other work to not appeal in quite the same way. Perhaps this is due to the nostalgia I already felt to the dinosaur world, having grown up with the film adaptations, or maybe I just gelled better with those particular storylines. I still commend this author for his continued inventiveness and the seemingly sound scientific inclusions that feature heavily and throughout, but something just doesn't keep me wholly invested, here and in his other work that I have so far read.The synopsis intrigued me with the lines: ""Ninety-four passengers are injured. Three dead. The interior cabin virtually destroyed."" I was eager to uncover the mysteries surrounding the plane crash and explore the lives of those on-board it. Both of these were delivered.Where I believe this novel failed for me was in the action and adventure that I anticipated would also be included. The pacing felt a little stodgy in areas, so absolutely was the focus on the scientific reasoning for the plane's crash, when I was more interested in being delivered pace-heightening pursuits and action-packed scenes.",12,N/A
7667,Airframe,Ashley,"2,550",1632,3,"September 14, 2021","This is the epitome of a three star read. I liked it overall, but it was very dated, and has that signature Crichton lack of character development in favor of extreme technical detail. About 200 pages from the end, though, the tension really picked up, and I did end up enjoying it. This is essentially a book about the aftermath of an airplane disaster in which there are fifty-six casualties, and three deaths. The incident comes at a very bad time for Norton Aircraft, who are in the process of finalizing a huge sale to China of fifty planes that would secure the company's financial future. Our main character, who is essentially an avatar for the investigation and not so much a three dimensional human, is Casey Singleton, the vice-president of Quality Control for Norton, and it's her job to figure out what actually happened on the airplane. Was it mechanical failure? Pilot error? There is A LOT of information about how airplanes are built, how they work, and what happens behind the scenes when something goes wrong on a plane. Especially in the middle, it was overwhelming. I skipped a lot of the technical stuff. Also, Michael Crichton must have really had it out for the press, because there's a plot in here all about how journalists (on TV mostly) don't care about details or facts, and actively misrepresent things in ways that harm people (and companies - boo hoo). This was simultaneously prescient given the existence of fake news (which could be read as an evolution of this), and also had the feeling of an old man yelling at clouds. Crichton got his kicks out by torturing the hell out of the (young and female!) reporter on a plane during a test flight. At one point during the flight, vomit literally runs out between her fingers. Lesson learned, young female journalist! I don't feel like getting into the background casual sexism and racism, but they were unfortunately par for the course for a 1996 novel. Anyway, not mad I read this, but definitely not a favorite.",11,5
7667,Airframe,Dylan,8,1 follower,4,"January 28, 2014","Michael Crichton is a master of taking complicated subjects and easing the reader into them while at the same time making the characters seem well immersed in the details. Airframe is a novel about airplanes, and specifically an investigation into a plane accident by the plane's manufacturer. Though all the characters know more about airplanes than you ever will, Crichton has presented a spectacular mixture of in-depth research and understandable explanations. Not only by the end of the novel did I understand way more about airplanes, including not only the machines themselves but also the complex politics behind the manufacturing industry, but I quickly found myself following along with the technical details of the investigation. This is a mystery novel, filled with suspense and even a couple action scenes, and it kept me engaged throughout. I highly recommend it.",11,N/A
