7959473,American Assassin,Marcie,251,52,3,"September 3, 2011","They need to hire me to proof for them. I’ve come across more than a few books with an unacceptable amount of typos here lately. Is no one reading this stuff before it goes to press?And I’m not that much of an anal freak, but 20 typos before page 78 is too many.The reason for my annoyance is because Vince Flynn is a great writer, and I believe I read he is dyslexic, thus he does not have a dedicated team supporting him. That’s a shame because his Mitch Rapp novels tap into the raw emotion of real America right now, unleashing all our fury against radical Islam.In this 11th novel we meet the man who trained Mitch, the mentor, and he is a fantastic, larger-than-life character. I laughed so hard during his torture scenes with the terrorists. Terrific drama.Vince Flynn reminds us of who we’re supposed to be, and what America is supposed to be about. We’re the best, the baddest, the smartest, the meanest mo-fo on the planet.At least we can still have our fantasies in Vince Flynn’s Mitch Rapp novels.",116,37
7959473,American Assassin,David Johnston,25,24,5,"August 5, 2011","Some people are addicted to drugs. I am happily addicted to Vince Flynn's books and the exploits of his truly American hero, Mitch Rapp. My wife and daughter share my addiction, but they have not had their fix yet because I got to read Flynn's newest book first. Which is only fair since I bought it. My only complaint is that now I will have to wait another year for the next book. Withdrawal can be tough.Oh, about the book? C'mon, it's Vince Flynn and Mitch Rapp. This one is about how Mitch got his start in the assassin business before he became the star player in the war on terror and before there was an official war on terror. It is set before 9-11 when some in the clandestine services discerned radical Islamic terror clouds approaching and were trying to prepare for it (remember this is fiction). The result was...Mitch Rapp whose name Islamofacists use to frighten their children with into good behavior when they are not strapping suicide vests on them to kill innocent men women and children. If they ever make a movie based on a Vince Flynn book, this is one I would vote for. That is as long as they were faithful to the book. Otherwise they might tick Vince and Mitch off.",78,8
7959473,American Assassin,Vijai,207,56,2,"December 9, 2013","Look, here's something about us diehard action-thriller fanboys - we will forgive an author's imprudence with a few weak spots in the plot now and then as long as we get our action-gasm in totality but what we don't do is tolerate preachy one-sided-win story. Two ingredients which this author is dishing out in heaps in this book. I am not even going to talk about the piss poor editing, its the gross injustice that has been meted out to Mitch Rapp that I am very disappointed with. It took Mr. Flynn exactly three pages to span through Rapp's metamorphosis from a teenager who loses his father to a young adult who loses his first love to become this lethal moral compass all of us have come to love. What? this is Mitch Rapp, the one man army who is that one hope of retribution against the wrong doers, you cannot chalk that up to Irene's exceptional talent hunting skills! all of it justified by making Hurley the bad guy and Stanfield convincing him that he may just have goofed up. NO, you need to take us into the man's head, show us his raw emotions harden into metal and sharpened by balls to the walls kinda training. Instead, what we are shown is that Rapp was an awesome guy all the while. Not to mention the recent trend of brushing a familial touch to justify the loyalty among the characters; Irene thinks of Rapp as her brother, Hurley thinks of Irene as his niece (justifiable by the back-story thankfully provided but come on!) etc., this is not even coming to close Jason Bourne and his son Khan's dismally written about bonding. One of the praises very prominently printed on my copy of this book said something to the effect that Mr.Flynn has an eye on Lee Child's action-thriller throne. The fact that this book is ""trying"" (very hard) to draw a parallel to Jack Reacher's phenomenal knuckle crunching early-days context story ""The Enemy"" is not lost on us and I would like to take this opportunity to call FAIL on that. Not with this book, no sir. ",62,12
7959473,American Assassin,Tim,"2,084",188,4,"April 29, 2019","After the first quarter of this novel, which is unnecessarily long, the book gets significantly better. It’s good to finally see Vince Flynn back in form with his Mitch Rapp character after a long lull. 9 of 10 stars",44,N/A
7959473,American Assassin,* A Reader Obsessed *,"2,079",424,3,"October 12, 2017","3.5 Stars I’m not gonna lie. The majority of the reason why I started this series was because a certain somebody is starring in the movie version out this September. So as a fangirl, it’s only prudent and necessary to see what this is all about. It’s also not a secret that I love me a military spy action thriller, and with the added bonus of DoB?? That combo is just too hard to resist.  Depending on what kind of reader you are, you can start with Transfer of Power, which was the first book published, or here, if you’re a chronological purist. This shows the why and how Mitch Rapp becomes the CIA’s most indispensible, top counter-terrorist agent. What begins as a way to deliver retribution to those responsible for the death of his high school sweetheart, turns into something so much more. Rapp is the whole package of well honed athletic talent, no nonsense attitude, nerves of steel, quick thinking and adaptability, coupled with dogged determination and the ability to think way outside the box. Such an autonomous attitude never goes down easily with those way above his pay grade, but it surely is warranted, making Rapp possibly one of the best that the agency’s seen in… well... never. He’s no cookie cutter company man! So, see how it all begins with this installment. It makes me happy to know there’s many more to go, which means if the movie is successful, we have a great franchise to look forward to! One can only hope!",42,19
7959473,American Assassin,Brenda,"3,972",2585,4,"August 8, 2018","Twenty-three-year-old Mitch Rapp was recruited by Irene Kennedy into a group of highly trained yet clandestine operatives, a division of the CIA. A top athlete, Rapp was incredibly fit and after six months of intense training, he was on his way to his first job in Istanbul. He gave a final thought to the more than two hundred passengers who had lost their lives that day in the Pan Am Lockerbie terrorist attack – retribution was looking good.As Rapp worked his way across Europe, he finally found himself in Beirut on a mission of recovery. But would it all go wrong? Would he find himself in the hands of the terrorists himself? The skills he had learned; the devious nature of the hunt – could he survive and achieve his goal? Mitch Rapp was the new kid on the block…American Assassin is the first in the Mitch Rapp series by Vince Flynn and I enjoyed it very much. Fast paced, intense and chilling, this spy thriller has plenty of twists and turns, loads of action, and a hero who is worth reading about. Highly recommended.",34,8
7959473,American Assassin,Hiroto,241,62,1,"March 15, 2017","Oh Dylan, Dylan, Dylan my good dude why.Where do I start? The character development is piss poor. So our good Mitch Rapp (wtf is this name? it sounds so dumb??) lost his father at 13yo because of a heart attack and his highschool sweetheart in a terrorist attack so he's super familiar with death (ok?) and his heart is bursting with REVENGE. Coincidentally he's picked out by Langlsey wich is like a branch of the CIA, even thought he didn't do antyhing to be noticed (ok??) and he's sent off to a six-months training of the death where he excells at everything and learns super fast because he's an athlete you know, he was super good at lacrosse in highschool and he can run at the speed of the light (ok????) and then wooish he's sent to Beirut to do his first kill (ok???????).Really.Though it has to be noted that the book actually follow 4 POVs : the russian's, switching between Ivankov and his subaltern, the Libyan's with Sayyed (who's the most developped I think, the character was gimmicky but not outrigh cliché), and two Americans : Mitch Rapp's- pfffrh that name- and Hursley's. The latter is the most dumb and grossly written character of the book, but he's entertaining (like, at the end of his very first POV, we learn that he pisses in the bush of his very cool estate. ok? I don't give a damn? I don't know what that adds to the story, and that actually doesn't say a lot about this character). I think it says a lot when I thought Mitch Rapp's -honhonhon- POV was the most boring to me.There's one thing the book does right I think : a lot of the usually faceless muslims villains are actually named, and we do follow them a good chunk of the book. So if the upcoming film (why did you think I read this book in the first place) follows the same pace and story, maybe we'll have actors with names and talent playing them, and they'll have screentime, and wouldn't that be a nice change ?Thought I read somewhere they cast a turkish actress I think, and I have no idea what her role will be, since the only two named female characters of this book are both white and blonde.The writing isn't that great either, I did spot typos and a lot of phrases like ""you’d expect from someone who was expected to"", this book wasn't edited properly. Also I could have started a new drinking game where I take a shot every time the words ""trained/training"" appeared (spoiler : a lot). There were a lot of gimmicky phrase such as ""million years of survival instincts embedded into the human brain like gene"".Annnnd the two main things I didn't like about it : this book was very, and I mean very, black & white, bad guys vs. good guys (there's even a character saying this exact phrase ""well, let's just say I believe in good guys and bad guys"" wow). The second point is : the author's opinions is always interfering in the book, like ""he saw communism for the sham it was"" or a phrase about stupid people covering their women with sheets (funny reading that in a book where the word ""pussy"" is written a least 6 times, talk about sexism ahahah).Now, i haven't read a lot of books of this gendra. Maybe it's the norm, it's suppposed to make the americans readers feel like the baddest mofo in the planet. As an europpean one though, it felt laughable and super cliché, we always make fun of this type of movies where the white dude is super badass and kill everything. That's why I giggled in the more ridiculous parts.I won't mention the plotholes because, welp, but I will add that there weren't even that much of action. I expected to feel at least some tension, but I wasn't pumped up in the slightest.So yeah, Dylan, I hope the script is better than this, I keep imagining something à la ""The Raid"" like the whole film is about the rescue mission (but it's only like ~20pages in the book). I don't understand why you'd sign another franchise, but you know, good luck my dude, have fun.",29,22
7959473,American Assassin,Matthew,"1,219",8681,4,"January 12, 2019","I have read a couple of the other books in the Mitch Rapp series in the order they were published. Those books came later in the story timeline than American Assassin. When I found out that they published a couple of prequel books, I figured I would go back and give them a try.American Assassin is just about what you would expect from a political/military/spy thriller. That is not a bad thing! You get all kinds of plotting, action, and badassery. As this is a prequel in the series, it is not in the post 9/11 era, but closer to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet Union, and the terrorist bombing of the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland.A couple things about these types of books that is not a complaint or a praise. Just an observation of two common tropes for this genre:Torture: They really like their torture in these books. The nastier, more uncomfortable, the more painful, the better. So, if you like description of fingernails being ripped out and electrodes being attached to genitals, then this is the genre for you.Confusion: Since deception and undercover work is the name of the game, many times I get lost with these books. Who is on which side? What is the ultimate endgame of the current mission behind enemy lines? Isn't he talking to a guy who just killed his friend in the previous scene but now they are on the same side? It's something I have come to expect and it usually all makes sense in the end.What it comes down to is this: you like this genre, you will like this book.",29,2
7959473,American Assassin,Scott,404,41,4,"April 16, 2017","Let me start with a couple of important points before I get knee deep in my review. First, this is my first time reading a Vince Flynn “Mitch Rapp” book. I have a friend who enjoys reading Lee Child’s “Reacher” series like I do, and he recommended this series to me. Second, I understand there was a less than stellar editing work done on this book in the series as noted in several of the Goodreads reviews I read online. I agree with these points, but am moving past them.Now for my review… Wow! I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, I think that I was expecting a hardcore military hero that was invincible and boring. Well, that is not the case. It must be noted that this is not the first book written in the series, but part of two prequel books that help explain the main character, Mitch Rapp’s, evolution into the strong character he is in the other books. I chose to start here so I could see his beginning. And what a beginning he has… Mitch Rapp gets recruited into an “off book” group of American assassins who help the U.S. government do what it cannot openly admit to publicly. This includes meeting his trainer and mentor, his first mission, and the set-up of his organizational team during the growth of terrorism in the middle east.Why did I like the book? The characters, plotting, and fast moving intertwining plot lines that come together at the end were all strong points of the book. The establishment of the aging and experienced Hurley as Rapp’s trainer and mentor was one the most interesting things in the book. Hurley’s character stole the show at times and demanded the reader’s attention. Rapp’s growth and development in his first couple of missions was engrossing and tough to stop reading. There were some preachy moments, but the three-pronged - American / terrorist jihad / Russian - storylines built well and came to an exciting and tension filled climax.Overall, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this first Mitch Rapp adventure. So much so, I immediately bought the second prequel book, “Kill Shot” on my Amazon Kindle. I love reading suspense and thriller authors like Lee Child and David Baldacci, and am now adding Vince Flynn to my list. If you haven’t, maybe you should give Flynn’s “Mitch Rapp” a try too.",28,N/A
7959473,American Assassin,Sara,564,169,5,"January 16, 2011","This was exceptional with one disclaimer... it was obviously rushed to publishing with little editing. While waiting for my copy to arrive I read that other fans had noticed more than the occasional typos in the text and were bothered by them. I wondered if perhaps they were being a little over the top. Unfortunately, I found myself equally bothered. It is understandable that sometimes a ""i"" will be replaced with an ""l"" (as in the word ""cabbie"" being written as ""cabble"" in the last portion of the book) but in one area an entire name was substituted with the name of a different primary character who was most certainly not present in the room - this kind of error attacked the rhythm and flow of the book and distracted me on too many occasions. It is a shame that such a great story was marred by so many glaring errors.I saw the interview with Vince Flynn after the release of the book and remembered him saying that in this prequel even he ""learned things about Mitch Rapp"" that he did not previously know. I was struck, while reading, about how true that is. Rapp is a great character who has always been easy to root for. This book only furthers my affection for him and my desire to know him more. The end of the book left a number of things teased or unanswered leaving me wondering if there are more prequels to come. Without question I enjoyed the story, was angry and unnerved by the realistic implications of the plot and my gratitude for real American Black Ops was furthered. While reading this I cannot help but think of Winston Churchill's famous quote: ""never was so much owed by so many to so few."" Between Tom Clancy, Vince Flynn, The Unit and 24, I do hope that our culture will embrace the ugly reality that the face of war has changed and what we hold most dear is not nearly as safe as we would hope.

7959473,American Assassin,Kay ❦,"1,879",582,5,"June 30, 2021","I'm half done through the book, one word, wow!I have enjoyed the storyline and definitely a new fan of Mitch Rapp series. I am looking forward and hope the new author will continue the series Mr. Flynn started. The bad: Did they hire a new editor for the new book. The number of typos would have given me a C in college if not worse. I borrowed this book from the library and it is the first time I saw people corrected all the mistakes.",20,1 comment
7959473,American Assassin,Matt,"3,613",12800,3,"July 28, 2011","A decent prequel to the entire MITCH RAPP series, though i did not feel it was Flynn's best. It introduces us to the renegade agent that RAPP becomes and how he got that ice water running through his veins.",20,4
7959473,American Assassin,Lindsay,65,2,2,"August 7, 2012","I was curious about the Vince Flynn series featuring Mitch Rapp since the books do well on the NY Times Bestseller list and I like thrillers. I was less than thrilled to see endorsements by folks of the Glenn Beck ilk. Nevertheless, I read this book, and likened it to a ""less well-written-than-the-Bourne-series"" book. In other words, I prefer the writing of Robert Ludlum. This is a spy versus spy story, with the requisite close calls, seemingly impossible dilemmas, and shoot-outs. A bit too much torture for me, and I think the characters are two-dimensional. I also didn't like the fact that virtually all the Russians and Arabs are super-evil and all the Americans are the white-hat guys and gals. Stereotypes and nationalism are to be expected, but I would have found this book to be better if the characters and cultures weren't portrayed in such a cardboard manner. That being said, it did pass the time and was mildly entertaining. I hear that this book is the basis of an upcoming film. I hope the film avoids such broad sweeps.",19,9
7959473,American Assassin,Doug Bradshaw,257,218,4,"July 19, 2011","This is good tough American male stuff. I enjoyed as much as some of you women readers enjoy a romance novel with handsome vampires and whatnot. It made me almost laugh to read it, like going back in time to the joy of reading my first three or four Ludlum novels. This is the 11th book in a series about a CIA assassin named Mitch Rapp. It is the prequel to the other already told stories and I was told I may as well read it first. It's not quite as sophisticated as Jack Bauer and ""24"", but it has that same tough agent willing to do what it takes even if it means ignoring the more politically correct bosses, attitude. Here is a simple, likable, extremely tough athletic guy willing to sacrifice his limbs and life to beat the terrorists. The toughest and most pure quarterback you'll ever meet. And he's able, as a young guy, to show the leaders at the top how it needs to be done and how they have strayed from their real missions and directives by being too politically correct.Sort of like the warnings the drug companies have to give us on TV, there is extreme violence, graphic killing, the toughest, worst, sob drill sergeant ever, a little romance but nothing you women will enjoy, and other such fun and games.I loved it and will now go to the first in the series. I'd give it five stars, but I'm afraid some of my old English Professors may be reading this and, the book certainly isn't literature. But it is efficient, has some great moments and will give you a vicarious thrill here and there, although, sometimes, perhaps, a little over the top. But I'd never cut anything out if I were the editor.  ",18,7

  ”Retribution is a punishment that is morally right and fully deserved.” 
 This was even better than expected! It’s Tom Clancy minus the infodumps, James Bond with out the misogyny and absurdity, Jason Bourn without all the mystery - This. Was. Good.Mitch Rapp is a gifted college athlete who lost the love of his life when terrorist put a bomb on Pan Am Flight 103- it exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. This transformed Rapp and he came to the notice of Irene Kennedy, CIA, who had been looking for a special assassin due to the US’s escalating Middle East issues.I need to take a minute to admire Vince Flynn for daring to mention Iran Air Flight 655 Tom Clancy never had balls that big.I can now say the movie was an excellent update to the book and I hope they make many more. All Vince Flynn is officially TBR!Best of the espionage action thriller genre. Five stars.",17,3
