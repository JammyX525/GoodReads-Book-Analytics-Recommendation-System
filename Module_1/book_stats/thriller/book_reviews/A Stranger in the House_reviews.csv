33984056,A Stranger in the House,Kathryn,167,283,1,"July 19, 2017","Let me start this whole she-bang by saying I almost DNFed this book in excess of 10 times. I’ll repeat that statement slower for maximum impact. I. ALMOST. DNFed. THIS. BOOK. TEN. BLOODY. TIMES. For those unfamiliar with my reading habits this is a HUGE deal. Like scream-it-from-the-rooftops level HUGE. I’m a compulsive book finisher. I NEVER DNF. But this book--this book was my everest. After having enjoyed Shari LaPena’s debut novel, The Couple Next Door, I eagerly awaited her next work. But my god. Just…..my. god. There are no words. Nothing to sufficiently articulate the absolute CRAP that is A Stranger in the House. And what I don’t understand is how a writer could seemingly lose all ability to….WRITE. Because it’s not just messy characterization and plot, it’s basic mechanics that are problematic. Fundamental writing rules broken. Repeatedly. Actually not broken, more like blown up, run over, THEN backed over, only to be run over a third time. For good measure. In simpler terms, as a smarter man once said: God may have made the world in 6 days, but while he was chilling on the 7th, satan popped up & produced this. The premise is actually decent: Tom Krupp returns to his picture-perfect, suburban home to find his wife Karen’s mysteriously vanished. Weirder still, their front door is unlocked and Karen’s purse and cell phone left behind. Puzzling….. Shortly thereafter, police officers arrive to inform him that Karen’s been in an accident while driving erratically through “THE. HOOD.” GASP. Tom rushes to the hospital to find Karen alive, but with no memory of the crash or the immediate events prior. How convenient [insert heavy eyeroll]. THEN, a dead body and Karen’s dishwashing gloves (pink, natch) are discovered near the accident site. Evidence accumulates. Surprises are revealed. Marriages ripped apart. Lives torn asunder. Yada, yada, yada.Aside from painfully bad writing, A Stranger in the House features perhaps the single worst literary character: Tom Krupp. And this isn’t a “so-bad-they’re-good” thing. Oh, no. I actually, genuinely wish Tom were a real person just so I could kick him in the balls. What’s worse? Readers are meant to LIKE the man. But HOW I ask you? HOW? He comes home to find his wife missing and his reactions are all self-oriented: “He wanted rather fervently to see his wife…...He pulls his cell phone out of his pants pocket and checks to see if there’s any message from her that he might have missed. Nothing. Now he’s mildly annoyed. She might have told him.” He’s ANNOYED. Not worried. ANNOYED. His wife’s disappeared, left dinner cooking, the door’s unlocked, all her shit is there and his first reaction is annoyance???? Oh, but it gets worse. Tom has all the emotional range and maturity of a gnat. The instant his pristine Stepford life is disrupted, he devolves from loving husband to paranoid adulterer. His self-described (and described and described….FFS, WE GET IT) “perfect marriage” has the slightest bump….and recognize all these events are happening to KAREN, not him….he’s a two-step away from signing divorce papers. “Tom looks back at her, his heart tight. In all the time he’s known her (like 2 years. lbr, tommy-boy), and loved her, he’s never had even the slightest reason to doubt her, about anything. It all comes down to that night. What really happened? Doesn’t he owe her something for those years of complete trust?”YES, TOM. YOU DO. She’s your WIFE. And from all appearances, a damn good one, according to Tom Krupp’s 1950s scale of domestic bliss. Really, this shouldn’t be a question. And yet it continues, a paragraph later he says: “I don’t know Karen. He pauses. ‘I love you. But I’m scared.” DUDE. This is legit the FIRST sign of marital discord and already you’re considering bailing?? Tom continues to suck throughout the remainder of the book with such philosophical gems as: “he loves her, that hasn’t changed. He’s surprised that he can still love her, when he doesn’t trust her.”  AWWW, TOM. YOU DESERVE A MEDAL. Gag. But wanna know the most offensive part (shockingly, not Tom)? The two female leads spend the entirety of the book lusting after the man. After Tom. TOM. Like he’s some prize pig. This condescending, sanctimonious, disloyal, emotionally immature, cowardly nitwit. Ladies: love yourselves. PLEASE. As for the rest of the book? UGH. Nothing interesting happens throughout the bulk of the middle section, character portrayals alternate between soap opera villains and Mary Sues, small, insignificant details were endlessly repeated, ‘show don’t tell’ broken on every. fucking. page, and holy moly: the most stilted dialogue I’ve ever had the displeasure of reading. Leave it to Beaver on STEROIDS. Oh, and every well-worn trope is brought out to play. Can we PLEASE put a kibosh to the amnesia-centric plots? Amnesia isn’t that common. Enough already. This wasn’t a book. It was a Lifetime movie set to page. And a bad one at that.Thank you to netgalley and the publisher for giving me a complimentary, advanced copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.","1,041",304

  I'm not going to write a detailed review. I found this book to be a convoluted mess. The last 3 pages were good. Other than that, I don't have much to say!

I loved the frantic tone that gave me the feeling of being on edge and the super quick pace. Never a boring moment. I carried this book around with me just in case I had a few minutes to get a few pages in!Tom and Karen have a picture perfect life. The are newlyweds with a beautiful home and Tom is a successful accountant. That is until Karen's accident, she has crashed her car into a pole and has no idea why she was frantically speeding through a seedy neighborhood! She is taken to the hospital and now has a concussion and can't remember what or why she was there. The police have questions for her. Hmm.....""If someone has to go to jail--well, that's the way the cookie crumbles."" What??!!Karen is a very detailed person and while she is home recuperating from her injuries, she begins to notice things in her home are misplaced. She knows she didn't leave a glass on the counter. She would never have left her stopper off her perfume and one afternoon she sees the outline of a body on top of her bed. Has someone been laying in her bed??!!Twists galore and some fast turning of pages. I always wanted to get back to reading this one! Lots of fun, quick read, highly entertaining! But that is just my opinion! Loved it!",319,106
33984056,A Stranger in the House,Jaidee ,559,1023,1,"November 24, 2021","1 ""c'est terrible"" star !! 2017 Award - Worst Read of the Year (runner up)  Plastic plot Wooden characters Juvenile writing The Stranger in the House should have a run-in with the Girl on the Train and save us all from these horrible little chick-lit thrillers. Nothing redeeming to say about this except I had to find out how this horrid little book ended. Yuck !",219,58
33984056,A Stranger in the House,Miriam Smith (A Mother’s Musings),"1,478",148,5,"May 22, 2017","I haven't read Shari Lapena's previous novel, the hugely successful ""The Couple Next Door"", so I was looking forward to reading a book by a new author to me and a one that comes highly recommended within my online book circles.""A Stranger In The House"" is a brilliant and intriguing suspense thriller that was so compelling I couldn't put it down - I know it's a cliche - but I found it so easy to read and follow, I just wanted to keep on turning the intriguing and entertaining pages.Karen is preparing tea at home whilst waiting for her husband to come home. This is the last thing she remembers! She wakes up in hospital being told she has just survived a car crash after what looks like she left her house in a blind panic. What caused her to run scared and what could have happened before the car crash that made her to drive so erratically?? The dramatic and exciting start really gets you in the mood for this suspenseful and intriguing thriller with twists and turns and an unexpected ending I really didn't see coming. I'm not too sure whether I truly liked the main characters - bar the determined detectives - the personalities just didn't do it for me, but this certainly didn't matter and bore no importance at all, as I still thoroughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend this riveting book to anyone who loves this particular genre.It's a very competitive business the suspense/mystery thriller market but I believe the author has crafted this perfectly and without a doubt I expect this to be huge in July when it's released. It's very clever, well written, intriguing and suspenseful and has all the trademarks of a massive bestseller - I wish Shari Lapena every success with ""A Stranger In The House"" this year!A fantastic 5 stars!!

33984056,A Stranger in the House,Julie ,"3,989",58900,3,"December 6, 2017","A Stranger in the House by Shari Lapena is a 2017 Pamela Dorman Books publication.Oh dear. Well, this novel is the fourth one I’ve read within a one or two- month span with very similar plot lines. Although, by the time I got this one from the library, I’d grown weary of the repetitiveness, I have to say I enjoyed the quirky atmosphere, and the dash of dark humor thrown into the mix, which was refreshing. Tom and Karen look like the ideal couple. But, their lives rapidly spiral out of control when Karen abruptly leaves the house after receiving a phone call, and winds up crashing her car in a bad neighborhood. The accident causes Karen to suffer memory loss, so she can’t tell anyone what happened or why she was in such dangerous location. To complicate matters, a dead body is discovered near the car crash and it looks as though Karen could know something about the murder, and to top it all off, Karen begins to suspect someone has been in their house, moving little things around and going through her things. With the cops asking pointed questions, Tom and Karen become increasingly paranoid, which puts an enormous strain on their once perfect marriage. Karen finds support from her best friend and neighbor, who keeps a very close eye on Tom and Karen….This story moves along at a brisk pace and has several very nice twists along the way, but it also has one of those annoying tacked on codas I’ve begun to despise. The last sentence was, no doubt, intended to leave the reader feeling a slight shiver down the spine, but honestly, I thought it was wickedly funny. I really did laugh out loud. I can’t go into details, but it was a very fitting conclusion and I would enjoy reading a short epilogue sometime in the future updating us on how the characters are doing. Overall, this book is enjoyable enough, but it might have worked better for me if I wasn’t burned out on the dueling female plotline and those tacky last- minute add-on twists. This will be my last PT for a while. I do enjoy this sub-genre, but the originality is beginning to fade, and the plots are starting to all run together. Time to shuffle around the TBR a little, I think.  3 stars",165,50
33984056,A Stranger in the House,Elyse Walters,"3,846",34900,2,"August 5, 2018","Update.... strange strange strange ... I read strong positive reviews of this book the other day - thought to myself - “oh ... I forgot the author had a 2nd novel that I wanted to read - as “The Couple Next Door” was good with an ending that had me laughing my bazooka- off....So....The library ebook was available: As I started reading - I kept saying “I’ve read this before”... IT WAS SO FAMILIARSTRANGE.... HAD I? YES!!!! It’s rare that I forget about a book that I read.... but what’s interesting is my rating hasn’t changed! I feel the same now as when I wrote my original review. WEAK PLOT - *Still* flat as a pancake..., and the train never came. It’s a closed train station. It’s never coming. Library-ebook: Having enjoyed a great belly laugh at the end of “The Couple Next Door”...really laughing hysterically....not sure it was suppose to be funny or not - but I loved that a book did that to me ....pure fun entertainment—-I kept plowing through this book —hoping for another surprise jolt. Instead of this being a fun train ride with goodies at the last stop —and my surprise ‘jolt’ ....It was like getting notice that the train has been delayed - and I was sitting on the bench waiting - getting restless - a little bored - and sleepy. — but I keep waiting.....(reading). Flat as a pancake is the good news. The entire novel needed a make-over. 1.5 stars",130,40
33984056,A Stranger in the House,Brenda ~Traveling Sisters Book Reviews,755,782,4,"June 6, 2021","Traveling Sister Review by Brenda and LindsayWhat a surprise a Stranger in the House was for us as we were not expecting to like this one as much as we did. I decided to listen to this while Lindsay read it. It’s a great easy one to listen to that didn't require my full attention. A Stranger in the House is an intriguing, easy and fast-paced suspenseful psychological thriller that had us both purely entertained by this fun and easy story. Shari Lapena does a good job creating unlikable characters here. While some seemed not worth liking we were oddly invested in them and changing our minds on how we felt about them throughout the story. Even though none were worth rooting for either, we found ourselves rooting for each at different times. The story is told through the perspective of our three main characters and we enjoyed each one and really felt like we got to know them well. The mystery behind this one had us guessing from start to finish. The shocking twists and turns had us flip-flopping back and forth with whodunit as the suspense built up for us until the final stunning twist that left us gasping and messaging each other as fast as we could. We highly recommend for a fun, nice and easy, purely entertaining story to read or listen to. ",126,49

This was an engrossing and addictive story. There was a lot of hype surrounding this author, Shari Lapena's, well-loved previous novel ""The Couple Next Door"". Going into this one, I wasn't sure how this novel would compare but I actually enjoyed this a little more than her previous book. The suspense had me hooked and turning the pages faster and faster as the story continued on.I had the pleasure of reading this fantastic book with my wonderful ""sister"" Brenda.

33984056,A Stranger in the House,Gary,"2,548",354,4,"August 13, 2017","Once I read the write up for this novel I was hooked and had to know more about it. I though this book was a very good read and the fact that I actually guessed the conclusion for once didn't spoil my enjoyment in the slightest.The lead character Karen is involved in an car accident and wakes up with no memory of what has happened. When Karen's husband arrives home from work he realises there is something wrong, in the kitchen the meal she was preparing is left unfinished and abandoned. Karen's mobile and purse are still in the house but she appears to have left in a hurry.He fears the worse and rings the police only to be told she was involved in an accident in the rough part of town while speeding. This leads to many unanswered questions, why did she leave in a hurry, why was she speeding, where was she going.This all leads to lots of suspense, intrigue and lots of twists and turns. A thoroughly entertaining read.I would like to thank Random House and Net Galley for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.",91,6
33984056,A Stranger in the House,Caro (Bookaria),583,18400,3,"September 19, 2017","This is the story of Karen and Tom Krupp who have been married for about two years. One day Tom returns home from work and finds their home empty, it seems that Karen was making dinner and had to run out of the house in a hurry leaving her purse and cell phone behind. Around the same time Karen wakes up in a hospital after being involved in a car accident that has left her partially amnesiac, what's worse is that she can't remember what happened immediately before the accident.The same day of the accident a man was murdered close to the scene of the car accident which has the police pondering whether the two events are connected. The novel is told from alternating points of view and is set in upstate New York. It is fast-paced and can be considered a psychological thriller. I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed the author's previous novel (The Couple Next Door) because the plot was somewhat predictable and the characterizations seemed to me unrealistic at some points. Also, I could not relate to the characters and found myself annoyed at the decisions they made throughout the novel.Overall, the book was ok. Some people seemed to love it so I recommend it to all lovers of thrillers.",86,19

33984056,A Stranger in the House,Erin ,"1,200",1105,3,"November 19, 2017","A Stranger In The House is a light, quick murder mystery. Not as great as Shari Lapena's first novel The Couple Next Door, the plot wasn't as tight or crisp in this book, but it was still a good and fun if predictable read. The story kept me engrossed and I didn't want to put it down. I'm not giving it 4 stars because the ending left something to be desired. Will there be a sequel? I sure hope so because that ending was not enough.",70,9
33984056,A Stranger in the House,Heidi,"1,012",204,2,"June 8, 2017","The book starts out strong: a man comes home from work to find the house unlocked and his wife’s car gone. The kitchen shows signs of dinner being prepared: a pot of water on the stove, vegetables chopped on the kitchen counter. He calls for his wife but there is no answer. She has left behind her purse and her mobile. Worried, he begins calling her friends, their neighbours, but no one has seen her. Then a policeman knocks on the door .... Lapena really sets the scene here, and I actually had goosebumps visualising it!Unfortunately, from here, the books began nosediving for me, like a shot-down plane on its fiery spiral into the abyss. Perhaps the first warning sign was the main protagonist’s amnesia. Don’t get me wrong, amnesia can be a good tool in a psychological thriller if used the right way. Include a few confusing flashbacks, some conflicting witness stories, some inner turmoil, some suspense. But not on its own, not simply to disguise the plot by throwing the big dark blanket of “I can’t remember” over everything just as an excuse to withhold vital information to the reader that could solve this “mystery” in two minutes flat. A Stranger in the House is a book with very few characters. Tom, Karen and Brigid from next door. And of course the detective, whose name I have already forgotten because for me, he felt like a very forgettable character. There wasn’t a single personality trait to the man that made him stand out from any other run-of-the-mill detective, except that he did not seem to be particularly good at his job. I was surprised to discover that this was the same detective from The Couple Next Door, the author’s debut novel, which I had enjoyed. Anyway, the problem with a very small cast is that unless they are engaging and captivating, the reader soon loses interest. I thought my life was pretty boring, but compared to this little troupe my social life is a downright circus! There are no friends, no family, no work colleagues. And to be totally honest, I hated all three characters. So now we have a problem, because I really didn’t care what happens to any of them, especially Brigid, who seemed so stereotypical that I was wondering at times if the author was writing tongue-in-cheek to throw some wild curveball right at the end. But sadly, no.I am sure that A Stranger in the House will appeal to an audience who is less particular about their fare of “psychological thriller”. The bottom line is – I do want to be thrilled. I want my mind messed with. I want tension, I want suspense. After enjoying The Couple Next Door, it saddens me having to admit that I did not get any of this from A Stranger in the House, even though there were moments when there was real potential for it to become interesting. After having read a few disappointing “psychological thrillers” lately, I believe that I may simply not be the right audience for A Stranger in the House. It may appeal to people who enjoy a quick and undemanding read for the beach or the plane, but for me was lacking in depth and thrills. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram* ",68,9
