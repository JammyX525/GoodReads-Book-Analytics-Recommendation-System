32542,A Time to Kill,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"November 16, 2021","A Time to Kill (Jake Brigance, #1), John GrishamA Time to Kill is a 1988 legal thriller by John Grisham. It was Grisham's first novel. In the small town of Clanton, in fictional Ford County, Mississippi, a ten-year-old African-American girl named Tonya Hailey is viciously raped and beaten by two white supremacists, James ""Pete"" Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. Tonya is later found and rushed to the hospital while Pete and Billy Ray are heard bragging at a roadside bar about their crime. Tonya's distraught and outraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, consults his friend Jake Brigance, a white attorney who had previously represented Hailey's brother, on whether he could get himself acquitted if he killed the two men. Jake tells Carl Lee not to do anything stupid, but admits that if it had been his daughter, he would kill the rapists. Carl Lee is determined to avenge Tonya and, while Pete and Billy Ray are being led into holding after their bond hearing, he kills both men with an M16 rifle.Carl Lee is charged with capital murder. Despite efforts to persuade Carl Lee to retain high-powered attorneys, he elects to be represented by Jake. Helping Jake are two loyal friends, disbarred attorney Lucien Wilbanks and sleazy divorce lawyer Harry Rex Vonner. Later, the team is assisted by liberal law student Ellen Roark, who has prior experience with death penalty cases and offers her services as a temporary clerk pro bono. Ellen appears to be interested in Jake romantically, but the married Jake resists her overtures. The team also receives some illicit behind-the-scenes help from black county sheriff Ozzie Walls, a figure beloved by the black community and also well respected by the white community who upholds the law by arresting Carl Lee but, as the father of two daughters of his own, privately supports Carl Lee and gives him special treatment while in jail and goes out of the way to assist Jake in any way he legally can. Carl Lee is prosecuted by Ford County's corrupt district attorney, Rufus Buckley, who hopes that the case will boost his political career. It is claimed that the judge presiding over Carl Lee's trial, Omar ""Ichabod"" Noose, has been intimidated by local white supremacist elements. This proves true when, despite having no history of racist inclinations in his rulings, Noose refuses Jake's perfectly reasonable request for a change of venue, even though the racial make-up of Ford County virtually guarantees an all-white jury.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: ماه اکتبر سال2001میلادیعنوان: زمانی برای کشتن؛ نویسنده: جان گریشام؛ مترجم هادی عادلپور؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، کوشش، سال1378، در526ص؛ شابک9646636145؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20معنوان: زمانی برای کشتن؛ نویسنده جان گریشام؛ مترجم جواد سید اشرف؛ مشخصات نشر تهران، زرین، سال1378، در640ص؛ شابک9644070178؛ داستان وکیل جوانی به نام «جیک بریگانس» است، که دفاع از یک متهم سیاهپوست، در برابر هیئت منصفه ای سفیدپوست را، بر دوش میگیرد، جریان بسیار پیچیده، اما جذاب و شیرین پیش میرود؛ البته از نظر کسی که به سیستم قضایی آمریکا علاقه هم داشته باشد؛ «زمانی برای کشتن»، نخستین کتاب «جان گریشام»، و گویا نزدیکترین اثر، به شخصیت ایشان باشد؛ «تونیا»، دختر دهساله ی «کارلی هیلی»، کارگر سیاهپوست شهر «فورت کانتی»، برای خرید از خانه خارج می‌شود، ولی دیگر باز نمی‌گردد؛ پس از جستجو، تنها سبد خرید دخترک پیدا می‌شود، و اثری از او نیست، تا اینکه «کارل هیلی»، از «اوزی والز»، کلانتر شهر، یاری می‌خواهد؛ کلانتر نیروهای خود را برای یافتن دخترک به کار می‌گیرد، ولی موفق نمی‌شوند او را بیابند؛ ماهیگیران دخترک را در حالیکه دست و پایش طناب پیچ شده و به شدت مورد آزار و اذیت قرار گرفته، پیدا می‌کنند؛ «تونیا»ی مجروح از دو جوان سفیدپوست و وانتی زردرنگ حرف میزند و...؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 24/10/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 24/08/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",184,1 comment
32542,A Time to Kill,Stephen,"1,517",10800,3,"March 8, 2012","Considered Grisham's best novel by many readers far more perspicacious than moi, this well-written, emotionally-charged thriller certainly delivers. While it doesn't rank as my eye's own personal apple, I can certainly see why it is esteemed by fans of both the legal-thriller and Grisham. Despite being fast-paced and a true page-turner (what I would call a popcorn-read), there's a gravity and social conscience that pervades the story and adds a weight to the narrative. There is depth here, more than I expected. Setting aside for the moment my gripes over some of the language used in the book (one vulgarity in particular), Grisham does a nice job of capturing the setting and providing an authentic feel and voice to his characters. Overall, a satisfying read that held my attention throughout. PLOT SUMMARY:Despite its brisky pace, Grisham’s Mississippi-based legal thriller deals with some tough, serious issues (e.g., race-relations, vigilantism and “justice versus lawful”). The plot centers on the trial of a poor black father who murders the two white shit stains who raped, tortured and brutalized his 10 year-old daughter. The crime and the subsequent trial triggers a firestorm of racial tension as factions on both sides become vocal and volatile. From the opening pages that describe the brutal rape (which was gut-wrenching in the extreme to experience, especially as a dad) through the final reading of the verdict, Grisham drives the narrative effortlessly and keeps the reader hooked and engaged. His story-telling is excellent.  THOUGHTS:However......now that I have both seen the movie version and read the book, my final verdict is that the film is both more enjoyable and the higher quality product of the two. I say this despite the fact that the movie is arguably the “sweatiest” most lathery film in American history and my wife and I crack up about that every time we see it. 
  

  
Those pictures don’t do credit to the muggy, perspiration-overload of the real thing, but if you haven’t seen it, trust me…the movie dripped sudor from every pore like a hooker in church. Words like sheen and glistening are too understated. It was more like the actors showered, got dressed without drying off, walked through a “mister” and then wiped down with a moist towelette before every...single...scene. Now, not everyone was complaining about the drenchiness since it was Matthew McConaughey, Sam “it’s the one that says Bad MF” Jackson, Ashley Judd and Sandra Bullock doing the sweating, but still...hilarious and a bit distracting. BOOK GRIPES:Keep in mind that I liked the book, so my gripes below really point towards why I didn't rate the book higher than 3 stars.1. Too much fluff: When you can take a 528 page book and condense it into a 2+ hour movie that captures perfectly the essence of the story and manages to be even more emotionally powerful, it indicates that the novel was a little thin in the story department. This is the case here. While the expanded story and segues are interesting, the central plot contained too much unnecessariness that could’ve been easily discarded without touching the heart of the story...as the filmmakers did. 2. Excessive use of ""N"" word: Given that the novel is set in 1984, I had a real problem with the significant use of the “N” word* in the story. *(No, South Park fans, I am not referring to “nagger.”). 
  
 Had this been set in the 50’s or 60’s, I would have seen it as a product of the times and swallowed my uncomfortableness. However, it just seems odd that as late as 1984, the word (and the frame of mind that goes with it) would be used so casually and regularly. Given that Grisham is from the South and went to school in Mississippi, he may be spot on with his characterization, and he probably is. If true, this is just very, very sad. Still, its constant use grated on me and I thought the movie did a much better job with the dialogue. This is coming from someone who does not normally favor filtering words through the PC processor. 3. The Main Character: Jake Brigance is not nearly as likeable in the book as he in the movie and I found it hard to engage with him. Now I think we can all agree that Matt McConaughey is not exactly a high level thespian. 
  
However, he did bring the right tone to this role and I found myself comparing the novel’s version unfavorably. 4. The Ending: Again, I liked the movie version so, so, so much better. While the main outcome is the same, I really liked the way the movie handled the climactic closing argument and was disappointed in the novels path to the verdict. I also really enjoyed the last scene in the movie where Jake and his family go to a barbeque at Carl Lee’s house where their two daughters can play. I thought it was perfect. Okay, so enough griping. I thought the book was good. I thought the movie was very good. If you've seen the movie, I don't think you are missing much by skipping the book. However, if you haven't seen the film, I would recommend reading the book first and then watching the adaptation. I think you will enjoy both.3.0 stars. Recommended. ",180,51
32542,A Time to Kill,Tim,"2,084",188,5,"October 19, 2018",This 1988 first Grisham novel is outstanding. 10 of 10 stars!,123,12
32542,A Time to Kill,Matthew,"1,219",8679,4,"April 21, 2020","Original Mid-90s Star Only Review – 5 StarsRe-Read in 2020 Review – 4 StarsYou will notice a drop in the stars above, but you can take that with a grain of salt. It is still a great book that will pull you in and not let go. If you are familiar with Grisham’s work, this is where it all began, and I think some consider it mainly downhill from here. Not necessarily a big downhill – but it sure does seem in some aspects like he was at the top of his game for his first few novels. He mentioned in his forward that this one almost did not get published, but the success of The Firm helped generate interest, and I am very glad it did.This is not an easy book to read, but fiction based on hard truths never is. There is very graphic and shocking sexual assault and racism. So, while they add to a powerful story, some may find it difficult to read. Knowing this, be sure to proceed with caution!The reason for the slight downturn in stars for me is that it just didn’t feel as smooth to me as I remembered. Maybe I was looking at an old favorite through rose-colored glassed before I re-read. The thought that kept going through my head, especially after reading the forward and seeing that it almost didn’t get published, is that it felt like it was a bit rough with a lot of coincidences, drawn out scenes followed by rushed scenes, etc. Nothing that was severe enough t ruin the experience, but enough that it was noticeable to me.If you are a Grisham fan, it is likely that you already read this. If you are a Grisham fan and you haven’t read this, I am actually not really sure you can call yourself a Grisham fan! So, you should remedy that right away!",87,8
32542,A Time to Kill,Fabian {Councillor},229,471,1,"May 6, 2019","""A Time to Kill"" is a riveting story of retribution and justice ... so does the title imply. Replace riveting by frustrating and you know what I felt while reading this doorstopper of a book.On more than 500 pages, John Grisham delves deep into the schemes and entanglements of a trial in the Southern USA. The premise was so interesting that it was impossible not to pick this book up: A ten-year-old girl is raped by two drunken men, and her father takes the law into his own hands by killing the rapists of his daughter. The major problem in this case: The girl and her father are black, and the two rapists are white. If there is one thing Grisham manages to implement perfectly in his story, then it is the exploration of arguments about why the father should be sentenced to death or declared innocent as a result of the circumstances. The reader always bears in his mind how the jury would be reacting in case the roles were reversed - if two black men had raped a white girl of ten years -, but the fact that acquitting the father of his crime would encourage many other people to commit self-administered justice too also needs to be taken into account.Might this premise deliver storytelling material for so many pages? Yes, it might. Only ... it didn't. Shortly after Gary Su Jake Brigance assumed his duty of defending his client, the novel drifted away into long-winded, boring and insignificant rambling. Many people claim this story to be very realistic for how the situation for black people in Mississippi during the 1980's was like. I have never lived there, so I have no idea how real it really was, but the way Jake Brigance acted and behaved definitely did not feel realistic to me. Because who doesn't get royally dunk three days before an important trial? Never before have I been that frustrated by a protagonist who behaved like an asshole towards his wife and just about everyone else he encountered, but was still portrayed like the absolute hero. Throw an incapable prosecutor into the game to make Brigance's light shine even brighter, and you have the perfect Grisham version of Fleming's James Bond.And let's not even address the lack of emotions during the entire novel. You might think that a ten-year-old girl being raped by two drunken men will leave you feeling sorry for her and her family, on the edge of shedding tears? I have to disappoint you, because Grisham's writing deprives every single emotion from every potentially touching scene. You never know how a character feels inside his soul, because Grisham only tells, only allows his reader to guess what his characters might feel at this very moment. 1.5 stars, rounded up due to the interesting premise and the very relevant topic down due to me reconsidering the relevance of the rating system Goodreads suggests (1 star equaling ""didn't like it"").Also, just to clarify things a bit: I didn't dislike the story; the plot was extremely interesting to me and had so much potential, must of which was explored vividly in a very tight and well-structured novel. I also really liked the film adaptation; it may not be a masterpiece, but it's a very well-adapted movie. My main source of frustration is the writing, so in the end I guess I just can't get into John Grisham's writing style, even though I would appreciate the contents of his novels.",74,31
32542,A Time to Kill,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,"1,878",22600,2,"October 2, 2019","2.5 stars. One of my least favorites of Grisham's books, and that's saying something. Actually I kind of liked The Pelican Brief and one or two of his others, but mostly they strike me as mediocre writing combined, more often than not, with pulpit-pounding and breast-beating about some particular legal issue. In this case the setting is a murder trial for a African-American man who gunned down his 10 year old daughter's rapists, who are stereotypical Southern white trash racists who tried to murder this little girl and left her for dead. The legal question is whether jury nullification is sometimes justified, since the father's defense lawyer, Jake Brigance - having no other legal options - is trying to convince the jury to find the father not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Grisham, as par for the course, loads the dice on that issue. (Biggest clue: the KKK getting involved.)I've only read as many of Grisham's books as I have because my father-in-law (another voracious reader) thought that because I was a lawyer I would automatically like Grisham's books, so I regularly received them from him as birthday and Christmas presents. I never had the heart to tell him I'd prefer another author. My FIL is gone now, may he rest in peace, so no more Grisham for me.",50,4
32542,A Time to Kill,Kay ❦,"1,879",582,4,"October 2, 2020","This one was really good. Hard to believe it was John Grisham first novel. This is a legal thriller and much more. The story took place in Mississippi. Two rednecks rape a ten year old black girl. Her father shot them dead in front of the courthouse and Jake Brigance is the criminal defense attorney who represented him. I read Sycamore Row a while back but didn't know it was second in the series. The third book, A Time for Mercy will be released on Oct 13th, 2020.I really like this book although it drags a little at times. Audio was great despite the info said Michael Beck is the narrator I think it was Grover Gardner (The Stand - Stephen King, Andy Carpenter series).",41,3
32542,A Time to Kill,Ruth,64,17,5,"July 10, 2022","Clanton Mississippi, the life of ten year old, African-American, Tonya Hailey has been shattered by James ""Pete"" Willard and Billy Ray Cobb, two white, drunk and remorseless young men. The town which is mostly white reacts with shock and horror at the crime.

For ten days burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire take over the streets of Clanton, as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client's life, and maybe his own as well. I have watched the movie several times and highly recommend both as each will stir up emotions. The book is a great legal thriller and still one of my favorite books. Five big stars. ",40,4
32542,A Time to Kill,Rob,511,103,4,"October 1, 2020","A courtroom thriller published 1989This is John Grisham’s first novel but not his first published.The setting is in Mississippi where, even in 1989, the divide between the white and the black communities was still very obvious. And guess what, here we are 41 years later and what’s changed, not much it would seem.A little ten year old black girl is brutally raped and beaten. She is found and taken to the hospital where the doctors put her back together physically but her emotional condition is not so easily fixed. When the doctors tell the family that she will heal but she will never be able to have children of her own her daddy swears he will make the monsters that did this pay and pay dearly.Two men, both white, are soon caught and charged with the crime. But this is a predominantly white town and the chances that they will get what they deserve is remote.To make sure that justice is truly served Carl Lee, the father, decides to take the law into his own hands and shoot the accused men. This he does and by the time he was finished they were both well and truly dead.Carl Lee is of course charged with murder on two accounts.Enter Jack Brigance, a young white lawyer and the man charged with getting Carl Lee acquitted of the charge of murder.What follows is courtroom thriller with racially fuelled violence from both sides of the racial divide. I enjoyed this book although I found it to be overly long and suffered from a bit too much irrelevant information. But over all an entertaining read.A 4 stars recommendation",38,2

32542,A Time to Kill,Kon R.,219,92,5,"August 22, 2022","What a rollercoaster of a book! Unlike many other courtroom dramas, a lot of the action takes place outside the infamous four walls. At no point did I feel like I was waiting for the court proceedings to start. There was so much going on all times thanks to the KKK. It's scary to think that group had so much power. No race was safe from their fury. The only thing more heated than the KKK opposing the blacks was the rivalry between Jake and the prosecutor. They were both motivated by the possibility of furthering their career by winning the largest case to date. The tension was there all throughout. The judge filled the role of peacemaker and I thought he did a fantastic job with all things considered.",37,4

Hats off to him! A truly heroic lawyer in the image of Atticus Finch.",36,9
32542,A Time to Kill,Brina,873,4,4,"March 30, 2016",Read when it first came out. I really ought to reread this prior to reading Sycamore Row.

32542,A Time to Kill,Paul,164,51,3,"March 7, 2022","Were the '80's really this racist? Well the vernacular of this book is and thus I suspect the state of Mississippi. I looked up racism in Mississippi and apparently it's one of, if not the most racist states in the union if not the most racist place in the entire northern hemisphere. This story makes a huge declaration on the social injustices that are propagated by systemic racism. It is at times difficult to read and the use of the n-word is prevalent throughout the story.The story itself is a typical ""legal thriller"" with the lawyer fighting against great odds, though this one also deals with the KKK and their totally ignorant yet somehow popular attitude in this part of the United States. The story is pretty good though however and unfortunately the character development is not very strong and there are in my opinion, a lot of unanswered situational occurrences which creates a lack of real enthusiasm for these side nuances (sub plots). However, this was john Grisham's first novel so I have to give him credit for that.  3 to 3 1/2stars. ",34,N/A
