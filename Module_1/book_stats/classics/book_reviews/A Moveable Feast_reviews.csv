4631,A Moveable Feast,Lisa,971,3332,5,"October 14, 2017","Loved it!Like Hemingway, I love Paris from the bottom of my heart. And like him, I was lucky enough to spend some time there as a 22-year-old university student. I remember the feeling when I got off the train, knowing I had months of P-A-R-I-S ahead, and how precious each minute felt. I remember walking the streets, stopping to gaze into shop windows, to have coffee, or to browse bookstores. And I remember reading all those wonderful authors who had made Paris their home, feeling connected to them by the location I had chosen for myself. Among them - Hemingway!  If Paris became my moveable feast, something I carry with me to this day, Hemingway became the voice to express that strange kind of love story that exists between human beings and cities. Long after my magical summer in Paris, while I still lived in the heart of Europe, I used to go to Paris at least twice a year, to the spring and the autumn exhibitions in the Grand Palais. I loved the autumn one more than the one in the spring, and there is absolutely nothing comparable to a rainy October day in Paris:""You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintery light. But you knew there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen. When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person died for no reason.""The sadness Hemingway mentions is one of sweetest feelings I know: it encompasses the essence of Paris, - its strange melancholy beauty!It has been two years since I last took my children to the city, and in the growing October darkness, I can feel the longing, the need, the desire to go soon ... I want to take the moveable feast of my memory back to its origin again - and Hemingway will be in my hand luggage!",181,50
4631,A Moveable Feast,Kristi  Siegel,192,575,4,"December 7, 2009","Though often containing gorgeous prose, Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast has a clear agenda. The book treats Hemingway’s life in Paris from 1921 to 1926. Although the book clearly is autobiographical, in the Preface, Hemingway, after explaining that several items were left out of his memoir, then suggests, rather coyly, that “If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction” and adds, “But there is always the chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what has been written as fact.” In essence, Hemingway wants it both ways: the book may be regarded as either fact or fiction. Although there is no reason for readers to read the work as fiction, Hemingway’s suggestion serves two ends. First, Hemingway introduces the idea that the book could be viewed as a novel, an idea that echoes the famous challenge he issued when he wrote The Green Hills of Africa where he ponders whether a work of nonfiction, if written truly enough, could compete with a work of the imagination. Aligning the work with fiction promotes its artistry; in addition, Hemingway’s Preface serves to justify his carefully reconstructed version of his early life.However, Hemingway’s book does not seem like fiction because of what he leaves out, but rather for what he puts in. And, what Hemingway adds is gossip. Rather than the often vain, self-centered, and troubled person that Hemingway was, he presents a smoothed over, patient, loyal, and often loving version of himself. His first wife, Hadley, whom Hemingway unceremoniously dumped for Pauline Pfeiffer, is promoted to near sainthood. Ford Madox Ford is presented as hygienically challenged and a fool, Ezra Pound is a saint, and Ernest Walsh is a posturing liar. Yet, Hemingway presents his gossip artfully, even reluctantly. At one point, in reference to rumors about a writing award in which Ernest Walsh was involved, Hemingway disassociates himself from gossip and even attempts to admonish the reader: “If the news [about the writing award:] was passed around by gossip or rumor, or if it was a matter of personal confidence, cannot be said. Let us hope and believe always that it was completely honorable in every way” (125).Despite Hemingway’s stated qualms about avoiding gossip and upholding honor, he shows no restraint in his portraits of Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Stein is introduced early in the memoir, and then destroyed completely in a later chapter entitled, “A Strange Enough Ending.” Tellingly, Hemingway begins the chapter by observing, “There is not much future in men being friends with great women…and there is usually even less future with truly ambitious women writers” (117). Significantly, Hemingway diminishes Stein’s writing ability by relegating her to a general group of “ambitious women writers.” Hemingway recounts visiting Stein’s house; as he waits for her, he overhears an intimate conversation. Hemingway writes, “…I heard someone speaking to Miss Stein as I had never heard one person speak to another; never, anywhere, ever. Then Miss Stein’s voice came pleading and begging, saying, “Don’t, pussy. Don’t. Don’t, please don’t. I’ll do anything, pussy, but please don’t do it. Please don’t. Please don’t, pussy” (118). Hemingway takes pains to describe how he quietly exits and asks the maidservant to say she had met him in the courtyard, and that he had never entered the house. Nevertheless, Hemingway’s willingness to write the incident and include a private conversation belies the gentlemanly behavior he tries to portray. The intimate conversation Hemingway provides—word-for-word—is designed to make Stein look foolish and weak. Hemingway uses gossip to assert his superiority.Despite the many pages devoted to Gertrude Stein, Hemingway’s portrait of F. Scott Fitzgerald serves as the book’s dramatic core. By the time Hemingway meets Fitzgerald, he has already published This Side of Paradise and had just completed The Great Gatsby. In contrast, Hemingway has not yet been able to write a novel and worries whether he can. When he reads The Great Gatsby, its genius stuns him. Hemingway’s artful vignette of Fitzgerald serves to cut him down to size. Throughout the book, Hemingway carefully constructs his writing persona and implies that the attributes he displays—discipline, diligence, and attention to craft—are the qualities of a true writer. In contrast, Hemingway introduces his portrait of Fitzgerald by implicitly comparing talent with craft. Like Fitzgerald’s physique and character, which Hemingway dissects piece-by-piece, Fitzgerald’s writing ability is portrayed as weak and suspect. Fitzgerald, Hemingway implies, has not earned his ability to write; even worse, Fitzgerald only recognizes his talent after it is gone: “Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and of their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless.” Hemingway implies that Fitzgerald’s writing was not an intellectual, crafted ability, but more a matter of luck. Fitzgerald was given a portion of talent, but he had not worked for it, and it contrasts with the sturdy and true writing that emerges from craft.Not content with rendering Fitzgerald’s writing ability suspect, Hemingway continues to dissect Fitzgerald, taking direct aim at his manhood. Like a good gossip, Hemingway provides salacious details. However, Hemingway packages his gossip carefully. Hemingway writes, artfully: “Scott was a man then who looked like a boy with a face between handsome and pretty. He had very fair wavy hair, a high forehead, excited and friendly eyes and a delicate long-lipped Irish mouth that, on a girl, would have the mouth of a beauty…The mouth worried you until you knew him and then it worried you more.” In the following chapter, “A Matter of Measurements,” Hemingway assuages the insecurity Fitzgerald feels because of a comment Zelda has made by taking Fitzgerald into the men’s room, inspecting him, and pronouncing the size of his penis normal. The content could hardly be more intimate and sensational. Hemingway performs verbal surgery throughout A Moveable Feast, and despite the book’s artistry, Hemingway spares almost no one his scathing memoir.",149,34
4631,A Moveable Feast,Steven Godin,"2,280",2148,5,"March 17, 2022","'We ate well and cheaply and drank well and cheaplyand slept well and warm together and loved each other'I don't quite know why it's taken me so long to get around to reading Hemingway, but that's two brilliant works now in a matter of weeks, after too many years of leaving him distant at the back of my mind. And if I'm honest, I never thought of him as a writer I would even like. How wrong was I. Hemingway wrote this when he was a successful older writer, about the experience of being a young man who was not yet successful, but who was happily writing away and dearly in love with his first wife Hadley. It's all very personal, but in the most generous and rewarding way, and when reading it I never felt like I was observing a person of self-indulgence.As a posthumously published memoir (although it kind of reads like a novel) Hemingway describes the time he spent in Paris after the first world war, and the title - 'A Moveable Feast' feels most appropriate, as it's like moving around in circles during a banquet with a host of bohemian luminaries - Joyce, Pound, Madox Ford, and Scott Fitzgerald were all there living it up there (Fitzgerald features strongly in the book's last third). Not only does Hemingway depict himself surrounded by literary mentors and competitors, some he thinks highly of, some he doesn't, he is careful to record his gastronomic experiences. Food, visual art, alcohol (plenty of that) and racing provide the backbone of this unassuming memoir. Oh, and he was clearly a big fan of Ivan Turgenev, reading him often. His writing style here has exactly the same feel as his fiction: casual and affectionate, always engaging and easy to read, it's deceptive simplicity works a treat. There are lessons in his actual language, which is wonderful, and there are lessons also in the insight into his writer's brain, and the understanding of the fragility of the balance between being able to do it, and not being able to do it. He is writing about the joy of getting it right, with all the unspoken knowledge of the sadness of getting it wrong, both in writing and in life.Hemingway's recollections are at times almost gossipy and he does spring up some surprising sentences, but you never feel too overwhelmed by the high concentration of egos gathered together, sometimes on the same page. We discover that Gertrude Stein was a frequent visitor to the young writer, that he did not get on so well with Ford Madox Ford, and that Ezra Pound always admired the work of his friends. The edition I read was punctuated with photographs, both of the manuscript and of the author and his contemporaries in Paris, including James Joyce and an alcohol infused F Scott Fitzgerald. And by the time we get to Zelda later on, it's quite clear that she also likes the odd drink. Actually when wasn't she drinking. Each chapter is short and vignette-like, comical, sometimes bitchy but always warming. Although I loved the book as a whole, it's especially the last third when in the company of Scott Fitzgerald, and Zelda (who could have been nearing a nervous breakdown) that really pushed me to give this the five star treatment. Considering By 1956 Hemingway was in a terrible state, both mentally and physically he was a wreck, but could still craft writing that is eternal. A Moveable Feast should be seen as the product of a man in terminal decline as much as the triumphant recollection of one beginning to realise his true powers. Except, it doesn't read like that at all. One of the most impressive things about A Moveable Feast is how sure he is, how hopeful it all seems, and how much fun it all is.Even at the end, Hemingway could still do it.",118,28
4631,A Moveable Feast,Luís,"1,791",430,5,"July 21, 2022","Paris is a celebration, a hymn to life, friendship, creation, and a magnificent tribute to Paris.Woody Allen's last film, ""Midnight in Paris"", led me to re-read this excellent author, Ernest Hemingway. Here it is a minor work, but it reveals all the talent of its author.Here he evokes his first stay in Paris in the 1920s, in the company of his first wife, Hadley.That's a financially difficult stay, poor in income but rich in joie de vivre, discoveries, and friendship.We travel through time to discover the nightlife in Paris of the ""Roaring Twenties"". The talks at the Closerie des Lilas, the bustling Gertrude Stein and her shining circle, famous writers like Ezra Pound, James Joyce and Scott Fitzgerald, lesser-known as the Irish poet Ernest Walsh.His friendship with Scott Fitzgerald is a rare friendship that mixes envy, admiration and honesty.The female characters are not left out, and the portrayal of Gertrude Stein and Zelda Fitzgerald is incredibly vivid and endearing. Two ladies with solid consistency, from equal backgrounds, southerner for Zelda, both for Gertrude Stein.An entertaining book that takes us on a journey through time in a fair, excellent company.",96,3
4631,A Moveable Feast,J.L.   Sutton,650,824,4,"May 31, 2016","In A Moveable Feast, Ernest Hemingway presents vivid and interesting observations on his days struggling to make it in post WWI Paris. Interacting with other writers described by Gertrude Stein as being members of the lost generation, A Moveable Feast shows a young Hemingway defining himself as a different kind of writer. The connections to The Sun Also Rises are readily apparent. However, Hemingway’s thoughts about art and his writing are relevant to all his novels and short stories. This is another of my recent Hemingway rereads. It was a memoir I’ve always enjoyed and this time was no exception. ",86,N/A
4631,A Moveable Feast,Matthew Ted,664,543,5,"June 14, 2022","61st book of 2022. 2nd reading. Our very own Ken Craft twisted my arm (hardly) into taking this with me to Paris along with Proust's final volume and I'm glad I did. I read this almost cover-to-cover yesterday on my return journey from Paris, most of it on the Eurostar, a bit more on the train from London and then polished it off this morning. As my 1st reading review suggests, I set out about, several years ago at university, reading an insane amount of Ernest Hemingway. Without hyperbole, I believed my thoughts were starting to sound like his simple declarative sentences. I took a long break. I last read this in 2017 and this was, in fact, my very first Hemingway book. Coming back to it now, having read most of his work, most of the work of those he talks about within, it felt like a different experience. I relished the snippets of Joyce. I remembered the Fitzgerald bits (they are hard not to). I realised that this memoir is the better side of Hemingway, the side that most people don't bother to look for or more aptly, see. He's gentle, he's funny, he's a man who was unbelievably, dauntingly, dedicated to the craft. The portraits within this book of Paris in the 1920s, when he was the same age I am now, twenty-five, are full of regret, nostalgia, pathos; Hemingway is a man who knew his flaws. And of course, reading this on the Eurostar, I was doubled astounded by the images of Paris he creates, because they were so fresh in my own memory; in fact, many of them could well have been my own memories. It is testament to the immortality of Paris. Some of the roads and parks Hemingway mentions are ones I had, less than 24 hours ago, walked myself. On leaving university one piece of advice given by S. (the very lecturer detailed in my first review) was, ""Travel the roads travelled by writers."" In this way, we can feel their presence, perhaps somehow learn from them, feel their lasting power: these were things S. truly believed in; but I could write for too long about that. A wonderful book, Hemingway at his best, and at his best, he's up there with the rest. ________________________1st reading. I read this back in my first year of University for a certain lecture about memoirs and such. I fancied myself top of the class choosing Hemingway. Our professor, Dr H., who is a very good poet (I went to one of his launches and was pleasantly surprised that through his insistent coughing, which none of us could work out, he read very well. I later found that the frequent short coughs he gave were due to a serious amount of smoking in his youth, apparently) asked us all to discuss our chosen books. I spoke about Paris as a setting, the writers Hemingway encounters, Joyce, Fitzgerald, the business with the latter's penis. I told everyone I thought it was very good. At this time I was getting into Hemingway properly for the first time and struck the deal with my housemate, the year later, I think, to read everything Hemingway ever wrote before he read Ulysses. At some point we met with one of our professors, our favourite, Dr S., in a coffee shop and this challenge of ours came out. He told us he had, on getting his job as professor at the university many years ago, left his wife for a weekend and pitched a tent somewhere in the countryside and read Ulysses over two days. He had then packed up and come home again feeling ""ready"". He also admitted that when he had done his own MA he asked if his professor could simply teach him to, ""write like Hemingway"". Since then, I've been surprised to find many people in my creative circles dislike old Hemingway. In fact, if I could distil the opinions I've seen from my own experience they would be this: They don't like Hemingway, they don't bother trying with Joyce and everyone tells them that Fitzgerald is a supreme novelist and they aren't so sure. On my own MA I found a huge abundance of Paul Auster fans, more than anything, oddly. Dr S. laughed at our challenge anyway over his coffee and expressed his joy at such a prospect; he said we were mad, competitive, it was great, he wished us all the best, that reading was the most important thing in life, etc.",77,11
4631,A Moveable Feast,Nat K,400,142,4,"October 7, 2019","""We ate well and cheaply and drank well and cheaply and slept well and warm together and loved each other.""A memoir of Hemingway's time spent as a young, unknown writer in 1920s Paris.This is very sensory based writing. References abound to food and drink and the change of seasons in Paris. You can feel what it's like to be living in poverty as a practically starving artist. And yet there are other ways to be fed. Intellectually and emotionally.Hem talks of the many books he devoured, of viewing paintings by the masters Cezanne, Manet, Monet on a daily basis. The interesting conversations he had with people such as Gertrude Stein & Ford Maddox Ford. His friendships with F Scott Fitzgerald and Ezra Pound. Hem's (first) wife Hadley is by his side, on the periphery, not quite partaking in his literary world and artistic friendships. Yet none of this matters as they are in love. And in Paris.The book is split into vignettes, each one focussed on a different aspect of their life in Paris. There are many caustic observations about his fellow writers and friends. Biting. Undoubtedly they felt likewise toward Hem. He talks openly of their drinking and relationship problems. But what would a memoir be without some good old fashioned sniping.It's interesting to note that while Hem & his inner circle were by and large very poor, they still managed to head out to the local cafe daily and have a drink. Or two. Give or take. I don't recall noticing this the first time around.Is this told with rose-coloured glasses stuck firmly in place? Probably. But then all the best memories are, aren't they.This is my second reading of this book, after a distance of many years. Bookclub was continuing the Hem fest (we'd previously read Paula McLain's ""The Paris Wife""). It still held interest for me. A good book to tuck into when you have an arvo free.""Paris was always worth it and you received return for whatever you brought to it. But this is how Paris was when we were very poor and very happy.""",70,19
4631,A Moveable Feast,Glenn Sumi,404,1493,4,"January 11, 2016","Memoir… or fiction? It doesn’t matter with this amusing classic, a series of poignant and light vignettes about the author’s time as a poor, struggling writer in 1920s Paris.Hem (as people refer to him in the book) offers up clear, unfussy portraits of everyone from salon-mistress/tastemaker Gertrude Stein and Shakespeare & Co’s generous owner, Sylvia Beach, to a snobbish, forgetful Ford Madox Ford and a nasty Wyndham Lewis, whom he compares to “toe-jam.”I especially liked the couple of chapters devoted to fellow expat F. Scott Fitzgerald, including one that tells of a disastrous trip the pair took to retrieve Fitzgerald’s broken-down car in Lyon. It’s in this book that Hem praises Fitzgerald’s innate talent, blames Zelda for ruining that talent and recounts the famous anatomy lesson he gave Fitzgerald at the Louvre, prompted by a catty comment about the man’s genitals by Zelda.There’s lots in here about Hem’s writing practices (he was publishing his first stories and working on The Sun Also Rises), struggling to make rent, gambling, alcohol and what authors he was reading.An air of bittersweet regret hangs over the passages concerning his first wife, Hadley (pictured above), especially near the end when he confesses to an infidelity (to us, not to her).The understatement here, and the book’s lyrical concluding passage, make this a warm, enduring portrait of the artist as a young man. Even if not all of it really happened.",68,18
4631,A Moveable Feast,Annelies,161,3,5,"February 28, 2017","Yes, I know, this is a high rating. But I did really enjoy reading this book. It was like I was with Hemingway in Paris in the twenties. It really came to live before my eyes. I think it has much to to with his manner of writing. Very clear sentences, not a word to much but it captures all he has to say without much frivolity. He wrote this book at the end of his life so he really mastered this very own style of writing and which I like so much.",65,9
4631,A Moveable Feast,Diane,"1,079",2605,4,"August 24, 2013","To paraphrase ol' Hem, ""This is a fine and true book. It is honest and good, and the stories are important and just.""Hem, as I shall forever call him now, wrote this memoir just a few years before he died in 1961. It's about Hem and his first wife, Hadley, when they were young and poor in Paris in the '20s, and Hem would borrow books from the famous Shakespeare & Co. bookstore, and he would go to cafes to write. While there are stories about other writers in Paris at the time -- such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein and Ford Madox Ford -- much of the book is Hem talking about writing itself, which was interesting. He would sometimes worry that he couldn't write anymore and would have to reason with himself:""Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.""My favorite story was a bizarre trip to Lyon that Hem took with Fitzgerald, who drank too much and became convinced that he was dying. There's a funny scene of Hem pretending to take Scott's temperature with a bath thermometer, and then plotting how to get Scott to stop drinking. ""You could not be angry with Scott any more than you could be angry with someone who was crazy, but I was getting angry with myself for having become involved in the whole silliness.""Later, Hem meets Zelda, Scott's unbalanced and demanding wife, and understands why Scott has so much trouble being able to write.Hem also has some amusing stories about Gertrude Stein, with whom he had a prickly friendship: ""There is not much future in men being friends with great women although it can be pleasant enough before it gets better or worse, and there is usually even less future with truly ambitious women writers."" (Having read and not liked Stein's memoir ""The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,"" I say that she was ambitious but not necessarily great.)Overall, I greatly enjoyed spending time with Hem, even though I'm sure some of the stories were exaggerated. In the preface, Hem wrote: ""If the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction. But there is always the chance that such a book of fiction may throw some light on what has been written as fact.""Finally, I want to honor the cleverness of the title, which came from a letter Hem wrote to a friend in 1950: ""If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.""",60,19
4631,A Moveable Feast,Vanessa,459,281,4,"October 11, 2017","Ernest Hemingway. A big name in the literary game. I was always hesitant to read him. Mainly due to his book titles, they never really grabbed me, feeling masculine and daunting. I thought he was a author I would struggle to connect with. How wrong I was. This retrospective memoir of his early writing life in Paris as an expatriate set in the 20’s was a great place to start, getting a good sense of Ernest as a young man before his fame as a well loved author. There’s so much beauty and wonder in the writing. Some of my favourite things to read about are all contained in this book. Paris, books, art and the decadent feasting on a budget all whet my appetite for this book. I felt excited being transported back into that bygone era where Paris becomes the literati playground for indulgence in the pursuit of passion and living the good life despite monetary limitations. It’s a name dropping paradise and I lapped it up. Especially the chapters on his relationship with F. Scott Fitzgerald. I really liked the way he describes the struggles and the distractions during the writing process. Who would have thought that would be so interesting to read about! Even the poverty seems like a minor inconvenience and part of the whimsy! It’s all part of the glittery appeal of a struggling author finding his forte in the city that is the background to so much inspiration for so many artists!",60,25
4631,A Moveable Feast,Eric,566,943,1,"April 24, 2012","I decided to bail after his visit to the indoor bicycle races, like dance marathons one of those frantic displays of recreational endurance so popular in the 1920s. A quick comparing look at Joseph Roth’s account of a night at Berlin’s tracked bicycle races, in What I Saw, convinced me that I was wasting my time with Hemingway. There are better books. Hemingway’s style will always strike me as more or less mannered and ridiculous, but what I read of A Moveable Feast was especially bad—solemn, pompous, dialed down to a portentous slow-mo. It’s enough to make one cite Nabokov’s opinion that Hemingway is essentially a writer for boys. ",58,63
4631,A Moveable Feast,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,3,"September 28, 2018","The Moveable Feast by Ernest Hemingway is an intriguing read.It’s an odd little novel, more biography than fiction. Hemingway recollects his youth, the days where he had no money and lived from story to story before he had his first major novelistic breakthrough. The reader that will take most from this will be one that has read a lot of 20th century literature and is aware of the interactions between writers and the ways in which they supported each other through their careers. Ezra Pound was a central figure who helped form a community of writers and organised donations for T.S Eliot so he could quite his job and write poetry. James Joyce was also important though quite hard to actually talk to (and even find.) Hemingway recollects the conversations he had with such men, and how they helped him hone his craft. More importantly though, Gertrude Stein, writer and homosexuality advocate, was perhaps the one who influenced him most strongly. From reading this, it is clear that she was one of the truest friends Hemmingway ever had. I found the sections with her far more compelling than those with the other literary figures, and I would gladly have read a novel just about their curious friendship. There were some good bits here, though the novel took a repetitive tone as each new section only introduced a new writer and the novel as a whole didn’t feel like it was progressing. The strength of the writing is at its peak when Hemingway describes Paris (where he met Stein.) He creates a vivid picture of a city that he clearly adored, one that shaped him as an individual. Although I had my reservations about this work, I know I must try more of his novels in the future. This may have been a bad place to start (quite a few readers suggest that this is the last novel of his one should read) because it is a retrospective piece about how he became a writer. He is looking back from a place of sucess.",57,6
4631,A Moveable Feast,Carmen,"2,045",1802,4,"March 29, 2016","But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight.Well, this book was amazing. I was rather trepidatious, but it turned out to be excellent.People who interfered with your life always did it for your own good and I figured it out finally that what they wanted was for you to conform completely and never differ from some accepted surface standard and then dissipate the way traveling salesmen would at a convention in every stupid and boreing way there was. They knew nothing of our pleasures nor how much fun it was to be damned to ourselves...(I did not misspell ""boring,"" it's that way in the book.)Ernest Hemingway is writing about himself and his life in Paris. His writing style is so beautiful: simple and straightforward. I really love this style.He discusses other 'big names' he was involved with at this time: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Beach.To my vast surprise, I found Ernest Hemingway to be very funny. He made me laugh numerous times, especially ""Chapter 17: Scott Fitzgerald"" which was HILARIOUS. In this chapter Hemingway describes a trip he took with Scott and Scott is the biggest ninny. Hemingway trying to deal with Scott's idiocy is an absolute riot and I was cracking up. I didn't expect to laugh this much reading a Hemingway book - and that's not the only chapter where Hemingway's sense of humor shines.Hemingway also gets into the most interesting discussions with his friends. He and Stein discuss homosexuality, the differences between gay men and lesbian women, sexual predators, and Stein gives Hemingway sex advice which he proudly brings home to Hadley.Another great chapter is the one where F. Scott Fitzgerald comes to Hemingway, very upset, convinced - absolutely convinced - that he has a tiny penis and no woman (besides Zelda) will ever want him. Who planted this idea in him? Zelda, of course. So Ernest Hemingway is such a good friend and he's like, ""Well, let's check this out."" So he takes a look at Scott's penis and declares it normal. Wow. This is a good friend. Then he takes him to see a Michelangelo exhibit so that Scott can feel better about his penis. I AM NOT MAKING THIS SHIT UP. Lastly, he gives Scott some sex advice on how to make the most use of his penis.One thing I love hearing Hemingway talk about is poverty and hunger. He and Hadley are pretty poor in Paris and Hemingway sometimes lies to his wife and says he's going to eat lunch but instead takes a two-hour walk around the park so that it saves them money. Poverty and hunger are two subjects I am intimately familiar with and I loved hearing about Hemingway's experiences with them.When you are 25 and a natural heavyweight, missing a meal completely makes you very hungry. But it also sharpens all of your perceptions, and I found that many of the people I wrote about had very strong appetites and a great taste and desire for food, and most of them were looking forward to having a drink.This is accurate.One of the most absolutely romantic parts of the book is the chapter in which Hemingway and Hadley decide to wear their hair the exact same length. Hemingway wants to grow out his hair - he so much admires the long hair of the Japanese men he sees. Hadley is so supportive and they make a very romantic vow to wear their hair the same length. This is a very beautiful, romantic and heartwarming chapter. They defy the social conventions of the time:I enjoyed being considered damned and my wife and I enjoyed being considered damned together.Do you know that Hemingway was the creator of the hashtag #sorrynotsorry?I was sorry about this but there was nothing I could do about it. LOL I kid, I kid - but actually I'm not joking, this is Hemingway's attitude about a lot of things.The book is also rife writing advice. I am not a writer! But I think anyone who is a writer would really enjoy and even possibly benefit from reading this book - Hemingway offers some thoughts and suggestions that I could see coming in very handy.Now, the book isn't perfect. Of course we have shades of racism, homophobia, and sexism in here. Not to mention I was getting a strong James-Bond-feeling during a lot of parts:A girl came in the café and sat by herself at a table near the window. She was very pretty with a fresh face as a newly minted coin if they minted coins in smooth flesh with rain-freshened skin, and her hair black as crow's wing and cut sharply and diagonally across her cheek.I looked at her and she disturbed me and made me very excited.Hello, Bond. LOL This is something Bond would think - except Bond would include a detailed description of her breasts. The book also has its dull parts.Anyway, my point is that the book isn't perfect - but it's very good. I highly recommend it, actually. Clear, concise writing. It's funny. It has some great ideas and thoughts in it. I'm not saying Hemingway is a wonderful human being, but his writing is wonderful IMO. It's also fun to see everyone else traipsing around Paris: F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Sylvia Beach, etc. I really was transported to 1920s Paris. I thought this would be boring, and I was happily proven wrong. I will definitely end up reading this a second time, perhaps in Spanish, where it is titled: París era una fiesta Or Paris was a party.P.S. Please note that this is a review of The Restored Edition. I really liked this edition - I've read quotes from the other version and have decided that this is superior.",56,16
4631,A Moveable Feast,Carolyn Marie Castagna,264,5238,5,"July 30, 2020","Hemingway’s true and original foreword to A Moveable Feast: “This book contains material from the remises of my memory and of my heart. Even if the one has been tampered with and the other does not exist.”Ernest Hemingway passed away before he could write a final chapter or even title this book, so it was left up to Mary Hemingway, his fourth wife, to give the book a title. She remembered hearing her husband once say to a friend, “If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man, then wherever you go for the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris is a moveable feast.”After reading that, I could not imagine the book being titled anything else. A “feast” can be an allusion to religious feasts, but it can also be seen as a “feast of life,” as in your supreme happiness. Living your life as if you’re eating a great feast. The term “moveable” is a bit more straightforward; wherever you go, that feeling of “supreme happiness” goes with you. Personally, I’ve been dreaming of traveling to Paris for years. I have also been an admirer of Hemingway’s writing for many years as well. Put both of them together, set during the roaring 20’s, and you’ve got my perfect book! This book truly felt like a moveable feast, literally and figuratively. While reading, I kept having this feeling like I was peeking into the keyhole of a door. That door belonged to Ernest Hemingway, and on the other side I could see the Paris of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, and many more of my literary and artists idols. Sadly, Time itself locked this imaginary door from the inside. Even though I couldn’t walk into the room, I had my ear to the door in such a way that I could hear everything. Ultimately, these words are a portal to Hemingway’s 1920’s Paris disguised as a simple book. As Hemingway says on page 18, “...I entered far into the story and was lost in it.”We as the readers not only get an intimate portrait of Ernest Hemingway himself, but also a select group of people he was in contact with. My personal favorite was discovering how Hemingway viewed his close friendship with F. Scott Fitzgerald. He wrote a preface before one of the chapters about Fitzgerald that says, “His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on butterfly’s wings…” He continues this stunning simile by revealing the wings flaws, and by doing so “Scott’s” own faults. He ends by saying, “He was flying again and I was lucky to meet him just after a good time in his writing if not a good one in his life.” Hemingway even describes reading The Great Gatsby for the first time, and being put off by the cover. On the dust jacket, the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg disturbed him so much he confessed, “I took it off to read the book.” This was one of those moments while reading where I felt like I was peeking through the door’s keyhole. I watched Ernest Hemingway take the dust jacket off and face it down on his table. The most intriguing and heartbreaking aspect of their friendship was discovering, through Hemingway’s eyes, just how much mental suffering Fitzgerald went through. I have always known he was an alcoholic, and his wife Zelda tended to “act out” in a way. Hemingway always suspected it was out of jealousy. These firsthand accounts felt like “Ernest” was telling me the secrets of his friend’s life in ultimate confidence. My favorite aspect of this book was watching “Hem,” as some people call him, go about his everyday life: writing, traveling, walking to cafes… These little snatches of time felt even more personal. He’s bringing us into these scenes to not only tell the story of his life, but also to show us who he truly was. This is one of my favorite lines from the book, “... we would be together and have our books and at night be warm in bed together with the windows open and the stars bright.” From the outside this moment is quite simple, but it’s within the so-called “simple moments” where I find the greatest artistry. Another image that I completely fell in love with was while Hemingway sat writing in a cafe. “...when I sharpened the pencil with a pencil sharpener with the shavings curling into the saucer under my drink.” There really isn’t anything groundbreaking about this scene, but after I read it, I had this overpowering need to paint this image. I could see the saucer in my mind, I pictured it being white with a simple trim, and the beige pencil shavings curled all around the matching white cup holding his “cafe au lait.” This “restored edition” has many alternative endings, because Hemingway kept rewriting it. He passed away before doing any final edits, but his grandson Sean Hemingway picked up the pencil that his grandfather put down. He reworked the original version of A Moveable Feast into its truest form, and I can only imagine how touched Ernest Hemingway would be if he saw his legacy living on. Afterall, Hemingway says on page 22, “I would stand and look out over the roofs of Paris and think, ‘Do not worry. You have always written before and you will write now. All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know.’ So finally I would write one true sentence, and go on from there.” I can’t help but feel that this book in its entirety is the truest sentence Hemingway knew. ",50,1 comment
