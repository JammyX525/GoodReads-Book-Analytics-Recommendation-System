37793,A Dolls House,Lisa,971,3332,5,"July 30, 2017","Ibsen’s famous A Doll’s House is a landmark in the development of truly independent female heroines, rejecting the patriarchy they were socialised to accept unconditionally. Nora, the main character, fails to make her husband understand that their perception of reality is incompatible as he keeps seeing her as a doll, acting out a pretty life for his pleasure and reputation. In the original version, Nora shows the path to independence by opting for the uncertain future of a life lived alone and independently, but Ibsen was confronted with dominant misogyny and power play when German theatres in 1880 asked for “an alternative ending” (yes!), one in which Nora is emotionally blackmailed into staying with her family for the sake of the children. Curtain falls on that “barbaric act of violence”, as Ibsen himself put it when commenting on the ""politically correct"" alternative (http://ibsen.nb.no/id/11111794.0), a rewriting of literature to suit a misogynistic society protective of all documentation of the role of women.Well, unfortunately we are watching an all too real alternative ending to a century of increasing women’s rights at the moment as well. Across the world, ""alternatives"" to freedom of speech, movement, and choice are implemented in “so-called democratic processes”, hijacked by the resurrected mindsets of 19th century white, male, heterosexual, pseudo-Christian figures. Domestic violence, rape culture, law-making against family planning and abortion, the alternatives to women’s rights are scarily real. - Nora, keep walking!",212,15
37793,A Dolls House,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,4,"April 30, 2016","Imagine what it would be like to live in a doll’s house: it's a house in which you are controlled and have no power to make any strong decisions; it's a house in which you are a play thing for someone else’s entertainment. This sounds a lot like a bad marriage, so it's a house in which your husband holds the purse strings, so to speak, and leaves you with no control over your family’s finances. Indeed, your husband keeps you on a very tight leash. Such is the perceived life of Nora Helma.   Yet, this work is in favour of womenNote the word perceived for that is the appearance Nora gives to the outer world. Indeed, the doll’s house is a metaphor for Nora’s life in which she takes on the role of a doll. Her husband is now in charge and before then her farther. She has no idea who, or what, she is because she has been conditioned by society to behave in the manner of an acceptable wife, which is one that obeys her husband’s wishes. The result is a woman who appears week and controllable, but she has kept a big, big, secret from her husband that challenges everything he thinks her to be. She, this simple minded doll, has managed to borrow money (something unheard of for a women of this time) to keep her family afloat whilst her husband was too ill to work. So yeah, this play is very feminist. Ibsen has used Nora’s situation to comment on the ridiculous nature of marriage in the nineteenth century. The play is rooted in the then rising field of naturalism, which endeavoured to portray life accurately with no idealisations; thus, Nora’s marriage can be seen as an accurate portrayal of what most women had to put up with in their marriages. Ibsen shocked his audineceMoreover, this means that the play was an absolute shocker to the Victorian audience. This is not because of Nora’s disobedience, but the way her marriage has been used as a disguise to hide her freedom. Despite being in a controlling marriage she had managed to be able to borrow money off her own accord, by herself. This indicates that Nora’s role as a housewife was nothing more than a charade because she did, in fact, have some freedom to make her own choices such as the life changing one she makes at the end of the play. Thus, the play was a milestone for questioning the traditional view of marriage; it suggested that marriage was overbearing and controlling, but if one was careful they could gain some freedom from their bigoted spouse; it suggested that marriage appeared like a doll’s house in which the doll was destined to be free.

37793,A Dolls House,Tadiana ✩Night Owl☽,"1,878",22600,4,"April 14, 2018","This is the story of a marriage that superficially seems happy, but a critical turn of events reveals a sham relationship.Torvald and Nora Helmer, who've had some financial struggles, are delighted because Torvald has gotten major promotion at the bank where he works. But Nora, behind her lightheartedness and childish behavior - encouraged, always, by Torvald, who calls her diminutive, vaguely (or sometimes explicitly) insulting names names like ""my sweet tooth"" and ""little spendthrift"" - is hiding a major secret. She borrowed a substantial sum of money a few years ago to finance a trip to Italy to help Torvald recover from a major illness. She told Torvald the money was left to her by her father, but it was actually loaned to her by one Nils Krogstad, and she has been slowly paying it back. But now Nils is threatening to tell Nora's husband ... especially since he realized that Nora forged her father's signature as co-signer of the note.I first read this play many years ago as a college English major, and frankly it didn't leave much of an impression on me at the time. But rereading this now, as a married woman with children, the utter wrongness and superficiality of Torvald's and Nora's relationship hits me hard. Almost everything Torvald says to Nora diminishes her as a person:""Now, now, the little lark's wings mustn't droop. Come on, don't be a sulky squirrel."" Nora, in turn, treats her children - especially her daughter - with the same type of carelessness of their value as a person. As the problem of the forged promissory looms closer to disclosure, Nora becomes more frantic. But she still thinks that Torvald, who has shown nothing but disdain for her mind and financial ability, will stand by her and protect her if her misdeed (which was done because of her love and concern for her husband) becomes public.This is one of the earliest feminist works of literature, written in 1879 by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. It's hard to believe that this hard-hitting play, about a woman who realizes she's been treated as a mindless doll all her life by her father and then her husband, and what she decides to do about it, was written over 130 years ago. It raises some important questions of true communication and finding yourself, not just for women but for all people. British actress Hattie Morahan, who played Nora, made some comments about it that really struck me:""... the things Ibsen writes mean it ceases to be about a particular milieu and becomes about marriage (or partnership) and money. These are universal anxieties, and it seems from talking to people that it resonates in the most visceral way, especially if they are or have been in a difficult relationship. Someone said to me the other night, 'That's the play that broke my parents' marriage up.' It shines a very harsh light on the messy heart of relationships, and how difficult it can be to be honest with another human being even if you love them.""https://www.theguardian.com/stage/201.... I'll admit that the ending leaves me unsettled, with its burning all bridges approach. Although I have some sympathy with German actress Hedwig Niemann-Raabe, who famously refused to perform the play unless Ibsen rewrote the ending, I don't think changing it was the right decision from a literary point of view. As a literary work, the ending is tremendously powerful. However, as a practical guide to life, I'm not convinced that what Nora does is right.  She leaves her husband, which I can understand: he's tremendously selfish and has never treated her as anything but a mindless doll. Still, giving him at least a chance to change, once she realizes that they both need that change, would seem like the right thing to do in real life. What bothers me more is Nora also leaving her children and cutting off all communication with them as well, at least until she finds herself as a person. I guess the question for me is, should you hurt innocent people in your quest to go pursue self-fulfillment? Nora, at least, didn't feel like she had a choice, but I wasn't convinced.In any case, this is a very thought-provoking play that's still relevant 137 years after it was written.[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>[""br""]>",98,10
37793,A Dolls House,Chelsea,678,207,1,"November 29, 2007","Mr. S, let me make myself very clear. I will never, never believe that Ibsen intended for Nora's grabbing of her husband's cloak as she ran out the door to indicate his guilt in her implied suicide. It was Christmas. In Norway. The woman was cold.(This is why I didn't do so well in your class, isn't it, Mr. S?)",97,18
37793,A Dolls House,David,161,1410,4,"March 12, 2012","First things first. Nora, the protagonist of Ibsen's A Doll's House, is a twit. There's no getting around it. We may choose to assign blame for her twittishness to her husband, her milieu, or her era, but this will never adequately mitigate her essential twit nature to that reader or spectator of the play who must endure her self-identification as her husband's 'squirrel' or her childlike idiocy. I myself couldn't stop wondering if Nora is an actual twit (i.e., a twit absolutely, regardless of her context) or relative twit (i.e., a woman who seems a twit to us now as a result of the changes in custom, gender roles, and society itself). And I haven't of course ruled out a combination of the two.Then my mind became even more scrupulous. Was my judgment that Nora is a twit itself a condition of my entitled position in a (still) phallocentric society? I'm not kidding. I actually thought this. This is what a culture of loudly warring intellectual discourses does to a man. Am I guilty because I think Nora is twit?Well, I abandoned that idea. Now I am convinced that she really is a twit, but now I ascribe some of her twittishness to the artificiality of drama itself, especially at the end of the nineteenth century. I think I've temporarily settled on this opinion. But ask me tomorrow, and who knows?Since I've spent so much time convicting Nora of being a twit, it might seem surprising that I've given this play four stars. But really—there are plenty of fine stories to be told about twits and their ostensible transformations into non-twits. We shouldn't discriminate against twits. Don't they have hopes, dreams, sorrows, disappointments like the rest of us? A Doll's House is the story of a silly, naive Norwegian wife named Nora who is being blackmailed by an unsavory bank clerk; apparently, she forged a document some time before, but the backstory is too contorted and contrived to bother with here. (I'm more than a little annoyed that Ibsen couldn't come up with a more elegant MacGuffin—one that's not entirely reliant upon Nora's [guileless or stupid, as you see it] admission of wrongdoing to her blackmailer.) Nora works overtime to keep her husband Torvald from finding out about her transgression. (Here, a cultural difference comes into play: given the circumstances, it's difficult for a modern audience to imagine that Torvald would be outraged at her confession.) Eventually, he does find out though and rips Nora a proverbial new one. This leads up to a famous and infamous confrontation between husband and wife punctuated by Nora's door slam heard 'round the world.It's a fascinating and prescient play, no doubt, but it's also more than a little creaky—at least in translation. The conclusion, I think, retains much of its provocation today, well over a hundred years later. It is very difficult to watch or read the play and not react to Nora. She will always be subject to moral condemnation, but she's intriguing—even in her twittishness—because she isn't entirely right or wrong... She's just human. In an often infuriating way.",89,21
37793,A Dolls House,Brina,873,4,5,"June 8, 2016","I read Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House back in high school as required reading but did not grasp the scope of his masterpiece then. Ibsen penned his classic play about the story of Nora and Thorvald Helmer at a time in his life when he was coping with his former love Laura being confined to an insane asylum. In 1872 Laura married a man other than Ibsen and he fell ill with a lethal disease. Their doctors prescribed a southern climate but Laura did not have funds to move her husband to such a climate, so she borrowed the money from a trusting friend. On her return she still did not have the money to cover the loan, so she forged a bank note, which subsequently lead to her entering the asylum. Ibsen started work on A Doll's House shortly after this episode took place. Clearly it is an example of art imitating life as Nora is Laura, Thorvald her husband, et al. What I found the most interesting is Ibsen's view on the place of women in society. He believed that women were not objects who were chained to their husbands with no voice in society. On the contrary I feel he saw women as independent thinkers who were free to make their own decisions rather than the dolls stuck living their lives according to their husbands' wills. We see this with both the characters of Nora and Kristin Linde. I read A Doll's House in less than an hour as the text is less than one hundred pages long. It is what is contained in these pages that packs a punch and why A Doll's House has become timeless. A classic, I recommend to all who haven't read it before. ",89,11
37793,A Dolls House,Lisa,971,3332,5,"September 23, 2020","Let's leave Nora for a second and talk about the tragic figure of Torvald Helmer. It struck me today while rereading The Doll's House that I had completely missed the important statement Ibsen makes on men in patriarchy, blinded as I was by my furious cheering for Nora's emancipation.While following her path to shed the idiocy of her existence as a little pretty plaything, I missed the sad storyline of the little boy who broke his toy because he simply was too ignorant and spoiled to understand how to handle it. Torvald is such a pathetic character, and the saddest part is that he, despite his legal and financial power and freedom, is as much a victim of the patriarchal structure as Nora is, if not even more so... ... because the moment Nora awakened from her society-induced play-acting, she realised what a pitiful little baby Torvald was doomed to stay - a person so unlovable and uninteresting as a partner that the only thing a grownup woman could do when she left was close the door loudly enough for his delusion to break...How is it even possible to love a person who can't see humanity and individuality in his partner? The patriarch is doomed to be unloved and disconnected from his family simply because he is too naive to see what surrounds him and too fragile to accept the realities of life such as they are - unfiltered. He becomes a powerful Family Machine that requires specific handling but remains indifferent and outside human communication and feeling.Once that becomes evident, it sounds more and more bizarre to listen to Torvald's consistent huffing and puffing about Nora's ignorance and helplessness. He's projecting his own immaturity onto her, and when the magic is broken by his inability to cope with life, he blames her for not keeping the delusion intact. Torvald is worse off than Nora. At least she has a life. He only has a few soap bubbles.",61,4
37793,A Dolls House,stephanie,"1,102",378,5,"February 27, 2009","oh, nora. you are much maligned, and yet. i wonder why people find you so much more annoying than emma bovary, etc. i think there's so much about this play as a historical document that i appreciate and enjoy and love that sometimes i forget it's supposed to be a PLAY. that said, i don't think nora was *supposed* to be entirely sympathetic. i think her annoying behaviors are supposed to get on your nerves - but somewhere, i think, Ibsen hoped that you would see the way she acts is not simply who she is, but because of how she is brought up, the situation she is in, the situation women are in, the realities of life for a woman in that time. fascinating, in general, and a true testament to Ibsen that this is even being discussed today. i kind of adore this play, and not because i am a ""feminist"".

37793,A Dolls House,Piyangie,504,360,4,"June 10, 2021","This is a brilliant play by Henrik Ibsen which is also my first introduction to the author. The play mainly revolves around the theme of a woman's place in society as opposed to the woman's right of independence and individuality.Nora Helmer, the main protagonist, has a secret to conceal from her conservative husband. This secret is a cause of action that has been taken by her which is although partly a crime, has been done in good faith and to the advantage of her family at a difficult time. However, when the secret comes out in open, the consequences that follow show the women's position, their vulnerability and men's perception of women in the patriarchal society they live in. This play, to me, is Ibsen's voice which is raised to the world to say that it is time that women are to be looked as individuals, as humans with feelings, and as an important part of a society, especially in a family; it is time that they should be respected as equals; and that they should not be viewed mere possessions to keep and treat as the men fancy. Such a perception on women coming from a man of his era is praiseworthy. It is also a bold venture to write and stage such a play in a conservative society where it is decidedly being viewed as scandalous. Bravo to Ibsen for his brave effort in bringing out the ""women voice"".",50,10
37793,A Dolls House,Helga,814,112,5,"January 3, 2022","“It is so marvelous to live and be happy.”I have a confession to make. I always thought A Doll’s House was a children’s story. How wrong was I! So much to learn…so much to learn…A Doll’s House is a controversial three-act play about the self-discovery of one woman who goes against conventions and rules of a man-made society. Nora is a married woman, who does everything to make her husband and children happy and content. She is supposed to dress up and look pretty. She is referred to by her husband as “my little” this and that. She is the Doll. She has been the Doll in her father’s house and has merely changed one Doll House for another.But Nora has a secret. She has borrowed money from a dubious individual to help pay for improving her husband’s health. She has been economizing and saving money to pay back the debt while being called spendthrift and reckless by her husband. When the secret is disclosed, instead of thanking her, her husband becomes a self-righteous prig and calls her a hypocrite, a liar and a miserable creature and declares her not to be fit to bring up their children.Nora then awakens and makes a decision that changes everything. And her new life begins with the slamming of a door.",47,6
37793,A Dolls House,Carlie,33,25,1,"May 22, 2008","I did not like this book because the main character got on my last nerves. A supposedly intelligent woman pretending to be an idiot to fit her husband's idea of what women are like? And in the end abandons her family. I have no sympathy for characters who punish the innocent children of their idiotic patnerships in order to ""find themselves"". Then again, I read this in high school so perhaps if I reread it I'll see what all the hoopla surrounding it is about.No wonder people hate feminists! If this is what passes for feminist fare, then I don't want to be one anymore. Women don't have to abandon their children to free themselves from this patriarchal society. It only makes you look like a bad selfish mother. A real feminist would not marry an idiot for money not love and produce offspring with him only to scar them for life later by abandoning them.

37793,A Dolls House,Lyn,"1,845",16300,3,"October 22, 2017","A Doll’s House by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen is alike with Ernest Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises in that it may more often than not be misinterpreted. First published in 1879, the play tells the story of Nora Helmer and her marriage to Torvald Helmer. But the play also depicts two other female characters and between the three Ibsen has composed a female triumvirate of the European nineteenth century Everywoman. Along with Nora are Kristine and Anne Marie, who Ibsen has displayed as a female image of subservience, disadvantage and obliging self-sacrifice. But Ibsen’s caricature of Victorian dysfunction does not end with feminism; the male characters are wooden and enslaved to self-deprecating attitudes and behaviors that perpetuate the failures of society and contaminate an already poisonous culture. Most compelling, though, was reading this from the vantage of the twenty-first century. Some ultra-conservatives might share the nineteenth century interpretation of the play (Ibsen was castigated into amending the ending and later regretted the cave-in) but others may fail to see the consequences of the socio-economic results of a feminist movement (of which Ibsen as a modernist was in the far forward vanguard) that has played its part in changing, some for the better and some for the worse, Western civilization. Without a doubt an important drama on the world stage.",41,16
37793,A Dolls House,Liam O'Leary,467,113,5,"January 7, 2021","My 3rd best read of 2020.Video review here (my first video, terribly filmed!)This is the perfect play, and as of 2020 my favourite play of all time. I will thoroughly defend my case below (NO spoilers). Why read?First, as a medium, more than novels or poems, plays must get right to the point. This because it takes a long time to make something happen on a stage. Brushing one's teeth could take more a second to read but a minute to watch in all its complexity on stage. Second, nobody wants to pay to watch someone brushing their teeth. Because of the time constraint of action, plays must be melodramatic to engage the audience to the level required to make a meaningful message (or else the complete opposite i.e. Waiting for Godot). Plays which fail to sustain tension or show action are 'already over', in my opinion, as it limits the seriousness with which I can take their message. A man brushing my teeth or eating a banana can't tell me anything profound I will take seriously, sincerity demands severe context (i.e. Krapp's last tape).Without revealing the plot, I will now propose why The Doll's House is a perfect play. First, it is so, because at all times it makes the audience suspect every single main character could later be dead or a killer. This is the dream of murder mystery novels, but also of plays, as the audience feels like they are investigating a real event rather than a constructed narrative. All three acts occur within the same room, with the same characters, and in immediate succession, which is perfect because the tension never dies and there is no room to breathe. It's also especially effective as everyone's fate is interconnected, and its death for all, not in other plays where dramatic tension is split between affairs, drugs, corruption and bankruptcy. I'm not saying the Doll House doesn't contain any of these, but I think it succeeds many popular plays which instead diffuse tension by changing the scene environment and contrasting character fates which only confused and dilutes the strength of the message. Second, in the opinion of Bill Burr and Ockham's Razor, this play has 'no fat' on it. It's as concise and minimalistic as it needs to be. There is no element of wasted dialogue, there is no distinctive prop, lighting, stage positioning that it needs. It is like a mathematical formula which has been completely simplified, it flows with complexity without hestitation. This is a bold gamble by Ibsen, if the play was anything less than engaging it would fall flat without this. Third, the above points give it a 4* in my opinion, but it became a 5* in its denouement. There really is a point to all this at the end, there is a heartfelt message. Some may pass this off as an average play, and I put this down to hasty reading. I implore you to slowly and carefully read the final Act, and think about how realistic and thematic this is, and then reflect back on what the structure of the play adds to this message.The plotless review ends here, leave and go read it if interested!------------------------SPOILERS BEGINPlot Analysis:Hel. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora [...] But no man would sacrifice his honor for the one he loves.Nora. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.So I've said most of what I want to say, but here are some specifics. I really like this play because I believe it is a realistic portrayal of marital dissolution. What bothers me about conventional theatre is that it is hung up on repeating a structure with Freytag's dramatic arc, and conforming to the comedy vs. tragedy convention. When I see a play that begins without major distasters, I know it's going to be a tragedy and have a punishing ending, and vice-versa for comedy. What's great here is that A Doll's House more resembles a boiling kettle in its dramatic structure, and has the ambivalent denouement that constantly happens in romantic breakups between committed adults in real life. It is unpredictable, but obtains my care for the characters due to their directly expressive nature. Nora and Torvald's discussion touches upon three big aspects — devotion, responsibility and identity — partners need in a serious relationship. Often fictitious narratives oversimplify romantic disputes to single factors, as if it involved lost and uncontrollable teenagers, if only to speed the narrative on past the inability of the author to face the complex task of composing a realistic relationship crisis. Also interesting to me is how the children are never named, they are props, and the main 'skip' between the Acts. In this way we see Nora's disengagement as mother written into the structure, yet disregard it as minimalism due to how intensely focused the rest of the play is. Torvald's hasty condemnation and forgiveness also seems like a realistic depiction of problems men can make in relationships, in incorrectly assuming they should have full responsibility for the stability of the relationship, the union becomes more of Doll House situation, and the Doll doesn't always want to play nice. Another masterful thing about this play is how quickly everything was believably thrown into chaos and back out again. Finally, 'The most wonderful thing of all—' is such an incredibly powerful ending message, it extends to everything.",39,5
37793,A Dolls House,PattyMacDotComma,"1,365",784,4,"December 10, 2018","3.5★“HELMER: ‘You can’t deny it, little Nora, now can you?’ [Putting an arm around her waist] ‘It’s a sweet little bird, but it gets through a terrible amount of money. You wouldn’t believe how much it costs a man when he’s got a little song bird like you!’NORA:  ‘Oh, how can you say that? I really do save all I can.’HELMER [laughing]:‘Yes, that’s very true “all you can”. But the thing is, you CAN'T!’NORA [nodding and smiling happily] ‘Ah, if you only knew what expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.’HELMER: ‘What a funny little thing you are . . .’”Sounds like father and 8-year-old daughter, doesn't it? Would you believe husband and wife, mother of his three children, mistress of their household? This play was written in 1879, and the cloyingly sweet simpering of Nora to try to hide a financial indiscretion from her husband is truly irksome to a reader in the 21st century. But the fact is, there are still relationships like this, and there are still women being reduced to using their “feminine wiles” to coax the “housekeeping money” from the men in their lives.Girls today may find it hard to believe the level of childishness that Nora needs to sink to, but their mothers and grandmothers will certainly be familiar with the scenario. And, of course, little girls still try to wrap daddies around their little fingers! But this is in a class of its own. At one point, the husband says “I shouldn't be a proper man if your feminine helplessness didn't make you twice as attractive to me.” And there's more where that came from. [ACK! Shoot me now.]The play takes place in one room with people and children coming and going, but the crux of the story is about Torvald Helmer having just gained a good position at the bank which is a great relief to the family's finances. Hence, Nora is trying to turn this to her advantage to get a little money out him for Christmas to deal with a problem of her own.How this turns out is more interesting than I thought it might be. She realises she's been nothing more than a doll all her life, first in her father's house, then in her husband's. How that is revealed is in a surprising ending (for the times).Apparently, Ibsen was forced to rewrite that end for a German production, describing it as “an act of barbarous violence against the play.” The irony was not lost on me that Germany was the country that later gave us the two barbaric World Wars, but nobody was to know that then.So I will outline the change under a spoiler in the event that someone doesn't want to know.The play ends with the husband discovering his wife had forged her father's signature on a loan document, so he rants and raves and is ready to throw her to the wolves. When the next letter he opens is the loan document that has been sent back to him with her loan forgiven, he rejoices that he is SAVED, throws it in the fire and wants things to go back the way they were. Suddenly, Nora is just an inexperienced little songbird, after all.Nora says she is leaving, now, in the middle of this night, and she's not taking the children. SHE HAS HAD ENOUGH. It's goodnight and farewell, and off she goes. THE END.The Germans made Ibsen write that her husband makes her look in on her sleeping children before she goes, which causes her to relent and stay with him, because she couldn't bear to leave them. What an awful change! He was a controversial writer and said:“I revel in adverse criticism. . . My enemies have been a great help to me - their attacks have been so vicious that people come flocking to see what all the shouting was about.”It's worth wading through the skylark, songbird language for the story, but I don't think I could sit through a production of it or even the movie.",39,8
