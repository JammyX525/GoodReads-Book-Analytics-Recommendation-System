253984,A Time of Gifts,Kelly,878,3950,5,"August 25, 2011","I’ll have whatever this guy is having. Yeah, the one making the embarrassing noises and eating ambrosia without a care in the world. This ridiculous guy right here. Fermor is kind of my hero. He represents something I've always envied. You know those people who can make a thing, an occasion out of anything, out of doing errands if they must? It’s not just an Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (da da da dah dah da dah da!) thing, it’s a way of not letting a surface presentation of boring be the end of it. Their minds are always working, and can always find something to think about, even at the most mediocre of tourist traps, even at the most average performance of the thousandth rendition of Pachabel’s Canon they’ve been forced to listen to.Fermor is one of these people. I mean, he tries his best to minimize the reality of it, but he walked across the north of Europe in the depression ridden 1930s in the depths of a horrible winter, where snow covered the otherwise picturesque scenery and where Hitler was in charge. He slept in barns covered in ice, had his belongings stolen, had to go door to door peddling his sketching hobby in order to feed himself, and again, need I say it, NAZIS. This trip could have been a nightmare, or he could have sketched it as one. Who would question that in a narrative written about Europe of 1933, with the clouds closing in? But instead of touting himself as a prophet or a self-important chronicler of the troubles of the interwar years, Fermor makes himself a magician. He is the Guide, the Gandalf, the ghosts of Christmas Past, the curator, the Brothers Grimm, the wise child who knows the way through the woods. There is darkness, but it is the kind of darkness that the story needs, a supportive depth that allows us to appreciate the worth of our Guide.Fermor has two gifts that allow him to do this. One is a breathtaking capacity for rapture. I can think of no other word for it. He is able to section off a moment and a place and rope it away from the world and declare it Divine. Guy Gavriel Kay, the great Catholic authors and mystics down the centuries, Woolf in her own way, a few others- there are not so many who know this spell and understand the proper way to recite it. Even fewer of them do not require the assistance of a perfectly staged performance and a Wizard of Oz behind the curtain to achieve it. He’s one of them. What is more, he has so many different kinds of rapture- some that stand apart from the rest in isolated glory, some that last a few paragraphs of a pause, and some that are just phrases woven into a surprisingly colloquial and conversational surrounding tale. He allows his 18 year old self to be excited about some conjecture that perhaps doesn’t seem very important now, and lends his additional forty years of experience to help out.His other great power is a wonderful capacity for digression, footnotes and sidenotes. He has the sort of curiousity that seems to always pay off- adding to his ability to make an occasion out of stopping for lunch. If the trees are boring, well, let’s talk about singing to ourselves in Latin and acting out Henry V on Dutch roads instead, if the German countryside’s rustic Medieval charm cannot be further elaborated upon, why don’t we talk about the Danubian school? First of all, I am jealous that he can do this. Second of all, it is always fascinating. He’s just never, ever at a loss. The depth of knowledge he has to draw on (which, the flattering comparisons to Byronesque behavior aside, prove that books were some of his best friends, no matter what other ones he may have acquired) is just astounding. He couldn’t create the atmosphere he does without formidable ingredients to draw on- luckily he works with only the best. Perhaps this is part of it too- he refuses to descend from the height on which he sits, or to consider a trip to the pub to nudge and wink more than the once or twice he is in the mood for that sort of thing. I got such a sense of Fermor from what he told me on the side, the way that he shaped this story. Which Fermor is of course the question. Sometimes it was old man Fermor shaping the bright young Fermor, at times it seemed like a remnant of the young Fermor broke through the careful old gentleman, whether he wanted him to or not- how artless was it? Was he consciously naïve? Was he overly careful? How much was a portrait of the artist as a young man, and how much was the young man in negatives himself? Of course near the end Fermor gives us a taste of the un-retouched voice of his 18 year old self and leaves us to judge. But perhaps that is merely selective, planted evidence as well. Whatever is the case, Fermor is one of the best artists of the Self that I’ve met, and certainly the one who seems to have worked on it the longest and the most thoroughly. We all of us have many selves on display, and without schizophrenia, it isn’t often that our selves get to talk to each other with an audience around. He makes much of the memories that never were (the landmarks just a few miles out of his way he never knew about, the events he arrived just after or before, the art he did not properly appreciate), which for an narrative about 1930s Europe seems an appropriate topic. It’s almost as if he had such an obligation to make what memories he could burn brightly- because he had been to a nearly fallen Eden that no one could go again. If his constant allusions to fairy tales, the Middle Ages, ancient myth and artwork irritate you somewhat or seem problematically racist/essentialist I would just say that Europe was robbed of a lot of Stories that no one wanted in the 20th century in favor of an attempt to return to Before. In the absence of history, the brightly painted knights and the Vermeer serving girls were what was left that one could talk about in order to attempt to understand why. Imperfect memory robs you, voluntarily or involuntarily.:  “Apart from that glimpse of tramlines and slush, the mists of the Nibelungenlied might have risen from the Rhine bed and enveloped the town; and not only Mainz; the same vapours of oblivion have coiled upstream, enveloping Oppenheim, Worms and Mannheim on their way. I spent a night in each of them and only a few scattered fragments remain:… Lamplight shines through shields of crimson glass patterned with gold crescents and outlined in lead; but the arch that framed them is gone. And there are lost faces: a chimney sweep, a walrus moustache, a girl’s long fair hair under a tam o’shanter. It is like reconstructing a brontosaur from half an eye socket and a basket full of bones.”I mean, this is a travel book. It is firmly and gorgeously grounded in a sense of place. It is, in the end, about walking across Europe and having wacky adventures and picturesque scenes. But it is also about experimenting with literary forms, with the past and with the Self. It is about engaging with a history that was not yet ready to be history, telling friends about wacky adventures, about the power of stories and it is about an 18 year old boy growing up. There’s a gleeful silliness that lurks under some of this, a deadly seriousness to other parts, a winking acknowledgement of melodrama, and a creation of it in successive paragraphs, without breaking a certain kind of consistency. It is a meditation on the role of the storyteller himself. How much of the storyteller is in the story, how much should be there? What would be there anyway, without him, and what needs him to make it real. Some storytellers outshine the story- Fermor is one of these. But I don’t resent him for it. There are a lot of good stories in this book, but in the end, he’s the best one.",295,80
253984,A Time of Gifts,William2,728,2817,4,"October 12, 2021","This is about a European walking tour begun by the author in 1933. He was 18 at the time and his budget was £4 a month, sent poste restant to him along his route. The book’s unusual intellectual depth derives from the fact that he did not write the memoir until much later in life. This first volume, of three, appeared in his 62nd year.Leigh Fermor’s departure from London takes the form of a lengthy description of his steamer, the Stadthouder, pulling away from Irongate Wharf under Tower Bridge on a rainy night. His literary technique here is to slow the moment down through excess description as if to savor it. This is just the first spate of very rich description that one gets throughout. He naps in the pilot house and is in snowy Holland in a blink. Here everything reminds him of Dutch painting. On the third or fourth night he sleeps above a blacksmith's shop. Promptly at six he’s awakened by the clanging hammer, the hiss of hot metal in water, the smell of singeing horn as a horse is shoed. Heading for the German border, he comes across a belfry and, almost reflexively, climbs it:The whole kingdom was revealed. The two great rivers loitered across [the landscape] with their scattering of ships and their barge processions and their tributaries. There were the polders and the dykes and the long willow-bordered canals, the heath and arable and pasture dotted with stationary and expectant cattle, windmills and farms and answering belfries, bare rookeries with their wheeling specks just within earshot and a castle or two, half-concealed among a ruffle of woods. (p.34)His trek across Germany comes at the very start of the Thousand Year Reich. Hitler has been Chancellor just nine months. The people he meets are wonderful. He picks up two fräuleins in Stuttgart--he was strikingly handsome--who don't let him go for days. The parents happen to be away at the time.There's a funny evening when one of the girls must attend a party held by a business associate of her father. The German host is a Nazi and a man of high, conspicuous style. His ghastly modern villa is deprecated at length. Leigh Fermor watches as the host hits on each young woman in turn, cornering them in his study, and is rejected by both. This does nothing for his standing among other guests. (He styles himself the young woman's cousin, named Brown.) His host introduces him around as the ""English globetrotter,"" which PLF resents. Most amusing is their departure. To protect the girls' reputation he must tell the host he's staying at a nearby hotel, when of course he's sleeping on their sofa:We had to take care about conversation because of the chauffeur. A few minutes later, he was opening the door of the car with a flourish of his cockaded cap before the door of the hotel and after fake farewells, I strolled about the hall of the Graf Zeppelin for a last puff on the ogre [his host's] cigar. When the coast was clear I hared through the streets and into the lift and up to the flat. They were waiting with the door open and we burst into a dance. (p. 80)Then he's in Bavaria wrestling strapping peasants on beer hall floors for fun, losing his precious notebook, his walking stick, and waking ""catatonic"" with hangover, or, as it's called in Germany, katzenjammer. The holidays pass and on 11 February 1934 he turns 19. He undertakes a recapitulation of his reading at the time, much of it Latin and Greek, which left me envious of his failed classical education. Though he was a terrible student — a scrapper and practical joker it seems — he ended up a formidable linguist, who, only a few years later during the war, along with his unit--he was in uniform by then--successfully kidnapped a German general in Crete. This would make him a national war hero, but I rush ahead.In Austria, as in Germany, he has occasion, between his nights in peasants’ stables and hutches, to find himself lodged amid extraordinary grandeur. He had the foresight to arrange a number of introductions on the continent. In Austria he fetches up at the schloss of K.u.K. Kämmerer u. Rittmeister i.R., Count Gräfin of the late dual monarchy. The count was old and frail. He resembled, a little, Max Beerbohm in later life, with a touch of Franz Joseph minus the white side-whiskers. I admired his attire, the soft buckskin knee-breeches and gleaming brogues and a gray and green loden jacket with horn buttons and green lapels. These were accompanied out-of-doors by the green felt hat with its curling blackcock's tail-feather which I had seen among a score of walking sticks in the hall. (p. 137)We move on to an assessment of the quintessential Austrian schloss. Its myriad details are considered, as well as certain regional variations. The disquisition on German painting (Cranach, Bruegel, Altsdorfer, Dürer, etc.) has the righteous authoritative tone of Robert Hughes. Especially interesting is the author’s point about the lush technique of the Italian Renaissance hardening into a grotesque and visceral style in the north due to the brutal wars of the period. (See C.V. Wedgwood's fine The Thirty Years War which he extols in a note.). We also get details of the Danube's history, its flora and fauna (including a predacious 15-foot catfish known as the Wels). The author's not infrequent late nights at the various inns along the way are colorful. The one five miles from Ybbs ""was made of wood, leather or horn and the chandelier was an interlock of antlers.""A tireless accordionist accompanied the singing and through the thickening haze of wine, even the soppiest songs sounded charming: 'Sag beim Abschied leise ""Servus,""' 'Adieu, mein kleiner Gardeoffizier,' and 'In einer kleinen Konditorei.' . . . The one I liked most was the Andreas-Hofer-Lied, a moving lament for the great mountain leader of the Tyrolese against Napoleon's armies, executed in Mantua and mourned ever since. (p. 170)The section on the migrations of peoples I found particularly dense. One thing you have to say for PLF, he does not write down to his reader. He assumes you have much the same knowledge or educational grounding as he does, and for those of his generation this was by and large true. Always hovering is the horror of the Holocaust to come. It's 1934 after all. But it's not until he enters Köbölkut in the marches of Hungary, and finds himself among the roughhewn peasantry in a local church on Maunday Thursday, listening to the Tenebrae, then, in search of a bed for the night, when he finds himself talking to the local Jewish baker, that the weight of the inevitable hits the reader and the effect is is one of deep dread.The church had lost its tenebrous mystery. But, by the end of the service a compelling aura of extinction, emptiness and shrouded symbols pervaded the building. It spread through the village and over the surrounding fields. I could feel it even after Köbölkut had fallen below the horizon. The atmosphere of desolation carries far beyond the range of a tolling bell. (p. 299)I gave the book four stars because the style is very dense and I never quite acclimated to it. I find PLF here at times too humorless and didactic. There's a smell of the lamp, true, but there’s also much that’s wonderful. He's clearly drunk on the history of the Danube basin and he has a gift for making languages interesting on the page even for those who do not speak them. That cannot have been an easy task, but he does it. Particularly interesting was how one almost watches him pick up German, writing about the change of dialects along the way. There’s so much more I’m not touching on. Bratislava and his friend there, Hans, the banker; the last-minute train trip with Hans to Prague in the snow, a backtrack to the only city on his 2000-plus mile route he does not enter on foot; his discussion the following morning with the Jewish baker's Hasidic heritage; the time he's held at gunpoint on the Austria-Czech border when he's thought to be a smuggler; his contemplative loitering on the bridge between Slovakia and Hungary, the Basilica of Esztergom looming overhead, the Danube rushing below.But for all it’s verbal richness A Time of Gifts can be at times a bit of a slog. One never careers happily through it. One is always aware of the great erudition, the trumping vocabulary, etc. It is in the end like a cloying, too rich desert. If you’re inclined to indulge, as many will be, (for the book is very highly regarded), so much the better for you.",133,23
253984,A Time of Gifts,Adam Floridia,582,30,4,"January 25, 2012","This book will forever hold a special place in my heart because it is the first one my son, Jameson Michael Floridia (Jem for short), read: Actually, it was more like this:Hopefully, some of Fermor's aesthetically magnificent, dazzling images will dance like sugar plums in his little head. Maybe one day he will be a Wandering Scholar...Hopefully, Konrad's words will reside latent in his subconscious: ""'You see, dear young, how boldness is always prospering?'"" (205).Hopefully (but not likely), I will be able to restrain my new-fatherhood joy and not include him in every subsequent review...but one more for the road:""He saw himself as a Wandering Scholar. He was alone, and he was ready to sleep anywhere, talk to anybody, live on almost nothing, eat or drink anything, have a go at any language, make friends with rich or poor, and brave the worst that heat and cold, mishap and blister, officialdom, prejudice and politics could do to him"" (intro).

253984,A Time of Gifts,Paul,"1,144",1908,5,"July 17, 2018","This is a remarkable book; the account of an 18 year old who decides to escape England and walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople. The year is 1933 and the Nazis have just come to power and he sets off just before winter starts. He had been expelled from school and wanted to write and he took writing materials with him to record his experiences in a journal/diary. Leigh Fermor has the optimism and enthusiasm of youth; but he also had good powers of observation and the ability to make friends easily. That he must have had a great deal of as many people put him up overnight without question. This first of three volumes starts in Holland and moves through Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and ends in Hungary.The book captures a world about to be torn apart by the rise of Nazism and Leigh Fermor comes across them and they are generally unpleasant; in contrast with most of those he meets. He goes off on tangents on a regular basis to describe something interesting. His descriptions of the natural world are very good, especially the arrival of the storks in the spring in Hungary. Leigh Fermor also has a good eye for architecture and notes the changing nature of the buildings as he travels. He describes the people he meets, the generosity, and often in detail the food (and the drink). Laced through it all is Leigh Fermor’s love of literature and reading. Having had a public school education he has able to quote a great deal of what he had been taught. He records the amused reactions of people as he walked and acted out bits of Shakespeare or read poems and other bits and pieces that he recalled. It is a coming of age tale like no other and he maintained his zest for life until the end. The journalist Allison Pearson recalls when she was sent to Crete to meet him when he was 83 to write an article on him. She expected a frail old man she would have to “look after”. She just about remembers drinking more in 48 hours than she had for the previous 20 years and waking up under a bar. Pearson says that as they walked around Crete she could barely keep up with him and he was very much like he was in the book; observant of nature, breaking into song and poetry periodically and climbing things.The sheer zest for life is infectious and the descriptions very sharp, for example; “Snow had covered the landscape with a sparkling layer and the slatey hue of the ice was only becoming visible as the looping arabesques of the skaters laid it bare. Following the white parallelograms the lines of the willows dwindled as insubstantially as trails of vapour. The breeze that impelled those hastening clouds had met no hindrance for a thousand miles and a traveller moving at a footpace along the hog’s back of a dyke above the cloud-shadows and the level champaign was filled with intimations of limitless space..”This is one of the great travel books.",65,7
253984,A Time of Gifts,David,161,1410,1,"September 7, 2011","Now I fully realize that I have no right to ‘review’ a book of which I’ve read only about forty miserable pages, plus its bloviating introduction. So if you’re a militant Fermor partisan and you’ve arrived here for the purpose of throwing fits and tantrums and tsk-tsking me for bad protocol, then save the exertion of your typing fingers. I’m unmoved by the natural law of book reviewing or its radical adherents. Now where’s my soapbox? This book is the opposite of the kind of books I enjoy. It’s windy, self-satisfied, lifeless, and dry—something you imagine might easily have been written in the pleasureless Age of Hegel. But no. This was actually the 1970s. The era of Three’s Company and Minnie Riperton. So why does this dude sound like he just rode in on a hansom cab from the Congress of Vienna? Seriously. We get it. You’re really, really, really smart and you know a whole bunch of archaic and rarely-used words, and therefore we should feel as if we have somehow failed you if we don’t appreciate your masturbatory wordiness for the poetry it is. But it really isn’t. Poetry, I mean. It’s a gratuitous and bloated travelogue that makes Proust look like Vanna White’s autobiography. Where was the editor here? I’m worried that he scarfed down some hemlock when he got to page ten, never to red pencil a text again. But a lot pretentious American intellectual-aspirants will really eat this stuff up for varied and complex sociological reasons. First of all, it’s painfully British. That’s shorthand in America for classy. You could recast Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen with Jeremy Northam, Kiera Knightley, and Alan Rickman, and they’d be falling all over their tins of Earl Grey to get to the cineplex. Secondly, the English major types are often aesthetically conservative. They won’t celebrate DeLillo or Pynchon for another hundred years, until they’ve been fully vetted by history. Besides, who needs experimentation when you’ve got people like Fermor still writing in that old starchy anachronistic style that makes the Anglophiles sink a little deeper into their imported Fair Isle sweaters? Well, actually… you don’t have Fermor anymore. He died earlier this year. And while I’m not happy about anybody’s death, I’m certainly not mournful that he can’t churn out any more books. Forty pages (plus introduction) was more than enough to know that I hated this book with the white-hot heat of a thousand suns. And I want it to be gone, away from me. So if this sounds appealing to you, I’d be happy to send it to you free-of-charge if you’re on my friend list. Along with my pity. (The first friend who asks for it in the public comments below gets it. And after a sales pitch like this, how can you say no?)",64,32
253984,A Time of Gifts,Geoff,444,1161,5,"September 15, 2011","To enjoy A Time of Gifts you will only need to possess an interest (even a passing interest) in at least one of these three things: the English language, descriptions of land and city-scapes, and the history of European art and culture. Is that more than three things? Possibly. This is certainly the most erudite travel book I have ever read. It is composed of countless magnificent words. I understand this is the case with many books. But this one is a really vivid fabric, each word representing a micro-filament that commands its due attention from the gaze as it passes over the length and folds of this textile work. Each little strand supports its successor and predecessor, and each one shines on its own in the field. I would like for someone (not myself) to attempt an individual word count for this book. The language is almost overflowing its capacity. I learned a great deal just looking up the architectural or religious words and phrasings I did not know; I was mystified by the place-names once he dropped from the Rhine and picked up his pace along the Danube and into the Slavic countries. Fermor's love of and aptitude for languages is one of the pleasures of this work. As he crosses each frontier a new dialect, odd stresses on syllables and deviant pronunciations fascinate him and he will go on extrapolating theories as to their origin and historic context. It's the same when he reads the land, his eye is always looking for connections. His verbose landscape paintings are head-rushes, dizzying flights of prose composed of minute observations of the details of meadows, sunrises and sunsets, snow-dappled limbs, light on frozen rivers, buds emerging from wet bows, dark and constellation-domed forests. It's sometimes a bit much and I reread many sections trying to assimilate it all. But Fermor really gets going when he is in his favorite environs; the Schlossen, the abbeys, the castles and monasteries and libraries that punctuate his trip across Middle Europe. An example of his descriptive prolixity (in the abbey at Melk):...rococo flowers into miraculously imaginative and convincing stage scenery. A brilliant array of skills, which touches everything from the pillars of the colonnade to the twirl of a latch, links the most brittle and transient-seeming details to the most magnificent and enduring spoils of the forests and quarries. A versatile genius sends volley after volley of fantastic afterthoughts through the great Vitruvian and Palladian structures. Concave and convex uncoil and pursue each other across the pilasters in ferny arabesques, liquid notions ripple, waterfalls running silver and blue drop to lintels and hang frozen there in curtains of artificial icicles. Ideas go feathering up in mock fountains and float away through the colonnades in processions of cumulus and cirrus. Light is distributed operatically and skies open in a new change of gravity that has lifted wingless saints and evangelists on journeys of aspiration towards three-dimensional sunbursts and left them levitated there, floating among cornices and spandrels and acanthus leaves and architectural ribands crinkled still with pleats from lying long folded in bandboxes...It goes on. With A Time of Gifts, Fermor has kind of entered my pantheon of personal heroes. Why? I'll tell ya. Of course his capacious intellect, his effortless recitation of obscure and fascinating points in Middle European history connected to his travels (his obsession with the Thirty Years War colors this travelogue in a similar way that Rilke's Brigge Notebooks are colored by his obsession with the deaths of French kings), his open-mindedness and ability to communicate and find commonality with practically anyone, despite barriers of language and culture; all these things, yes, but also because the guy had balls. Balls and intellect (the keys to success). At age 18, finding himself kicked out of school and wanting to become a writer, he set off to walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople, following two of Europe's most significant rivers. He was met with kindness and generosity, even crossing Hitler's Germany, and there is a gray tint that falls over some of this book when he reflects that within a decade certain quarters he had haunted would be bombed into nonexistence. I suppose that is what this book is, the experiences of a young man instilled with a good dose of that youthful confidence that persuades one that anything is possible, who sets out across a European continent he obviously adores to set it down in a loving portrait, one last time, before it all went to pieces.",57,8

253984,A Time of Gifts,Lorna,629,339,4,"May 7, 2021","A Time of Gifts is a lovely book that may be described as a memoir, a travel book, a biography, or a European history book by Patrick Leigh Fermor. It was not published until 1977 when he was sixty-two years old even though the travels and the diary of the events was written in the 1930s during the rise of Adolf Hitler when Fermor was only eighteen-years old. This young man was determined to drop out of school and travel. I thought that one of the most beautiful parts of this book was the final blessing by his mother in writing the translation of a short poem by Petronius on the flyleaf of the Loeb Horace, Vol. I, as follows:
   ""Leave thy home, O youth, and seek out alien shores. . . . Yield not to misfortune: the far-off Danube shall know thee, the cold North-wind and the untroubled kingdom of Canopus and the men who gaze upon the new birth of Phoebus or upon his setting. . . ""
So in 1933 as Adolf Hitler is beginning to rise to power, Patrick Leigh Fermor set out on foot with only a rucksack, a passport and a few favorite books, to explore Europe beginning in Holland with his ultimate destination being Constantinople. A Time of Gifts is the first in this trilogy that defies categorization taking young Fermor from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople. This particular book ends as he enters Hungary.. His experiences are both personal and regional as we find ourselves immersed in his travels. One of our favorite trips to Europe was a river cruise on the Danube River and this book was so reminiscent of all of those beautiful cities that we were able to visit along the way, including Bratislava, Prague and Vienna. ""Wandering along the river's bank just before sunset, I felt I would like to settle and write here for ages. Mediating, admonishing and blessing, a team of sainted and weather-fretted Abbots postured with operatic benignity along the Canons' balustrade. Their halos were dripping with icicles; snow had filled the clefs of their mitres and furred the curls of their pastoral staves."" I must thank my friend, Julie. She recommended that I read Between the Woods and the Water: On Foot to Constantinople: From the Middle Danube to the Iron Gates. That is next on my list, but Julie you had to know that I would have to read the entire trilogy. Thank you my friend, it is delightful.",33,10
253984,A Time of Gifts,Rebecca,"3,508",2506,5,"September 12, 2016","A true masterwork of travel writing. So much is impressive about this book, starting with Fermor’s journey itself. Over the course of three years, starting when he was just 18, he walked from Holland to Constantinople. I was particularly eager to read this because he passes through a lot of places I went on my train travels this past summer, including Germany, Austria and Bratislava. This first of three volumes covers up until his entry into Hungary.The sharpness of memory is astonishing, especially when you learn that Fermor lost two of the journals he kept along the way; a late section intersperses a few recovered journal entries with the narrative, and there’s scarcely any difference in terms of detail. His descriptions of the landscape and the people he interacted with are as fresh as if they happened yesterday, and yet he was reconstructing this journey nearly 40 years after the fact.Although he was in a sense travelling rough – he took very little with him, was often worried about money, and pretended to be a student, an assumed identity that proved to be “an amulet and an Open Sesame” – he also managed to wangle invitations into castles and aristocrats’ homes. For every night he had to sleep in a barn or on a pub floor, there was a stay of comfort or even opulence. This gives him such a broad base of observation that you feel you’re getting a complete picture of European life in the early 1930s. It’s a precious glimpse of pre-war history, but even though he’s looking back Fermor doesn’t use too heavy a hand when recalling the signs of rising Nazism.Lastly, this is simply damn fine writing. I marked so many gorgeous passages; here are just a few that helped me absorb the atmosphere:Beer, caraway seed, beeswax, coffee, pine-logs and melting snow combined with the smoke of thick, short cigars in a benign aroma across which every so often the ghost of sauerkraut would float.The Romanesque nave was packed and an anthem of great choral splendour rose from the gothic choir stalls, while the cauliflowering incense followed the plainsong across the slopes of the sunbeams.When no buildings were in sight, I was back in the Dark Ages. But the moment a farmhouse or a village impinged, I was in the world of Peter Brueghel.[Bought from £1 from a secondhand bookstore in Henley-on-Thames.]",32,6

253984,A Time of Gifts,Numidica,354,8,5,"November 16, 2022","A Time of Gifts is a book I’d been meaning to read since about 1999. I can’t remember who recommended it to me, but I do recall it being mentioned in The Common Reader catalog (sadly defunct) along with Ill Met by Moonlight, a book about the incredible (and successful) mission to kidnap the commanding general of German forces in Crete during WW2. That book was written by W. Stanley Moss, Patrick Fermor’s second in command on that operation, and Fermor was said to have been irritated by the book, because it seemed a bit too much like boasting for his taste. Patrick Leigh Fermor was almost the same age as my father, with similar tastes in literature, so perhaps I feel I know him a little (and by the way, the reason I am not approaching eighty years old with a father who was born during WW1 is that I arrived on the scene when my dad was in his late 40’s). The only book Fermor says he carried with him on his walk across Europe was the Oxford Book of English Verse, a book which Dad always had at hand. Fermor was educated (until he was thrown out of school) in the pre-war tradition of the Western Canon, and his walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople was informed by that education almost every step of the way. There is no better advertisement for how a liberal arts education enhances one’s experience of life than Fermor’s commentary on each new city or castle he encountered and how it figured in art or history, and I humbly say that as a graduated engineer with a minor in mathematics. Fermor knew French, but he chose a route that avoided French-speaking areas so that he would be forced to learn at least German (which he did), and other languages as well, though he mastered none as well as German. He later became, famously, a scholar of modern and ancient Greek, but that part of his life is not dealt with in A Time of Gifts. Aside from being a wonderful, rambling, anecdotal education in European history (at least for me), Fermor’s book is full of happy stories, which glow brighter in the retelling because they are true. Fermor wandered across Europe at a particular time in history when the fallen kingdoms and empires of old Europe were not long in their graves, and members of the aristocracy, still in their 40’s and 50’s, could recount tales of formal dinners with the King of Saxony, or having met the Emperor Franz Josef. Indeed, Fermor’s travels were fortuitously redirected by a meeting with a Count in Germany who took a shine to young Patrick; the Count then wrote letters of introduction for Fermor to all his relatives and aristocratic friends along the route of Patrick’s path to the Bosporus. This resulted in a strange dichotomy, as Fermor said, whereby for every two nights he spent sleeping in a barn or a field, he spent one night in a “schloss”, i.e., “castle” in English, though the term can denote something a good deal less grand in German, such as a well-appointed country home. Fermor’s travels in Germany in 1933-4 are also interesting because they sometimes foreshadowed the Gotterdammerung to come. He met many educated Germans who could hardly believe that Hitler was really Reichs Chancellor, and who thought that he wouldn’t last. But over and over, he met working-class people who supported Hitler because Hitler seemed to be doing something to stabilize the economy, or simply because he seemed a strong, focused leader. Well, I suppose he was that. But also, the kleptocratic element of National Socialism was illustrated by Fermor’s platonic sojourn with two delightful students in Stuttgart, during which they took him to dinner with them at a “big Nazi’s” home. This Nazi fellow was a creep, but also a successful industrialist, thanks in part to his Nazi connections; the girls wanted Patrick along with them in part because they knew the middle-aged businessman would attempt to get handsy. Later, one of the aristocrats who entertained Fermor in Vienna who was about his age became a good friend; later still, fighting the Wehrmacht in Crete, Fermor learned through captured documents that his friend was a Hauptmann fighting on the opposite side of the line, so Fermor managed to move his unit to the right flank of his division in order not to be in the position of firing on his friend. Fermor’s reflections on literature and history are guides for me for future reading, and some of his various commentaries have already led me to read (God bless Wikipedia) many great stories of which I was unaware, such as the death of blind King John of Bohemia in battle at Crecy, and the honor done him posthumously by the Prince of Wales (The Black Prince). The level of cultural knowledge to which Fermor’s supremely active mind gave harbor is amazing; the fact that he combined such knowledge with a light-hearted love of life is uplifting. From what I can learn, Fermor was one of those people who was, if not the life of the party, then at least always welcome for his witty conversation and curiosity about everything. And to top it all off, he was fearless. A final note about this trip of his: from Holland to Hungary, traveling with little or no money, he never found himself in any real danger, and he was treated with incredible hospitality so many times that it was more the norm than something to remark upon. And yet, Fermor looked back at all those helpful inn-keepers and burgomeisters with gratitude, and he never took for granted the kindness of strangers, no matter how commonly it befell him. I have had similar experiences in Germany and France; I remember riding in the back of a truck in Germany in chilly September, and a farmer tossing me a ripe apple with a smile, and a French woman correcting my French, and then giving me free admission to an event, because I had tried to speak her language, or a Forstmeister explaining the growth of beech trees, and then beaming at me because I was truly interested. Fermor knew that one does well to be good and trust in others rather than to fear. Trust is usually returned with interest.My only quibble with the book is that Fermor loved to talk architecture (what was he not interested in?), and I have little interest in the subject, especially baroque architecture, which is what ones sees a lot of along the Danube. But that’s a minor reservation. As a travelogue, this book has few if any peers in my experience. Highly recommended, and damn it, why did no one tell me thirty years ago that I should travel to Greece, when Fermor was still alive, and buy him a drink and listen to him tell stories?",30,12
253984,A Time of Gifts,Eric,566,943,5,"June 3, 2010","Ah, these English travellers and their amazing prose--prose equal, fitted to their feats. Virginia Woolf on Hakluyt's Early Voyages:These magnificent volumes are not often, perhaps, read through. Part of their charm consists in the fact that Hakluyt is not so much a book as a great bundle of commodities loosely tied together, an emporium, a lumber room strewn with ancient sacks, obsolete nautical instruments, huge bales of wool, and little bags of rubies and emeralds. One is for ever untying this packet here, sampling that heap over there, wiping the dust off some vast map of the world, and sitting down in semi-darkness to snuff the strange smells of silks and leathers and ambergris, while outside tumble the huge waves of the uncharted Elizabethan sea.During 1933-35, the eighteen year old Patrick Leigh Fermor, recently expelled from school after an innocent, unconsummated townie flirtation, walked, barge-floated, rode horseback, hitckhiked (lorries, Bugattis, woodcutter sledges), but mostly walked from Rotterdam to Constantinople. A Time of Gifts (1977) gets Leigh Fermor as far as the verge of Hungary, and his lumber room is packed with the loot of Central Europe. There's his passport, ""crammed with the visas of vanished kingdoms."" And a peasant table, with ""raw knuckles of enormous hands"" amid ""the cut onions and the chipped pitchers and a brown loaf broken open."" Heavy steins, a chandelier of interlocked antlers, a cask of Rhine wine. Horace and Hölderlin in scholar gypsy-size, pocket portable editions plucked from baronal libraries and bestowed in parting on the hobnail-booted, putteed, greatcoated Leigh Fermor as he prepared to step off into the snows once more. An Augusburg choir stall, specimen of Germany's blunt realism in woodcarving, showing ""highly polished free-standing scenes of Biblical bloodshed,""On the first Jael, with hanging sleeves and hatted like a margravine, gripped a coal hammer and steadied an iron spike among the sleeping Sisera's curls.Leigh Fermor is really into the Thirty Years War, so the curio emporium must include a composite warlord portrait:The polyglot captains of the multi-lingual hosts hold our gaze nilly-willy with their grave eyes and Valesquez moustaches and populate half the picture galleries of Europe. Caracoling in full feather against a background of tents and colliding squadrons, how serenely they point their batons; or, magnanimously bare-headed and on foot in a grove of lances, accept surrendered keys, or a sword! Curls flow and lace or starched collars break over the black armour and the gold inlay; they glance from their frames with an aloof and high-souled melenacholy which is both haunting and enigmatic.And to stand for the strange political ruin of the lands in which Fermor wandered, there's the symbolic gold key once worn on the uniform of a Hapsburg court chamberlain--But now the Empire and the kingdom had been dismembered and their thrones are empty; no doors opened to the gold keys, the heralds were dispersed, the regiments disbanded and the horses dead long ago.With one book, Leigh Fermor makes an easy leap into my ""favorites."" A Time of Gifts is magical, Pale Fire-, Speak, Memory-magical, richly responsive to nature, art, people and history, and with a style so perfectly evocative that you think of sorcery. On to its sequel, Between The Woods and The Water! He's on a borrowed horse, cantering across the great Hungarian plain, thinking of the Magyar and other migrations. ",27,6
253984,A Time of Gifts,Grace Tjan,188,487,4,"December 9, 2011","At the tender age of eighteen, on the cusp of adulthood and having been expelled from his last school, young Patrick Leigh Fermor decided to go on a walkabout through the pre-war Mitteleuropa wonderland, all the way to the distant minarets of Constantinople. These are some of the people and things that he encountered along the way:1.	Goose-stepping Brownshirts and beer-swilling S.S. officers		“The song that kept time to their tread, “Volk, ans Gewehr!” ---often within earshot during the following weeks was succeeded by the truculent beat of the Horst Wessel Lied: once heard, never forgotten…”2.	Village stores stocked to the gills with Nazi paraphernalia		“…swastika armbands, daggers for the Hitler Youth, blouses for Hitler Maidens and brown shirts for grown-up S.A. men; swastika button-holes were arranged in a pattern which read Heil Hitler and an androgynous wax-dummy with a pearly smile was dressed up in the full uniform of a Sturmabteilungsmann.”But also:3.	Brueghelian winter idylls		“A minute later, it was a faraway speck, and the silent landscape, with its Brueghelish skaters circling as slowly as flies along the canals and the polders, seemed tamer after its passing. Snow had covered the landscape with a sparkling layer and the slatey hue of the ice was only becoming visible as the looping arabesques of the skaters laid it bare. Following the white parallelograms the lines of the willow dwindled as insubstantially as trails of vapour. The breeze that impelled those hastening clouds had met no hindrance for a thousand miles and a traveler moving at a footpace along the hog’s back of a dyke above the cloud-shadows and the level champaign was filled with intimations of limitless space.”4.	Friendly peasants in clogs and lots of cows	“In the barn on the other side, harrows, ploughshares and scythes and sieves loomed for a moment, and beyond, tethered to a manger that ran the length of the barn, horns and tousled brows and liquid eyes gleamed in the lantern’s beams.”5.	Gemutliche gasthauses with kind proprietors	“…for in the end someone woke me and led me upstairs like a sleep-walker and showed me into a bedroom with a low and slanting ceiling and an eiderdown like a giant meringue.”6.	Party-loving, pretty Frauleins		“When I woke up on the sofa---rather late; we had sat up talking and drinking Annie’s father’s wine before going to bed---I had no idea where I was; it was a frequent phenomenon on this journey.”7.	Kooky aristocrats and fascinating pedants with a yen for the glorious days of the Kaiser and the Austro-Hungarian Empire		“The Count was old and frail. He resembled, a little, Max Beerbohm in later life, with a touch of Franz Joseph minus the white side-whiskers.”		8.	A Shakespeare quoting, enterprising tramp		””Ah, dear young!” he said, “I am of ripe years already! I would always be frightening them! You, so tender, will always melt hearts.””		9.	Balkan Ghettoes full of living Hasidic Jews		”…Talmudic students of about my age…their cheeks were as pale as the wax that lit the page while the dense black lettering swallowed up their youths and their lives.”10.	Grunewald’s horrific crucifixion		“…the special law of gravity, tearing the nail-holes wider, dislocates the fingers and expands them like spider’s legs. Wounds fester, bones break through the flesh and the grey lips, wrinkling concentrically round a tooth-set hole, gape in a cringing spasm of pain. The body, mangled, dishonoured and lynched, twists in rigor mortis.”And most importantly:11.	Grand architecture --- to wax poetic about in a sensory-overloaded, vertigo-inducing manner.The painted ceiling at the Melk Abbey		“...rococo flowers into miraculously imaginative and convincing stage scenery. A brilliant array of skills, which touches everything from the pillars of the colonnade to the twirl of a latch, links the most brittle and transient-seeming details to the most magnificent and enduring spoils of the forests and quarries. A versatile genius sends volley after volley of fantastic afterthoughts through the great Vitruvian and Palladian structures. Concave and convex uncoil and pursue each other across the pilasters in ferny arabesques, liquid notions ripple, waterfalls running silver and blue drop to lintels and hang frozen there in curtains of artificial icicles. Ideas go feathering up in mock fountains and float away through the colonnades in processions of cumulus and cirrus. Light is distributed operatically and skies open in a new change of gravity that has lifted wingless saints and evangelists on journeys of aspiration towards three-dimensional sunbursts and left them levitated there, floating among cornices and spandrels and acanthus leaves and architectural ribands crinkled still with pleats from lying long folded in bandboxes...”Fermor’s writing is as marvelous as the brooding castles and baroque palaces that he encountered along his journey, but at times so dizzyingly rich and dazzlingly erudite that it is best taken in measured doses at a time. European culture and history is an open book in his hands and what a wonderful and profoundly strange place it is!Prepares sturdy boots for the remaining trek to Constantinople.",22,11
253984,A Time of Gifts,Trish,"1,352",2397,4,"July 2, 2015","Fermor is considered by many to be one of the great travel writers in our time. I note he waited many years before he wrote of his wanderings. He kept a notebook, several really, and added and embellished what had not occurred to him at nineteen when he was walking to Constantinople. He admits to being a green young thing and, while he had a good education and many gifts, it is his insatiable curiosity and open demeanor that gained him so many friends and helpful companions. This is what should be required reading in high school. Not college, but high school. We want youth to realize that the world is theirs, but they must first learn to navigate just a little, and prepare to be on their own. One should not have to require the whole book: just the first 120 pages should suffice. By the time Fermor has told of his ""hoggish catalepsy"" at Munich’s Hofbraushaus, if there is no comprehension in dull minds, there is no need to explain that one must have something to work with before one goes off wandering alone. The ecstatic enthusiasm and excitement of youth is everywhere evident. What it takes to succeed in the world is a great deal, but mostly it is interest in the world. It can be taught. I think.Fermor indulges and cultivates his interest in architecture on his journey. It would be hard not to be impressed with the gorgeous relics on display throughout Europe. His impression of the ""scenes of Biblical bloodshed [run] riot"" in the churches made me laugh with recognition. My first visit to Europe produced the same feelings of shock and awe to see in churches the graphic display of Christ’s crucifixion. Oh, what a moment in time Fermor captures: the brown shirts consolidating their power in Germany and Europe between the wars. He caught a little of that held-breath tension, and reviled himself for ever after for missing the significance of the street fighting in Vienna. ""I bitterly regretted this misappraisal later on: like Fabrice in La Chartreuse de Parme, when he was not quite sure whether he had been present at Waterloo."" When I was younger, though not young enough perhaps, I remember someone pressing into my hands a copy of the terrific travel story News From Tartary by Peter Fleming. It made me realize that such kind of travel was achievable, even something to strive for. If only Cheryl Strayed in her memoir Wild had taken a leaf from Fermor’s book, her own work would have been substantially improved. But then, her work would have been better also had she followed the very different and equally anguished memoir by Helen Macdonald H is for Hawk which of course did not come out until after Strayed’s memoir. The exceedingly popular Wild did nothing for me but put me in a bloody state of mind while the other two memoirs add something both to my understanding and to my enjoyment of the world. Rather early on in this book, Fermor makes glancing reference to his time in Crete when he captured a German general and secreted him away in a cave, something for which he would ever be famous. He tells of how they spoke lines of the same poem, first one then the other, realizing that at some distant time ""they’d both drunk from the same spring."" That capture was immortalized in a 1950s book by Stanley Moss called Ill Met: By Moonlight and a 1957 film starring Dirk Bogarde called Night Ambush. I adore what Fermor discovers about Shakespeare as he searched for reasons Shakespeare would have placed an Bohemia near the sea in one of his plays: ""Shakespeare didn’t care a fig for the topography of the comedies. Unless it were some Italian town—Italy being the universal lucky dip for Renaissance playwrights—the spiritual setting was always the same. Woods and parkland on the Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire borders, that is; flocks and fairs and a palace or two, a mixture of Cockayne- and Cloud-Cuckoo- and fairyland with stage mountains rather taller than the Cotswolds and full of torrents and caves, haunted by bears and washed, if need be, by an ocean teeming with foundering ships and mermaids.""And this is a small thing, perhaps, but it so illuminates why Fermor was such a great travel writer: he becomes completely enraptured one night standing on a bridge in Prague, looking over the Vltava and tracing in his mind the twists and turns of the river--distances and changes in culture--on its way to the sea. It is Fermor looking at it, thinking about it, and speaking of it that makes the river a marvel of space and time.",22,7
253984,A Time of Gifts,Jonfaith,"1,821",1321,5,"May 5, 2020","At school some learning by heart was compulsory, though not irksome. But this intake was out-distanced many times, as it always is among people who need poetry, by a private anthology, both of those automatically absorbed and of poems consciously chosen and memorized as though one were stocking up for a desert island or for a stretch of solitary.The evidence of the ""amazing"" rating in this instance is that I sat raptured and read all day long. It wasn't a diversion or an escape from tedium. No, reading Fermor was enthralling. Most people now know the context where an 18 y/o Fermor in 1933 decides to walk from Holland to Constantinople. So he does. He wrote this trilogy of account over thirty years later and there is a bit of refocusing and jumping outside of the actual experience. That makes a compelling narrative as does his insertion of actual diary entries during his pilgrimage. His mind is filled with poetry, with architecture and painting. he meets interesting people who gloss over thousands of years of history with terse but bold erudition. There isn't a great deal of self doubt here which is possibly a result of mature editing but somehow I think he was simply more purposed. He creates a social event in one singular instance as he fears he is an affront to his potential hosts. he wasn't but isn't able to step back into the situation. he has to proceed with the farce. that is on the instance I encountered and I marvel at that, especially in in reflection of my own life and travel. I just bought several more volumes of his and am considering sitting by the mailbox in anticipation. ",22,N/A
