3087,A Room with a View,Meghna Agrawal (On a Review-Writing Break!),72,313,5,"September 17, 2022","It took me longest to put across and structure my views, for this Classic. Weighing light as a physical copy, but out-weighing many others thematically, this book delineates complex-sensitive issues of religion, passion, respectability and coming-of-age, without rendering itself into a rebellion or a mundane tone for a wee! It subtly highlights ‚Äì Experience is the most valuable teacher!! As we witness the prime character of Lucy, growing into a female with grit and determination, from a docile young woman, all through her multifold experiences !!E.M. Forster‚Äôs novel, A Room with a view, in written as an omniscient narration, with Lucy Honeychurch (a young woman living in a restrained culture) as the prime-focused character. 
  She is the edifice for the coming-of-age theme, and her journey from adolescence into adulthood is beautifully portrayed. In this process of growing-up, she not only affects her own life, but of the people she stumbles into. Lucy has a challenge to find strength and conviction to claim her own happiness, and comes out of the shackles of timidity and subservience. (I may sound too critical and passionate with my words, but this is the side-effect of this sensible, sensitive and passionate novel!). 
The novel opens in Florence, Italy, where Lucy along with her chaperone, her cousin, Charlotte Bartlett, has arrived at a Pension. It is here where Lucy's life is set on a spin, and her ""coming of age"" theme is catalysed and ends up meeting-up many unconventional characters. Charolette , complaining upon not being offered rooms with a prime view, meets a warmly gentleman and his son, George Emerson, who offer to trade their rooms with them, but in a tactless manner. Charlotte, who subscribes to the rule of social niceties, finding the Emersons ‚Äúill-bred‚Äù, and for the impropriety of the offer, turns down the offer. The following morning, the two meet, Mr. Beebe, the new vicar from neighbourhood, who convinces them to accept the Emerson's offer without fear of impropriety.Lucy, as she copes with the repressive Charlotte, the tactless Emersons, and the mildly interfering Mr. Beebe, is described as ‚Äúbewildered‚Äù. Charlotte, in no mood to leave the room, allows Lucy to frolic and explore the city, along with an independent woman, Miss Lavish, whom they met the evening before. Miss Lavish, tells Lucy-‚ÄúI will take you by a dear dirty back way, Miss Honeychurch, and if you bring me luck, we shall have an adventure.‚ÄùAdditionally, she insists Lucy to liberate herself from the travel-guide/ Baedeker and explore Italy by wandering aimlessly. ‚ÄúI hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker. He does but touch the surface of things. As to the true Italy‚Äîhe does not even dream of it. The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation.‚ÄùSoon giving up on the enjoyable mate, Lucy, all peevish, regretting giving up the Baedeker, attempts finding her way back to the Pension all-alone. The magical charm of Italy, plays its magic on her, and, instead of acquiring information, she happily puzzles out of the Italian notices, forbading people, introducing their dogs to the church and not to spit in the church, considering the sacredness of the edifice, the church. Soon Lucy finds herself in close proximity with old Mr. Emerson, as both rush to help a stumbling child. He says , ""Here's a mess; a baby hurt, cold and frightened. But what do you expect from a church?"" These lines were abominably impertinent for Lucy. The rigid tenets of Christianity are pitted and spouted by Mr. Emerson. Mr. Emerson later in the book, confesses that his resistance to conventional religious beliefs is caused by his own wife's death, and any kind of extreme spiritual dogma can prove dangerous. ( I am neither ""in"" nor ""against"" this religious representation by the author, as for me, religion/spirituality is a personal-affair, and the extent to which one follows is again a personal-choice! üòä)Mr. Emerson remains the centre of the exposition of the religious and moral beliefs, just like Lucy represents themes of ‚Äúcoming-of-age‚Äù and ‚Äúpassion‚Äù! Lucy, sets out on a solitary stroll, when upon witnessing a fight/murder, faints, just to wake up in the arms of George Emerson. Embarrassed due to the impropriety of the situation, requests George not to disclose to anyone that she was caught in his arms.The entire gang, Lucy and her cousin, the Emersons, Mr. Eager (the chaplain who threw Lucy and the Emersons out of the Giotto earlier), Miss Lavish, set out on an excursion. On this trip, George kisses Lucy impulsively and is caught by a horrified Miss Bartlett. After this romantic interlude, Lucy is rushed to Rome, where she ends up meeting a young man named Cecil Vyse. Sharing a lack of passion, yet Lucy and Cecil get engaged. Cecil ends-up meeting the Emersons in a museum (unaware of their connection to Lucy). Lucy decides to endure a platonic friendship with George. In due course of events, George kisses Lucy again, confessing his love for her. He gives reasons to her to stop the marriage. Although Lucy resists George's advice, she soon realizes for herself that she does not want to marry Cecil and breaks off the engagement. The two get married privately and proceed to the Pension Bertolini in Florence for their honeymoon. (Life comes back full circles!). The outstanding theme of passion concludes the novel. Apart from Lucy‚Äôs passion for arts, music and culture, her constant underlying passion for George, helps her to culminate her marriage with George! Lucy starts off as a docile young woman of a decent conservative upbringing in the novel, but grows into an outspoken female, having gained experience through all events in the novel. A Room with a View, metaphorically alludes to the room Lucy and Charlotte boards in Pension Bertolini, where is she introduced to the Emersons. It is in Italy; she discovers life and marks her journey from adolescence to adulthood. She comes out of the stifling shackles of the polite (the olden reserved)British society, and views the world with a wider-view!By far this is one the most likeable and sensible stuff in the repository of my brain. This book has taught me a lot, on how to condense and tersely present the overflowing and passionate thoughts and emotions, which the mind and heart, hold! A definite 5-star üòäNb- I am not ""in"" or ""against"" the subtle condemnation of religious beliefs in the novel, every individual has her/his own belief-set and religious/spiritual journey, and I respect that ! Mr. Emerson, changed his beliefs post his wife's demise and personal experiences, and never enforced his views on anyone, but just expressed!!",279,71
3087,A Room with a View,Candi,598,4532,5,"July 14, 2018","4.5 stars""Italians are born knowing the way. It would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares. Any one can find places, but the finding of people is a gift from God.""Ah, there is nothing like a vacation to rest the body and soothe one‚Äôs soul‚Ä¶ well, this would be the ideal holiday in any case. Family trips to Disney World would not fall in this category. Nor would my latest adventures ‚Äì college visits. Even last year‚Äôs escape to a gorgeous beach resort to celebrate my 20 year anniversary could not be termed serene or inspiring or meditative; after all, two teens tagging along on that momentous occasion changes the entire tone of a trip as well. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was still a lovely celebration, and who better to spend it with if one can‚Äôt go alone than with the two greatest accomplishments of your twenty years of marriage?! Apparently, what I am in desperate need of, however, is a trip to Italy. Or someplace that will infuse me with such a feeling of life as it did Lucy Honeychurch in this unforgettable novel! I first read this book at the tender age of 17 when I was assigned E.M. Forster as ‚Äòmy author‚Äô to delve into for an AP English project. I successfully completed the task, but I can tell you that there is no way this book had the same effect then as it did now. This book was brilliantly written and such a joy to read. I commend Forster for his progressive feminist views. While in Florence with Charlotte, her much older cousin and chaperone, Lucy meets the Emersons. The elder Mr. Emerson and his son George are not the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô tourists of this new Edwardian society, nor are they your average English gentlemen. This is quite evident from the start when they offer to change rooms with Lucy and Charlotte. While the ladies have simple rooms with a view of a courtyard, the Emerson‚Äôs view is a marvelous one that takes in both the Arno and the Apennines. It also becomes quite apparent early on that these men offer not just a different view of Italy, but perhaps of societal norms, love, and life itself. ""‚Ä¶ she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt, not with rooms and views, but with‚Äîwell, with something quite different, whose existence she had not realized before."" Trapped between the old Victorian mores and the developing and less constricting Edwardian values, Lucy‚Äôs world is shaken up as she struggles with the conflict between her own true desires and the more rigid expectations of her gender and her place in society. A chance encounter with the young, tender and tragic George Emerson leaves Lucy feeling alternately awakened and yet sincerely confused.The second half of the novel shifts the setting to Lucy‚Äôs home at Windy Corner in England. Here it becomes perhaps easier to accept the social codes without the ‚Äòthreat‚Äô of the Emersons or the seductive allure of Italy. Or does it? Soon it becomes quite clear that Lucy‚Äôs soul-searching has not come to a halt. ""‚Ä¶ she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy, that it is impossible to rehearse life. A fault in the scenery, a face in the audience, an irruption of the audience on to the stage, and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing, or mean too much."" I hesitate to give away any real details of the plot any further as not to spoil it; you really just need to pick this one up and observe Lucy‚Äôs struggles and transformations for yourself. Forster also introduces us to Lucy‚Äôs brother, Freddy, who is rather refreshingly unconventional, as well as the puffed up prig, Cecil Vyse. In fact, Forster introduces an array of characters that you will not soon forget, and I love the various names attached ‚Äì Mr. Beebe, Miss Lavish and Mr. Eager. The character development of each and every one is brilliant.I highly recommend this as a very accessible classic novel. Not too heavy yet very forward-thinking. The romance is endearing without being sappy. There is some wonderful satire about social conventions that I very much appreciated. I seem to need a bit of humor in these classic works to lighten the mood just a bit, so well done Mr. Forster. The book is simply enchanting and I can‚Äôt wait to watch yet another highly regarded screen adaptation. 4.5 stars rounded up since I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about this one.""I must get away, ever so far. I must know my own mind and where I want to go."" ""The world is certainly full of beautiful things, if only I could come across them.""",271,94
3087,A Room with a View,Jim Fonseca,"1,073",6799,4,"May 22, 2020","A Room with a View by E. M. ForsterA novel of manners by a master. It is set in England in the early 1900‚Äôs -- the Edwardian era. As we are told in the introduction, D. H. Lawrence wrote ‚ÄúAbout social existence, E. M. Forster knew everything.‚Äù Christopher Isherwood called him the expert on ‚ÄúMy England.‚Äù If we switched the setting to the USA, I would think I was reading Edith Wharton. Or Henry James without the subclauses. We start off with a young upper-middle class British woman visiting Florence. She is chaperoned by a much older cousin. They are disappointed that their room in the pension does not have the promised view. An older man and his son offer to exchange rooms with them. In a private moment the young man, the son, kisses the young woman. She also has another ‚Äúadventure:‚Äù she witnesses a murder in the street. Such were Edwardian times that the social complexities of the two women accepting or rejecting this offer of the room, and the young woman‚Äôs reaction to the kiss, sets the entire plot in motion for 200 pages. Of course in that era the burden of dealing with that stolen kiss falls entirely on the woman. It affects her relationship with her cousin, her mother, her fianc√© back in England, her uncle who is a minister and more.The first half of the story is set in Italy and the second half back at her home in England. We learn a lot about how the British took great pains to avoid (apparently) ‚Äúgetting contaminated‚Äù by Italians! The women stay at a pension run by an English woman; they attend services conducted by a British minister. They have a prescribed list of what must be seen. (There were multiple references to Della Robbia babies, so I looked them up ‚Äì see picture.) In a remarkable coincidence, the man who kissed her ends up an immediate neighbor back in England, now friends with her brother and fianc√©. The young woman has to wrestle with social propriety, gossip and the choice of ‚Äòdoing the right thing‚Äô or following her heart. Her fianc√© is controlling and she revolts against him trying to shape her into his opinion of what a woman ‚Äòshould be.‚Äô So we can also see the story as a feminist text. Here‚Äôs some of what the young woman is up against: ‚ÄúWhy were most big things unladylike? Charlotte [her cousin] had once explained to her why. It was not that ladies were inferior to men; it was that they were different. Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves. Indirectly, by means of tact and a spotless name, a lady could accomplish much. But if she rushed into the fray herself she would first be censured, then despised, and finally ignored. Poems had been written to illustrate this point.‚Äù There is good writing, biting social commentary and humor: ‚ÄúHe seems to see good in everyone. No one would take him for a clergyman.‚ÄùOf her mother: ‚Äú‚Ä¶she doesn‚Äôt like anyone to get excited over anything‚Ä¶‚ÄùOf the father and son duo: ‚ÄúThey must find their level.‚Äù Advice to the young woman from her cousin: ‚Äú‚Ä¶this our life contains nothing satisfactory.‚Äù E. M. Forster was a gay man, publicly in the closet, although open to his best friends. He lived a long life: 1879 to 1970. A Room with a View is his best-known work according to GR, with about twice as many ratings as either Howards End or A Passage to India. Very early in his life Forster wrote a novel about a gay love affair, Maurice, but it was not published until the year after his death. He must hold the record for being nominated for the Nobel prize but never being awarded one: 16 times. The book was made into a Merchant Ivory film in 1985.

3087,A Room with a View,Henry Avila,446,3219,4,"May 27, 2020","The Pensione (pension) Bertolini in Florence, Italy has everything for the visiting tourists, Miss Lucy Honeychurch and her older poorer cousin Charlotte Bartlett a rather overbearing chaperon, fine food, (not really) wines not too bad this is Italy and a room with a view. Unfortunately not for the cousins, their promised accommodations went to Mr.Emerson and his quiet gloomy son George. If you can't trust the Signora Bertolini, the Italian owner of this establishment more English than one in London, the late Queen Victoria's picture is still on the wall, with a strange Cockney accent who can you? But chivalry is not quite dead, in the early 20th century the ill mannered Mr.Emerson, offers in front of all the other British tourists while they consume their dinner, to exchange rooms two for two , the men don't care as long as they have a good bed, after hearing Charlotte's complaints. Of course Miss Bartlett turned it down, the unseemly idea such a vulgar man, he is not a gentleman no English reserve . Looking around, she sees that confirmed on the faces of the other boarders. Then again, Florence is so beautiful the Arno River flowing nearby, (not too dirty ) the Apennine Mountains, Cypress trees of San Miniato, she will never be here again ... A half- hour later the two cousins open the windows, ( the British love to do this) in the new rooms... with a view. A great country to stare at the exotic attractions, if only the Italians were more civilized Charlotte thinks, but all is well with the world now. Miss Eleanor Ravish a new flighty friend, at the pension and future bad novelist, takes Lucy on a sightseeing trip of the real Italy. And promptly deserts her for an old friend, on the streets of the city, she enters the church alone, they both were to view. How is she to get back to Bertolini ? Not to worry the Emerson's are there, Mr. Emerson the old ""Gentleman"" quickly annoys, then disrupts a visiting British clergyman's lecture inside with his loud disagreeing voice, the unhappy perturbed flock leaves, yet Lucy does get back home safely. Feeling brave and wanting independence and excitement, she receives more than Lucy can handle, Miss Honeychurch goes out by herself. While looking at a palace tower, she is a witness to a gruesome murder, the stabbing of one Italian man against another at close range, blood on her photographs, she just had bought in a shop and faints ...George in love and in the same vicinity, spying ... Picks Lucy up, revives her and takes the lady to safety, the Arno river is near, throwing the messy photos in the stream. She can't believe he did it ... At a later date, descending a mountain road after viewing gorgeous Florence from above, the weather turns bad, the two carriages full of the British visitors from the pension, including Lucy, Charlotte and the old Mr.Emerson, even Miss Lavish. George the cad had kissed Lucy, when she fell on the ground full of exquisite violets, Charlotte luckily comes to the rescue before who knows what George would do next. He runs away the coward and vanishes, nobody knows where. But soon Lucy will meet the perfect, ideal, respectable man, Cecil Vyse... In the wet darkness, the rains heavy, lightning strikes, women scream, slowly the party travels, more flashes of lightning, the clouds coming down, the road a liquid mess, the storm gets more violent, they stop for a short rest.

3087,A Room with a View,Steven Godin,"2,281",2149,4,"May 17, 2020","Considered by many to be Forster's sunny day, and most optimistic novel, would start off in Italy, an Inn in Florence to be precise. Two sweet Edwardian females, Miss Lucy Honeychurch (adorable name) and her cousin, Charlotte the chaperone have a bit of a dilemma whilst holidaying, the silly Inn keeper promised them rooms with a view looking out onto the Arno River, but they end up facing the courtyard. (I would have gladly faced the courtyard if it meant being a Tuscan tourist, would have even bedded down in the cellar come to think of it, rats and all). But as luck would have it, two budding hero's come to the rescue. Mr. Emerson, an old man seated with them at dinner suggests that Lucy and Charlotte trade rooms with him and his son, George, which, after first being rather offended at the proposal are advised to do by the Reverend Beebe, a clergyman staying in the same place, who is soon to become the vicar of Lucy's Parish back in Surrey, England.The early part of the novel really showcases Forster's use of dialogue, that finds a good balance between beauty and delicacy, between honesty and propriety. When Lucy ventures out into Florence with the romantic novelist Eleanor Lavish, she runs into the Emersons at the church of Santa Croce. Speaking bluntly, Lucy is torn between accepting kindness and taking offense of the attention, when asked by Mr. Emerson to befriend his son George, Lucy becomes uncomfortable, and hides any emotion, could it be that she is already prematurely in love with someone she only recently met? Especially after she witnesses an altercation, which ends up with her falling into George's arms after a fainting episode.The novel's second half picks up some months later in Surrey, in a house named Windy Corner. The house belongs to the Honeychurch family. And it now appears Lucy has gained entry to an even better society, with that of the sour Cecil Vyse, who has been granted Lucy's hand in marriage (no, Lucy, don't do it!!). Cecil is an imbecile, and sees Lucy as nothing more than a work of art, something to show off, like a fancy antique painting. At heart he is a snob, he just doesn't realize it.It also becomes apparent Cecil has two so called friends, yes, the Emersons!, who arrive back on the scene after a property becomes available on Summer Street, all to the fury of Lucy, who would go on to call off the engagement (good girl!), but not for the love of George. Er..of course not my dear.The acutely observed characters feel so real in this novel and he breathes life into them in such a humane way, although I didn't like them all, it was a pleasure to be in their company. Lucy is quite possibly the most fully fleshed, so much so that even when she lies to herself and to those around her, I found myself sympathizing with her situation instead of condemning her actions. Among many things, A Room with a View is a coming of age story about one young woman's entry into adulthood, and the struggles that face Lucy as she emerges as her own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She is torn between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal morals. In the tussle her own idea of what is true evolves and matures. George, troubled by an existential crisis at such a young age, doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and fulfilling, and seemed shadowed by a dark enigma and a has a question mark above his head. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adored the view of the Arno, whilst George remembers a time of with his parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs, it just takes some soul-searching for them to realize it. George finds simple pleasure in the company of the Honeychurchs, Lucy finds an inner courage to recognize her own individuality through time spent with the Emersons.The story did meander here and there in places, but the novels strength definitely lies in its vivid cast of characters, especially the deep exploration of Lucy's attitude towards life and love. With some great humorous dialogue, and a playful nature, I was very impressed indeed!",138,20
3087,A Room with a View,Madeline,766,46900,3,"July 7, 2011","What happens in Florence, stays in Florence.Unless this is the early 1900's and you're visiting the city with your annoying spinster cousin, then you kiss some boy in a field of violets for like two seconds and nobody ever lets you forget it. Jeez, people. This is a brief, sweet little novel about Lucy Honeychurch (winner of the prestigious award for Most Adorable Name Ever), who goes to Florence with previously-mentioned spinster cousin. Despite lack of A ROOM WITH A VIEW, Lucy has a very nice time, sees some artwork, does some self-discovery, and smooches a very unsuitable boy (escandalo!) who might be a Socialist (double escandalo!). Then they go back to England and she gets engaged to a schmuck. For this part of the novel, I was mostly coasting along, having a reasonably good time reading about well-off English people and their Well-Off English People Problems (""Our Italian pension is owned by a Cockney lady! So-and-so isn't the right kind of blandly religious! And for the love of God WHO WILL YOU MARRY?!""). It was mildly entertaining, and I was a huge fan of Mr. Emerson from the get-go. George, sadly, never quite did it for me, and Lucy I found to be kind of boring until, UNTIL, the glorious moment when she breaks up with her lame fiance and gets awesome. Here's part of her breakup speech:""When we were only acquaintances, you let me be myself, but now you're always protecting me...I won't be protected. I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right. To shield me is an insult. Can't I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you? ...you wrap yourself up in art and books and music, and would try to wrap up me. I won't be stifled, not by the most glorious music, for people are more glorious, and you hide them from me. That's why I break off my engagement."" Bella Swan, are you paying attention? Because this concerns you. After that moment, I was suddenly 100% invested in Lucy and her attempts to figure herself out. Maybe I imagined it, but it seemed like the writing became so much more beautiful after that, and I was reading the story more carefully and with more interest than I had before. It was a slow start, but Forster's fantastic characters managed to win me over in the end (yes, even the annoying spinster cousin).",132,16
3087,A Room with a View,Piyangie,504,360,5,"July 29, 2022","A Room with a View is a story of love, a story of self-realization of a young woman, and a story of the Edwardian English society still governed by strict Victorian values. Written at the beginning of the Edwardian era, Forster critically exposes the cultural restrictions, class differences, and rigidly maintained social status that had swallowed the English society. The story is set up in England and Italy and Forster with his crafty and witty writing style draws a comparison between English cultural rigidity and Italian cultural relaxation.The opening of the book is a scene in a pension in Italy, where a group of English tourists who, being in a foreign country, were still divided by class. There was the assumption that George Emerson was a porter just because he works on the railway, although in fact, he is a clerk. And he is outrightly considered a cad because of his ‚Äúlower‚Äù class and somewhat relaxed behavior toward those who are stifled by convention. The old Emerson who speaks out his mind freely is considered vulgar by the ‚Äúrespected‚Äù English. Although civility is maintained on the face of it, the Emersons are ignored and isolated for the most part because of the highly revered concept of ‚Äúclass difference‚Äù. I was genuinely struck by the severity of this division and enjoyed Forster‚Äôs exhibition of displeasure through his witty writing.The focus of the story is a young woman named Lucy and her journey of finding both herself and love. It is not an easy journey, as she has to hurdle through strong social barriers. The inner struggle that she goes through is the struggle of young men and especially young women in Edwardian society, being torn between strict conventions and emerging modern opinions. Forster is radical. He mocks the Victorian perceptions to which strings the old generation still held fast and supports the view of mixed-class marriages in the wake up of a new middle class which was steadily brought forth by industrialization.Forster‚Äôs writing is both poetic and picturesque. He draws us into a world that is beautiful notwithstanding its imperfections, petty differences, and minor annoyances and irritations. There is also irony and humour. And Forster‚Äôs use of symbology, subtly or otherwise, is simply marvelous. The sun, the river, the mountains, fields of violets, Italy, the water, the playing of music ‚Äì everything has its own mystery, its own workings on the human mind. Forster has captured this beautifully and sincerely.The most important however is the ‚Äúview‚Äù. When the young Lucy who belongs to the upper-middle class arrives at the Italian pension, she finds her room has no view. Forster tells us that that should be just. Overprotected and bound by conventions, chaperoned by an old lady who worships Victorian ideals, Lucy has no ‚Äúview‚Äù. But the Emersons, who represent the newly emerging working class have a ‚Äúview‚Äù. The newly learned working class is slowly adapting themselves to the new modern way of thinking, and they are no longer weighed down by conventions. So, they have a ‚Äúview.‚Äù Lucy, still at the impressionable age, falls for young Emerson with a ‚Äúview‚Äù, but it is nipped in the bud by the Victorian chaperon. And the flower to which Lucy was to be bloomed was handed to the upper-class Cecil who is in a closed room with no ‚Äúview‚Äù whereby the flower slowly withers. But sunlight, water, love, and joys of youth come to the rescue and present Lucy with a solid and lasting ‚Äúroom with a view‚Äù.A Room with a View undoubtedly is one of the masterpieces that I have had the privilege to read. It is complete; it is perfect.",125,18
3087,A Room with a View,Glenn Sumi,404,1493,4,"August 6, 2020","Edwardian-era propriety meets Italian passion with entertaining results in E.M. Forster‚Äôs sunny, slight, but ever so charming comedy of manners. Well-known from the sumptuous Merchant-Ivory adaptation (which I rewatched immediately after finishing the book), the novel tells the story of Lucy Honeychurch, a proper English girl who, while on vacation in Florence with her cousin/chaperone, Miss Bartlett, meets George Emerson, a handsome but odd philosophical soul, who‚Äôs travelling with his eccentric, truth-telling father.All four are staying at the Pension Bertolini, and the others they meet there ‚Äì the lady novelist Eleanor Lavish, the two older, unmarried sisters (dubbed the Miss Alans), and someone from Lucy‚Äôs village, the very accommodating Reverend Arthur Beebe ‚Äì will cross paths with them later in unexpected ways. As in the other books by him I‚Äôve read, Forster‚Äôs narration is delightfully genial. He‚Äôll remind us, for instance, that we haven‚Äôt really spent much time with a particular character, tell us that we know more about Lucy‚Äôs actions than she does herself, hint at plot developments to come, and generally treat his characters with a satiric, gently chiding tone. At times that tone can seem trivial; midway through the book I felt it was all just so much upper-middle-class flim flam. (More quibbles: George‚Äôs physical treatment of Lucy, especially in light of today‚Äôs sensitivity around consent, seems less romantic than troubling. And I know we‚Äôre meant to be at a remove from the authentic Italians in the first half of the book, but I wish we got more than just clich√©s about tempestuous murderers and horny carriage drivers.)But there is so much to enjoy in the book: the tart dialogue, the grand themes of love, country vs. city life, fate and coincidence‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs even a comment on the idea of novels and writers themselves. Lucy‚Äôs mother, a fine comic creation, has a preposterous attitude towards female writers that I‚Äôm sure Forster, a friend and admirer of Virginia Woolf‚Äôs, for one, didn‚Äôt share. I also like that the book‚Äôs stuffiest character, Lucy‚Äôs fianc√©, the pretentious aesthete Cecil Vyse (a whole review could be written on the book‚Äôs beautifully suggestive names), comes across with his dignity intact in his later scenes.If anything, of the main players only the character of George seems the thinnest, which is perhaps why he‚Äôs given some intriguing actions in the film (otherwise he might be a cipher). And I like how a significant scene near the end makes us reflect on the nature and motivation of Charlotte. But above all, I‚Äôll remember this book for its knowing glimpse into the life of a girl discovering her voice, freedom and strength ‚Äì even in a restrictive society. It‚Äôs suggested early in the book that Lucy, a pianist, plays Beethoven in a way that is surprising; if she could apply that same passion to her life it would be quite thrilling to watch. By the end of the book, we see her begin to do that, and yes, it‚Äôs quite something.",119,23
3087,A Room with a View,Emily May,"1,921",29000,3,"May 12, 2012","3.5I am in a classics mood, but after my recent completion of War and Peace I decided to try something a little lighter and less than one tenth of the size. This is how I found my way towards E. M. Forster's 130 page novel about a woman who is forced to make a decision between marrying a wealthy man she will never love and a man of lower class who she knows she can be happy with. Funnily enough, I think it was this story's length that slightly let it down for me, had it been a longer book I'm sure I would have fallen in love with George as everyone else seems to.This book was published in 1908 - a time somewhat between eras for British society. Women could own property and were becoming increasingly free, authors like Jane Austen, George Eliot, Charlotte Bront√´(&Co.) had taken the nineteenth century by storm, and yet women still did not have the vote and they would be expected to get married young, stay at home, and have babies for decades to come. Into this world strolls Lucy Honeychurch, at first a very naive and typical young woman of the time period. But a woman who, as the book progresses, eventually challenges societal conventions and limitations.E. M. Forster is famous for his stories about British society and class and hypocrisy. He was a gay man who spent his entire life hiding his sexuality from an unforgiving world made up of expectations and a very black and white view of what was right and wrong. Though his personal struggles weren't made clear until after his death with the publication of Maurice, it is obvious (to me) that A Room with a View is just one of his various attempts to poke fun at the rigidity of class, gender and sexual boundaries.Lucy longs for independence, freedom from the constrictions of being a woman in 1908, being upper middle class, being a label with a set of rules that she is expected to follow. She wants to live as she goes and define herself in that way, not in a predetermined fashion that stems from centuries of inequalities and the desire for ""appropriateness"". I cannot tell you just how much I loved this idea, I only wanted a longer story to make it perfect. Lucy is such a charming and interesting character that she could have easily held my attention for double the amount of pages in this incredibly short book. Also, I wasn't quite sold on George and I think I was supposed to be, that the point was that the reader would come to love the man who wasn't as wealthy, who wasn't as well-educated. A little more time to get to know George would have made me happy.",113,13

He says that Italy is only a euphuism for Fate .‚ÄùI have the author Sarah Winman to thank for my finally reading this book. One of the characters in her upcoming novel Still Life which I just finished, tells of her knowing E.M. Forster and the book is read by a character in the novel. While this is a social commentary on Victorian England in many ways, it‚Äôs an ode to Florence and it‚Äôs art, to Italy and how full of life it is and a nod to women, surprising for the time reflected here. It was lighter than I expected, and it felt slow at times, but nonetheless a good story with a great ending. My literary travels took me to Italy twice this past week. It will hardly make up for my trip that was canceled last year, but still a beautiful view from any room where I was reading.",107,38
3087,A Room with a View,Susan's Reviews,"1,039",461,5,"November 1, 2021","E.M. Forster had me sighing with pleasure as I read A Room with a View for the very first (but certainly not the last) time when I was a naive teenager.  I also loved the 1985 film adaptation with Helena Bonham-Carter. (I've watched bits of the 2008 Masterpiece Theatre version starring Elaine Cassidy, but only Sinead Cusack's performance held my interest. The 2008 version was not very good, and the screenwriter changed the ending! Sacrilege!) The 1985 movie had a stellar cast, remained pretty faithful to the novel, and the colours and scenes were glorious!This novel had everything: upstart tourists in Florence, Italy complaining about not having a room with a view, a bloody altercation in the market square, and two young people destined to be in love despite the odds and their respective social classes.  I think it is time once again for me to dig out my old copy of this fabulously lyrical masterpiece. I loved the grandiose emotions set loose amongst a group of unsuspecting tourists. Highly recommended!",103,8
3087,A Room with a View,Samadrita,295,4464,4,"August 16, 2014","Romantic comedy this is not. The rosiness of a woman stumbling upon convenient fantasy fulfillment by marrying into privilege and bourgeois wealth do not tinge the themes of this classic. Rather this aspires to the novelty of a sort of female bildungsroman. A woman who is roused into the acknowledgement of her desires and self through the unwitting intervention of men considered unworthy of being even good travel companions - how many male authors/poets/dramatists of Forster's generation have cared enough about class distinctions and gender inequality to fashion such a narrative? I can think of G.B. Shaw- a dramatist unlike Forster, but contemporaneous in stature and rise to fame - who did wean a generation away from the romanticism of war and the burnish of social affluence and forced them into acknowledging the foolishness of prejudices. Shaw, who gave a working class flower girl an indestructible sense of self-worth and a right to reject the suave, much older, educated benefactor in favor of the younger man who loved her without reservations, should be mentioned in the same breath as Forster in my eyes. Both looked upon women as humans and not as passive accessories meant to magnify the worth of the men in their lives and that's reason enough for me to be an unabashed fangirl for life.
  ""He had robbed the body of its taint, the world's taunts of their sting; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire.""
Sexually and emotionally inhibited young woman savoring personal liberty for the first time through the love of a man of inferior social standing who assumes a consciously passive role in earning her affections - this was, perhaps, Forster's way of contradicting and affirming Austenian values at the same time. The very possibility of the intersection of marital bliss and lack of wealth and connections in a prospective husband and disregard for societal approval lay well outside the limits of Austen's imagination but she did endow her many women characters with enough dimensions to be keenly distinguishable from each other. 
  ""They have sinned against passion and truth, and vain will be their strife after virtue. As the years pass, they are censured. Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks, their wit becomes cynicism, their unselfishness hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go.""
What else is there to say? Here's to the unexpected joy of discovering another male author of the last century, who was effortlessly free of the abysmal sexism that is so regrettably palpable in the work of many novelists (of all genders) of the present. Here's to a great story-teller who ventured beyond the narrow horizons conferred on him by his times. I foresee much more Forster in my future. ",101,43
3087,A Room with a View,Carmen,"2,046",1802,5,"December 20, 2022","I'm a sucker for a sweet, kind-hearted, na√Øve and sheltered heroine. Especially when they slowly learn how to be brave. So this book was perfect for me to read.Lucy Honeychurch (how's that for a name) is a sheltered young Englishwoman in 1908. She lives with her mother and little brother Freddy. She goes on an exciting travel-abroad trip with her stuffy older cousin. There she meets the Emersons - also English - old Mr. Emerson who is loving and honest to a fault. His outspoken ways are considered vulgar and shocking, but Lucy thinks he's sweet and recognizes his good heart. And his son - George Emerson - a dashing, thoughtful, rather melancholy man who soon turns Lucy's world upside-down.Why? Because he's handsome? Because he's charming? No. Because he encourages her to think for herself and introduces her to all sorts of crazy ideas about gender equality. I love this type of old-fashioned romance novel where the hero has actual substance and not just a set of six-pack abs.Lucy slowly, slowly starts to think for herself. She starts to grasp what life is really about - living, people, nature, love - not what she's been trained to think that it's about: gossip, being proper, religion, and society's opinion.She makes a huge mistake in bowing to societal pressure and getting engaged to the priggish, domineering, bossy, judgmental and pretentious Cecil Vyse. He adores telling her how to think, who to like, who to sneer at (he loves sneering). He's training her to be a pompous a**hole, just like he is. Luckily for Lucy, George moves into the neighborhood, setting her mind and heart awhirl for a second time.Will she stay with Cecil? Will she end up with George? ...I'm always worried going into a classic book. Sometimes I love them (Anna Karenina, Gone with the Wind, Little Women, Watership Down, White Fang) and sometimes there are boring and dreary and a total slog to get through (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Two Years Before the Mast).I was pleasantly surprised that this book was a joy to read. It's written in a relaxed, easy style that is fun and relatable. I was completely caught up and swept away by Lucy's problems. Cecil was infuriating me to no end. I was yelling at him and cursing him out. Every time George showed up, I'd hold my breath, waiting to see what liberal philosophies he was going to tell Lucy about and get her mind working again.I felt like Cecil was the most frustrating, anger-inducing character. When an author writes an ""evil"" character, let's say a rapist or a murderer or a child-abuser or a slaver, it's obvious this person is bad news. You (the reader) hate him, the protagonist hates him, and you only have to worry about what evil he'll wreck on people's lives. ""Villains"" like Cecil are much more insidious. They don't commit crimes, or physically hurt anyone. Instead, they take great delight in putting other people down in subtle ways, controlling others, and caring only about themselves and their own needs. Cecil doesn't KNOW he's a jerk - he's very insecure about his masculinity and therefore takes out his doubt and frustration by pretending to be the ""big man,"" telling others what to do all the time and expressing contempt for people that he sees as 'beneath him.' He uses Lucy as a prop for his own ego - she is such a sweet, innocent, sheltered woman that he makes the mistake in thinking she's also docile. Having someone like this at his side makes him feel like a big, strong man. Putting others down and making them feel small is also a way he makes himself feel better. But he is proper and has money and good standing in society, so Lucy thinks he must be right in his opinions - and everyone around her encourages her to marry him.Lucy herself impressed me a lot. I could see that a lot of people would just see her as a sheltered girl who is rather stupid. But I don't. She's being raised in a society where being proper is everything. Women aren't supposed to think, they're supposed to get married and have children. Lucy is someone I admire because even though she's sheltered, she hungers for a world greater than the one she's living in. She doesn't even realize it, but there's a big hole in her life that afternoon tea with gossipy ladies can't fill. Going to Italy and seeing the beauty and different society there starts to open up her eyes - aided by a kiss from George.After moving back to England, she finds herself again bowing to the constraints and demands of proper English society. She makes a mistake in getting engaged to Cecil. But when George shows up again, the gears in her head start turning again - and she  realizes that Cecil is annoying and tiring to be around. She bravely goes to him and breaks off their engagement. She tells him straight out that his behavior is appalling and she doesn't appreciate him telling her what to do and think. She expresses anger that he looks down at her mother and brother with contempt. I thought she was so brave and strong to be able to do this. I really admired her. In the end, she STILL doesn't want to admit that she loves George, but a heart-to-heart talk with George's father soon straightens her out. She elopes with George but has to accept estrangement from her family and friends for her 'scandalous,' 'improper' behavior. I love that, not only does she stand up to Cecil, but she stands up to George. He's always putting down Cecil as a man who likes telling her how and what to think - and she calls George on doing the same thing. Touch√©. He realizes that he himself is trying to bring her around to his way of thinking, and apologizes. Lucy turns into a very brave and outspoken woman, and I really like that she calls ""bullshit"" not only on the ""bad guy"" - Cecil - but on the ""good guy"" George as well.In fact, the best, most attractive guy to me is old Mr. Emerson - a man who truly seems to understand the world and to understand what is important. He is also honest and has a huge heart. But I can see that George is more attractive and more her age - I'd never expect for her to end up with the old widower. But  she gets the best of both worlds - George as a husband and Mr. Emerson as a father-in-law. I was rather sad that she ends up estranged from her family and friends - they may be a bit silly and shallow, but I feel like Lucy really loved them. Tl;dr - One of the better classics. I really enjoyed reading it and was completely caught up in the characters and plot.",100,23
3087,A Room with a View,Julie ,"3,989",58900,3,"July 9, 2021","A Room with a View by E.M. Forster is a 2017 Amazon Classics publication. ( Originally published in 1908)In the continuing saga of 'taming the TBR', I have found it easier to locate classics on my list that I have been meaning to read for years. The brevity of this one convinced me to make time for it immediately instead of letting it continue to gather 'virtual' dust on my Kindle. I had a little trouble with this one- in fact- I almost gave up on it. I was well over halfway in before I felt engaged in it at all. By the time I was finished, though, I was glad I stuck with it. This is a light story, with some dramatics, terrific locales, fantastic characterizations, and a moral that is timeless, but overall, while I enjoyed it enough, it didn't make a lasting impression on me.

3087,A Room with a View,Mark  Porton,351,292,5,"September 15, 2022","A Room with a View by E.M Forster what a delight! This is a Wharton-like comedic piece taking a cynical look at the chattering classes, it is also a love story ‚Äì a magnificent love story!We start in the beautiful city of Florence in the early 1900s ‚Äì where a small group of English well-to-doers are sharing a guesthouse ‚Äì nattering, bickering, gossiping and drinking tea. It seems most of this group were held captive by the suffocating requirements of high-society and all its associated social mores of the times. Our main character Lucy is a likeable but flighty young thing and is being chaperoned by her cousin, Miss Bartlett. Now I found this cousin of Lucy‚Äôs particularly unlikable, she is a bit of a ‚Äòstick in the mud‚Äô and sounds like dreadful company and not a good influence on lovely Lucy at all. To provide some insight into how the English upper crust viewed locals when overseas, read these comments which were particularly discomforting: ‚ÄùI quite agree with you, Miss Allen, The Italians are a most unpleasant people‚Äù‚ÄùAn Italian‚Äôs ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a couple of religious blokes along for the ride ‚Äì Mr Beebe (a rector back home) a good natured and harmless fellow, and then there‚Äôs Mr Eager an ex-pat, living in Florence who is particularly detestable. Uuuuurrrgghh ‚Äì but the most disagreeable of all for me was the poisonous Cecil Vyse. This man, who ensnares the delightful Lucy into engagement ‚Äì is rich, upper-class, negative, snide, a smart arse, a know all and boorish (and they are his better qualities!). Any story like this needs a hero ‚Äì and this spot is capably filled by the old Mr Emerson wonderfully assisted by his son George. These guys are great, particularly Dad ‚Äì he speaks his mind, is generous of spirit and a very open book. But he tends to offend those around him, which is hardly surprising.Oh my, what a suffocatingly proper bunch. So for those who haven‚Äôt read this classic, this is a love story ‚Äì like any good love story, the progression to the desired outcome and be bloody agonising, there were times I felt like jumping into the page and giving those concerned a good shaking (dangerous I know!!!) and making them stop, listen and see ‚Äì and just follow your feelings and your hearts!Sometimes love stories are the most suspenseful of all.This was truly sumptuous. Not only does Forster describe the place of Florence (and Rome ‚Äì see Baths of Caracalla pic ‚Äì sorry I tend to relate everything to Rome!) beautifully, but he also creates the scenes making the reader feel like we are there. However, some of the depictions of the Italians were not so flattering. He describes the intricate dynamics between the stuffy characters brilliantly. Very tongue in cheek at times ‚Äì not quite as biting/funny as Wharton though in my view. Forster also describes the inner-workings of women so well, (Disclaimer ‚Äì see I am a fella‚Ä¶..‚ÄùMark‚Äù, so I cannot be 100% sure) and all of their associated dramas. Lucy was lucky enought to visit the Baths of (that bastard) Caracalla - one of the nastiest Emperors of Ancient Rome, and a complete tool This is a page-turner, it wasn‚Äôt unusual for me to go to bed at 1am, I read and enjoyed this slowly. This afternoon I will shut the curtains and blinds, make a cup of tea (grab a couple of Oreos ‚Äì not English I know), crank up the volume and enjoy. Oh boy the film had better do this story justice!5 StarsMovie comments to follow‚Ä¶..",86,65
