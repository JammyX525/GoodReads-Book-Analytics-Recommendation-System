76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Michael,657,969,5,"December 4, 2018","Introspective, while still attentive to the world outside herself, Solnit meanders in this slow-moving collection centered on the concept of ""getting lost."" The essays read as mosaics of cultural history, autobiography, nature writing, and aesthetic criticism: the depth of Solnit's insight, as well as the vivid contrasts between each essay's parts, rewards careful reading. Those familiar with Solnit through her recent fast-paced political work—typically published first online, later organized into a book—will find a much different kind of writing here. A few of the early essays read as a bit dated, out of step with the ways in which America has changed since the collection's original publication in 2006, but that problem fades as Solnit goes on.",139,12
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Dolors,516,2140,4,"December 27, 2016","The opening chapter of this book can be misleading. Solnit delineates the uneven skyline of the many uncertainties that shape our expectations with surgeon’s precision, employing the perfect choice of words and metaphors, so that the reader falls under the false impression of being handed a map that will eventually lead him to the steady inner balance that will help him navigate the unpredictability of life.What ensues instead is a vibrant mosaic composed of autobiographical flashbacks, labyrinthine references to art, history and the natural world that confuses and dazzles the reader, who can’t help but grope in the dark of Solnit’s dislocated meanderings.Solnit’s digressions revolve around questions of identity and consciousness. Under the ubiquitous leitmotiv that in order to find our way, we need first to get lost and submit to the wilderness of chance, Solnit weaves a complex tapestry that tangentially explores the recollections of her early twenties while commenting on iconic films, painters and writers that became determinant for her emerging worldviews. And so the reader gets to associate Hitchcock’s film “Vertigo” and its love story with San Francisco Bay to Solnit’s affair with a native American in the Mojave desert, or the existential journey of the Spanish conquistador Cabeza de Vaca, who got lost in the wilderness to emerge a new individual, with snippets of Solnit’s family history, drifting along with dreams, ideals and the disorientation that comes with the brutality of reality and impending loss. Solnit gives us a map and then invites us to ignore it so we can learn to live in uncertainty, to embrace the blue of distance without trying to discern the exact shapes in the remote horizon. Being lost or feeling lost generally implies a negative connotation that urges us to plan in advance, to anticipate, to control life events at all costs, which makes us forget the thrill of improvization, of succumbing to whatever is in store for us, accepting it, making it part of ourselves in the ongoing metamorphosing of the self. Embracing emptiness is sometimes the only means towards fulfillment.Leaping into the void doesn’t have to imply freefalling; maybe it’s the required step to touch the sky.Leap into the void by Yves Klein",119,48

76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Wayne,9,3,2,"July 10, 2015","Have you ever been trapped at a cocktail party by someone who, while undeniably smart (and perhaps in a different context might be interesting), is so full of themselves they imagine every single thing they've ever done or thought or experienced is fascinating and you need to hear about it in excruciating detail—for your own good? Mixed tapes, Renaissance painting, rattlesnakes, The Inferno, and love are all in the mix. Naturally, they never once pause to let you participate. Imagine you try to gracefully make excuses to escape them, but they have a self-important way of making poetic meta-comments on the entire situation as well, droning on about the interconnected-ness of, well, nearly everything. Until your will to flee is eventually crushed by the droning and there's nothing left inside you but the desire for sleep. Voila, I give you ""A Field Guide to Getting Lost.""",79,11
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Cecily,"1,094",3831,5,"September 1, 2019","Profound and erudite essays about distance; introspective but painted on a multi-dimensional canvas. They focus on place (deserts, forests, mountains, cities) and loss (abandonment, separation), all mediated through culture (literature, music, and art) and relationships. Solnit’s connecting theme is the need to be lost before you can find yourself. It sounds like the opposite of Matthew 7:7, ""seek and you will find”, but it’s not: being lost is part of seeking, and you can’t be found until you’ve been lost. For Christians, that’s also true in a spiritual sense: you have to acknowledge and repent of your sins before you can be saved. (Her parents are Jewish and Roman Catholic.)Our arrogant ignorance of the natural world keeps park rangers and coastguards busy, but Earth is mapped, so we always know roughly what’s beyond the hill on the horizon. Thus, we are simultaneously more and less able to be lost than early explorers were. Open Door“Stories that make the familiar strange again… Conversations that make everything around them disappear. Dreams that I forget until I realized the have colored everything… Getting lost like that seems like the beginning of finding your way or finding another way.”This gives rationale for the essays that follow. The title refers to the Jewish tradition of leaving the door open overnight at Passover, for Elijah, “a thrilling violation of ordinary practice”.Solnit explores the idea that “it’s the job of artists to open doors”, with examples including Poe, Keats, Woolf, Thoreau, Meno, and Old Norse. She compares being metaphorically lost with being literally lost in unfamiliar wilderness. Modern people are illiterate in the language of the natural world: even if we notice plants, animals, tracks, weather, and geology, we don’t know or understand the significance of particular ones. “How do you find what you can’t even conceive of?”The Blue of Distance“The world is blue at its edges and in its depths. This blue is the light that got lost… The color of that distance is the color of an emotion, the color of solitude and of desire, the color of there seen from here, the color of where you are not.”Image: Georgia O’Keeffe. Light Coming on the Plains, I, II and III, 1917 (Source.)“Distance ceases to be distance and to be blue when we arrive in it. The far becomes near and they are not the same place.”Searing brilliance: the standout piece. I’ve written a tribute-cum-response

.“Some things we have only as long as they remain lost, some things are not lost only so long as they are distant.”Daisy Chain“Things in my family have a way of disappearing… Truth was not a fixed quantity.”Solnit was thus inspired to study history, but this is personal: examining the experiences of her forebears who immigrated to the US: leaving country, culture, and language, forging new identities in an alien land. A daisy chain of people and conflicting stories - and also a specific memory of making daisy chains with her grandmother. “Summer breezes caressed me, my legs stepped forward as thought possessed of their own appetites, and the mountains kept promising.”The Blue of DistanceA history lesson, mourning the fact that we can never be as truly lost in the landscape as the conquistadors in a continent they knew nothing about. Slave narratives teach that sometimes acceptance is the answer! Like early white captives who embraced tribal life, and resisted “rescue”. Like Cabeza de Vaca, who, after ten years, “ceased to be lost not by returning but by turning into something else”. We need to find new ways to be lost, with rituals to mark transitions - and that might mean losing the past to join the present.Abandon“One of the allures of ruins in the city is that of wilderness… a place full of the promise of the unknown.”Image: Abandoned Building, Caven Point NJ, by Peter Hujar, who is mentioned in this essay (Source.)In contrast to natural wilderness, suburbs are like tranquilizers: architecture and topography as drugs. And there’s a sadder story here, about a friend from Solnit’s youth who lived with abandon, but ultimately abandoned her life because of drugs. Her death changed Solnit’s life forever.The Blue of Distance“Every love has its landscape… Thus place… possesses you in its absence.”Musing on music and place, landscape and memory. Country and western songs are about learning from the aftermath of disaster. The blues are “captivity narratives” about “perpetual internal exile” - a contrast to the slave narratives referenced in the preceding Blue essay. Two Arrowheads“It wasn’t particular things but the space between them, that abundance of absence, that is the desert’s invitation.”There is life in the desert, as well as emotion, mystery, and extremes of light and temperature. It’s “alive with the primal forces”. You might even find the odd arrowhead. And tortoises and snakes. “It was the vastness that I loved and an austerity that was also voluptuous… Solitude in the city is about the lack of other people or rather their distance beyond a door or wall, but in remote places it isn’t an absence but the presence of something else, a kind of humming silence in which solitude seems as natural to your species as any other.”The Blue of Distance“Movies are made out of darkness as well as light.”Sometimes people disappear: Amelia Earheart, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, and in some senses, Yves Klein, among others. Klein, an artist, patented International Klein Blue in 1960. He was also a Rosicrucian mystic and a fourth dan blackbelt in judo. The other aspect of this essay is cartography and what’s not included: the difference between what we know we don’t know (terra incognita) and what we imagine we do know (Shangri-La). Knowledge has many limits, including our understanding of it. She notes Donald Rumsfeld’s famous saying about known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns, including the context of his being “one of the vultures making the case for bombing Baghdad’s civilians”. She also highlights what he omitted: “unknown knowns” - our unconscious, or disavowed beliefs.Maps are keys, but do they give us freedom to explore, or lock us into the known?One-Story House“The weight of a dream is not in proportion to its size. Some dreams are made of fog, some of lace, some of lead.”Solnit dreams repeatedly of her single-story childhood home, though the memories are not happy. She pivots to endangered species, and then some success at reversing that in California. It turns out that is partly due to a protection plan her father wrote. By discovering how stressful that job was, she understands and accepts the tensions at home, and thus him. The one-story house is a place for more than one interpretation, more than one story. “It is in the nature of things to be lost.”This was my first Solnit, though it has long been on my radar. I found it in Tate Modern art gallery. Odd (despite one essay about blue and another about Klein), but fortunate. I will return to her.",77,16
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,ValerieLyn,35,10,4,"April 13, 2008","I am obsessed with reading about nomadism. About place, the the experience we have as we move through it, about topography, how it reveals us while simultaneously revealing itself, about wandering, how our thoughts work when we move. Solnit is a fantastic author in this vein.Remember those rambling conversations that you had late late late into the night at some coffee shop when you were not yet twenty something, or maybe you were just, when you were discovering (inventing!?) philosophy, and you managed to link almost everything in the known universe together with some kindred soul, over endless refills and bad french fries, and then you went home, to bed, with a mixture of melancholy, world weariness, hope and the soft satisfaction of a job well done? Solnit rambles this way. Her sources are wide and varied, from the accounts of Cabeza de Vaca as he wandered an undiscovered west, to her father's own master plan for Marin County, to a buddhist abbott's sermon, to her own dreams and recollections. Ideas nest in other ideas, and they are all connected, nesting in songs, childhood memories, lost photos, artistic projects, dreams, cultural myths, historical anecdote, and recollections of moments. Sometimes she explains, sometimes jumpcuts. It is the exact pace of walking, the same rhythm of thinking while moving. Solnit writes about the personal experience of place, and about the layers of memory, memoir, history, and association that places have for each of us. Or maybe better said, what places cause in each of us. It finally occurred to me, in the last pages of the book, what she might be doing. All these disparate elements that she brings into the bookmight otherwise be lost. Her dead high school friend, the abbott's sermon, her thoughts about the American West. She is all over the place, but has created a single spot for all of it. By weaving these snippets together and giving them a place, she ensures that they will not be lost.PS It is fabulous synchronicity that I found and read this book at the same time as Psychogeography; they are utterly different and complementary, two perspectives on the same thing.",50,3
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Lynne King,489,645,5,"November 29, 2016","Rebecca Solnit does indeed have a way with words. The prose is exquisite and she has added a new dimension to getting lost, not only when looking for a place, but also within oneself. I could feel myself accompanying her on her peregrinations and it has indeed taught me a few things about myself that I didn't know.That's all that needs to be said - buy the book, read it, put your feet up, and lose yourself in this remarkable work.

76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Lisa,"1,378",518,3,"March 24, 2021","[3+] A collection of stories, reflections and meditations on getting lost - both as a state of mind and literally in the natural world. Most of these essays require a level of attentiveness which I could not achieve - my currently sluggish mind drifting and getting lost in my own thoughts. I did appreciate most of these essays - especially those of a personal nature.In dreams, nothing is lost. Childhood homes, the dead, lost toys all appear with a vividness your waking mind could not achieve. Nothing is lost but you yourself, wandering in a terrain where even the most familiar places aren't quite themselves and open onto the impossible.",36,14
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,aloveiz,90,9,2,"January 7, 2008","This book is written like a love letter which, in this case, is an insult to its topic.I found many of the anecdotes and references too personal making parts seem more like an autobiography (or collection of excuses) than a cultural document on the idea of being lost. The writing is also full of misplaced lyrical indulgences that detract from the somewhat sporadic historical references that seemed otherwise well researched and interesting. Maybe Solnit couldn't come up with enough material, maybe the book should have been an article, maybe she was just lonely.",34,3
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Vartika,343,581,4,"August 27, 2020","Throughout this book, I couldn't get Picasso's The Blue Room out of my mind. Just like the painting, A Field Guide to Getting Lost holds a deep sense of intimacy; of isolation, the slippage of time and memory; a yearning for and appreciation of the outside. As with the painting, there is a hidden portrait between the covers of this book, a life composed and painted over with disparate, affective visuals, to be lost and found.   The Blue Room (1901), 21 x 24 Oil on Canvas  There is something about Solnit's writing here that's quite like the colour blue—the blue of distance—that dominates it; the beauty of her words derives so much from the landscape around them that it seems to disappear and go out of depth when sought out for itself, so that it is nearly impossible to quote from any essay in this volume. It requires presence, and absence, and knowing, and not knowing, to get lost—be it between these pages or otherwise. A Field Guide to Getting Lost presents a rather different side of Solnit than in her more recent political writing: it is unhurried—purposedly slow, even; a tessellation of essays where cultural history, memoir, nature writing, and aesthetic criticism wash into each other, wave building upon wave until they form delicate rosettes of ideas that, like desert selenite, can best be appreciated in the manner of their coming together; it is in their intricacy and otherworldliness that they become precious perspectives on realities that are otherwise relegated to the mundane. This book has left me with much to think about, and perhaps it will make more—and less—sense in the blue of distance, and out of the blue. I am left thinking that the horizon is made material out of thin air, and that in all our yearning we project our selves onto a lesser an unknown composed of the need for knowing.",33,3
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,julieta,"1,099",1700,3,"February 20, 2018","This is my third try of reading Solnit, and I just have to admit, although I like some of the thoughts she brings, she jumps around too much, and my interest usually starts to wane. I did enjoy some parts of this book, some passing thoughts, but I think she is simply not a writer for me to keep reading.",29,2
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,El,"1,355",504,3,"December 14, 2017","I like Rebecca Solnit a lot. Mostly as a person as the only thing I have read of hers (outside of the occasional Harper's Bazaar essay), the only other book-length writing of hers, has been Wanderlust: A History of Walking. I liked that one; Solnit is a fellow wanderer, which I can appreciate, and she respects the art and culture of pedestrianism, if that's a thing (which I am now claiming is). I have several of her other books marked as To-Read, I even own a couple. But as a person, she generally says all the things I believe or want to know more about, and she has all sorts of adventures I would love to have myself.Also, she and I share the same birthday which means we're meant to be together. One day I will have a birthday party with her and Hope Sandoval and it will be the coolest birthday party ever.I'd be pretty happy to grow up to be Rebecca Solnit. The same way I would be happy to grow up to become Annie Dillard, or Joan Didion, or Susan Sontag. Women essayists have touched me in a way that not a lot of other writers have managed to do, and it's in part due to my patron saints of essays and personal narratives that I decided to return to school 18 years after graduation to get my graduate degree in creative writing (concentrating on creative nonfiction).Similar to Wanderlust, this collection of writing focuses on the art of wandering and how to, in other words, become lost - there are different ways to ""be lost"", and they're not always bad. She writes about the different ways she has lost her way, the different ways she has watched others lose their way, and how all of those things that happen to each and every one of us shape and alter each and every one of us. We all lead such strange and amazing lives. Like if you stop to think about it, even if you're living a standard suburban life that feels ridiculously boring or whatever, if you really stop to think about it your life is actually fairly amazing. Think about all the choices you have made, or the choices others have made around you that have shifted the path you were on at one point in your life. It's fucking bananas, is what it is. But it's also sort of beautiful.Solnit's reading is accessible and somewhat poignant. I think a lot of readers can relate because they can see themselves in Solnit's experiences, or the way she shares her experiences with her readers. She writes about memory in a way that I can really dig, since memory is a theme that usually jumps out to me most in literature and something I spend a shit-ton of time thinking about in my free time because I have a notoriously bad memory. (Actually, it's not bad as much as it's an alternate memory from everyone else.)A city is built to resemble a conscious mind, a network that can calculate, administrate, manufacture. Ruins become the unconscious of a city, its memory unknown, darkness, lost lands, and in this truly bring it to life.(p89)I didn't like this book as much as I liked Wanderlust, and in large part that is because I felt there was more of a mental meandering style through this collection than I remember from Wanderlust - or, at least, it didn't work so well here. She started in one place and wound up somewhere else entirely, and I wasn't always convinced the path from A to Z was all that clear. Sometimes it felt Solnit just wanted to put words down, and not really worry about where she wound up.But it's Rebecca Solnit, she can basically do whatever the fuck she wants. I also believe we learn a lot about ourselves through our own writing, and in a way perhaps Solnit was working out some things with writing this. It doesn't make it a bad collection, but I hoped for a bit more linearity, or consistency, or something.Though if her point was to get lost in her writing, then I can say with confidence: NAILED IT.Her writing is enjoyable as well as it is accessible. She doesn't waste a lot of time being extraneously flowery, but she's in no way dry either. Mostly I just liked being taken on the thought-journey along with Solnit, and then dreaming about the different ways I have been lost throughout life - the good and the bad. It happens to all of us, but Solnit reminds us that this is what it means to life, and what we get out of it is the true measure of success. It's not so much that we get lost from time to time, but it's about how we learn to find ourselves again, and what we learn about ourselves in the process.People look into the future and expect that the forces of the present will unfold in a coherent and predictable way, but any examination of the past reveals that the circuitous routes of change are unimaginably strange. No logic and no prophesy could explain the evolution of the whale from an ancient aquatic creature through eons on land and then back in the sea to become something utterly different from anything that could survive on the surface of the earth.(p122)There's a beauty to getting lost. Giving yourself up to the possibility of adventure and experience. A trust in yourself that no matter what happens, you will be alright. It can be a move to another state to start a new chapter in your life. It can be the decision to return to get a masters degree almost 20 years after receiving a bachelors. It can be quitting a job and starting new somewhere else. It can be going for a long walk in the woods and not worrying about sticking to the trail, or taking a different trail for once, without knowing where it will take you.I love to hear how people have gotten lost. It shows me so much about them, it shows every strength that they embody, whether they think they're strong or not. It's sort of incredible.",28,6

  ""We fly; we dream in darkness; we devour heaven in bites too small to be measured.""
With each day we traverse, do we even know who we truly are, where we come from, where we are going? Getting lost is physical and mental, a state of mind, for ""the mind too can be imagined as a landscape."" We despair whenever we get lost, but what if getting lost is not a problem to be solved, only a necessary route? Solnit often employs 'place' within her writing to expound upon universal truths or to encapsulate a state of mind or state of being, so this collection is reflective, meditative, nuanced. Utilizing an uncommon structure, it is a ballad to the natural world but also a celebration of losing oneself in order to truly find one's true self. It is about the human capacity to extend itself into unfamiliar territory in order to become a different or better version. It is about ""the blue of distance:""
  The blue of distance comes with time, with the discovery of melancholy , of loss, the texture of longing, of the complexity of the terrain we traverse, and with the years of travel.
There is a lot to learn about history (from a historian) and landscapes in these essays. The Faraway Nearby was my absolute favorite of hers (even the prose in that collection is more opulent), but the blue  of this collection I found fascinating. And in those moments when the book's trajectory is surprising, it's like getting lost and finding your way again in an aha moment.",25,5
76479,A Field Guide to Getting Lost,Vipassana,121,333,5,"December 26, 2016","There's something light about this book. Not light in the manner of an enormous buoyant force, but in a tone of equanimity, of sitting on the floor with one's legs crossed. The lightness that comes with accepting the terrible things that can happen in one's life.
  Terrible things happened in that house, though not particularly unusual or or interesting ones; suffice to say there's a reason why therapists receive large hourly sums for listening to that kind of story.
 Rebecca Solnit navigates through her life with a lot of the wisdom that one is able to summon when looking far back into the past, after time has healed. Solnit speaks of a question once asked to her, a very important one for those who are longing to find something unknown.
  How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is unknown to you?
She doesn't know, but she tries to find out. One often forgets that ideas that we dismiss as half baked or trivial, have an essence that can be built upon. It involves the will to live with the unknown and the imperfect. To put the half baked idea back into the oven for a little longer.My favourite thing about a Field Guide to Getting lost is that it found me at the right time, at a time when I needed it.17th February 2015--Just reread much of this.
