87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Negin,591,151,3,"December 24, 2022","I'm feeling generous with 4 Stars. To be fair, I would give it 3.5. This is a beautifully written narrative of life in Venice. It’s a tiny bit flowery with the romance, at least for me, but it still remains sweet. The food descriptions are incredible. The author is a chef who not only loves food, but also life. She's included recipes. I always enjoy books that weave recipes into the stories. I assume that others in the series will have recipes also.",17,2
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Jennifer,350,386,3,"July 20, 2017","""Venice is all our fantasies. Water, light, color, perfume, escape, disguise, license are gold spun and stitched into the skirts she trails across her stones by day and spreads over her lagoon in the never-quite-blackness of her nights.""A short book of love, travel, food, and chance encounters.de Blasi has traveled to Venice many times, and on one of her trips, the day she is scheduled to leave, she meets Fernando, a Venetian who correctly identifies her as a woman he saw during her previous trip (he was too shy to introduce himself then). Not wanting the moment to pass again Fernando asks her to dinner and proclaims his strong connection to her. Fast forward just a few months and de Blasi has sold her home in St. Louis, moved to Venice, and she and Fernando are engaged (according to my Google search they're stil married).This is the type of book to read if you want a diversion and like stories about food, architecture, love, and people who have made dramatic changes in their lives. This is a book with a lot of passion (not anything R-rated, but zest for life and living it to the fullest). The book gets 3 stars because the writing itself wavers between zest and filler. ",13,2
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Andrea,"1,419",12,4,"September 25, 2010",As I have said before there is just something about travel books that draws me in. Ever since I read A Year in Provence I was hooked on the genre. A couple of months ago I read A Thousand Days in Tuscany. Not far into the book I realized that Venice came before Tuscany and I had missed how our lovely couple met and moved to Tuscany. I'm a stickler for reading series in the correct order so I was disturbed that I was going to have to go backward and the story would be ruined. The way de Blasi writes proved that this was not going to be a problem at all. The history of Venice from de Blasi's perspective was very romantic and made the book enjoyable. I look forward to seeing where these two lovebirds settle down next!,13,1 comment
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Mel,191,1 follower,2,"November 7, 2020","The author tells her tale of meeting her husband and moving to Venice. It's a fairytale that romances the process of adapting to a new country. Marlena meets Fernando hours before her flight is scheduled to depart. He follows her back to the US. The only point really shared about his visit to St Louis is that she got the flu while he's there. She decides to sell her newly refurbished home and marry him in Italy. The reader is not given any details on the connection between the two. Frankly, Fernando came off as a bit of a dolt.While there are a few annoyances Marlena encounters for the most part she adapts wonderfully to Italy. Everything is rainbows and lollipops. The writing is dripping in exaggerated prose, ""the market seemed a tiny kingdom in the sky.""""I'm Venetian as much as if I were born here. I'm Venetian, Fernando. I'm more Venetian than you,"" she tells her husband at the end of her thousand nights in Venice. What a crock of crap! I've lived in Italy for 11 years and the thought of telling any Italian I know the culture better than a native is unthinkable. There is nothing realistic about this book. It perpetuates the myth that Italy is a magical land and the reason why some people are disappointed once the reality is experienced. Italy has countless things are wonderful, but there many problems as well. A balanced perspective would have been welcomed.",8,1 comment
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Catherine,663,3,2,"May 8, 2007","This book had a few enjoyable moments, but unfortunately, the dull moments lasted longer. In a nutshell, the book is about a middle-aged Midwestern woman who travels to Venice, meets an Italian man who she spends a couple of days with, then he goes to visit her in St. Louis for two weeks, then she gives up her entire life to move to Venice to marry him. There have been a couple of sequels, so I know this couple are still together, but I don't think I'll bother reading any other books by this author. This book just didn't capture my curiosity to know what happened next.",7,11
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Beth,495,13,4,"November 16, 2011","I was hesitant whether this would be good or not (to me, a memoir is only good if the author has an interesting story to tell, or if they can tell that story in an interesting manner) -- but three things intrigued me: 1) It's about love and chance encounters 2) It's about travel 3) Specifically, it's about Venice, Italy.Overall, I wasn't disappointed. Turns out, the author did have an interesting story to tell, and she told it in a mostly interesting manner. I found some of it to be pretty unbelievable -- that a modern, successful woman would just up and leave everything she had and knew in America (friends, family, businesses) to move to Italy to marry a man she hardly knew (literally, had only spent a handful of days with him). However, I guess that's the romantic part of it - that totally unfathomable piece that some people may dream of - that makes it interesting. I can actually relate somewhat, as I met a Greek man while I was on vacation in Athens a few years ago, and had an almost similar experience. The difference being that after a year of 'being together' (as much as can be possible with a trans-oceanic relationship), I realized that it wasn't meant to be. Sometimes I wonder what would've happened if I had followed through with the relationship. Kudos to the author of this book for throwing caution to the wind and giving it a shot. Whether she was crazy, carefree, or just brave and willing to take chances, who knows -- but what a wonderful experience she seemed to have.I enjoyed reading about Venice itself, as well. It's a magical city and reading this book reminds me that I really want to revisit the city and discover more that it has to offer. It was interesting to see the city through the eyes of an American who has been transplanted there and who has to try and weave herself into the threads of the culture. I also had to laugh at some of the roadblocks she encountered as far as fitting in with the Venetians and their culture and customs, or the bureaucracy in Italy, or just the differences in life between America and Italy. I suppose some people would also enjoy all the references to food (and the recipes in the back), but that didn't really interest me.All in all, a quick, enjoyable read. ",5,1 comment
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Book Concierge,"2,707",325,5,"June 25, 2016","In November 1993 the author arrived in Venice with two friends in tow. As they lunched at a small local place, she noticed a table of four men seated nearby. After all the other patrons had left and she and her friends were alone in the restaurant, the waiter approached and said there was a telephone call for her. “Not possible,” she answered. They had only just arrived that morning and had not yet notified their friends where they were, surely they hadn’t told anyone where they were going for lunch! But the waiter insisted and she went to the phone, to hear a “deep, deliberate, Italian voice I’d never heard before” ask – Is it possible for you to meet me tomorrow at the same time? It’s very important for me.She resisted for several days, but he kept finding her. And when she returned to St Louis, there he was two days later - come across the ocean to insist she return with him to Venice. He was “tired of waiting” for his life to begin, for joy and love to come to him. This is a delicious memoir of a love that surprised these two middle-aged people – a Venetian banker and an American journalist (and chef). I am smiling thinking about it. I kept reading passages aloud to anyone who would listen (and even a few who didn’t want to listen). De Blasi is not only in love with Fernando (“the stranger”), she is in love with Venice. No, she is in love with life, and she imbues her writing with that love. Is it all smooth sailing? Of course not. He lives, and prefers, a Spartan life – simple, small meals, a functional but uninspired and colorless apartment. She is vibrant, wearing “too-red” lipstick, and wanting to surround herself in rich fabrics and deep colors. And, she is a chef – she loves to cook large elaborate meals, to nurture people. Oh, and she isn’t fluent in Italian, much less the Venetian dialect, and he doesn’t speak English. And yet … She held tight to her friend’s advice: “Take it in your hands and hold tight to this love. If it comes, it comes only once.”Read this. And enjoy life!",4,N/A
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Susan,"1,062",200,2,"October 29, 2013","I think I have discovered that memoirs must not be my cup of tea. The authors are just so full of themselves. I guess they'd have to be or they wouldn't be writing about themselves. This author is incredibly full of herself. She lost me when she moved into apartment in Venice and covered her dining room table with damask tied at the bottom to the legs. She said something like she's all about the textiles. Really? Is that the most important thing in your life? Textiles?The author meets her future husband while on vacation in Venice. After spending three hours, that's right three hours, with him, he flies out to meet her in her home of St. Louis. With that short amount of time they decide to get married. She sells everything, house included, and moves to Venice. His apartment is not up to her standards so she renovates in much detail.Here's another thing that got on my nerves. She doesn't write St. Louis like the rest of the world. It's Saint Louis. I know that's petty but it just seemed like an affectation. She also goes on and on about her husband's blueberry eyes. She can't get enough of that phrase.OK, we get it. You like to cook and he has blueberry eyes. Aren't you clever?This is a cross between ""Under the Tuscan Skies"" and ""Eat Pray Love"" and I would have liked it if the author was a little less into herself. Maybe I should just give up memoirs.

87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Chrissie,"2,650",1486,3,"December 11, 2018","Having just finished That Summer in Sicily: A Love Story, I have to add another by this author. This is the first of a trilogy about her marriage with Venetian. I chose this over Amandine: A Novel b/c I believe when authors stick to what lies close to their heart, that is when they write best! But Amandine looks interesting too, so I am a bit undecisive..... I am wondering of this is a typical love story or forigner getting use to a new culture book. You know like the Peter Mayle books. And is there too much emphasis on culinary themes? I hope I don't get drowned with recipes. The text-check was appealing, and I know I like the writing style, but the story behind That Summer in Sicily was so very good. Better subject matter than this I bekieve.",3,2
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Michael Rumney,493,2,2,"November 8, 2018","The account of the Romance between Fernando (AKA the stranger) and the author is quite an odd book. For the first 49 pages nothing much happens, after that a bit more happens and the writing style improves but overall it is still boring.Not very long at 240 pages there is no inciting incident, there are no obstacles for the couple to overcome.There's is nothing exciting about Fernando as he works in a dull bank. The Author you'd think would tell the reader what she sees in her husband. What attracted her to him.She seems to float in an idealistic fairy tale that is Venice, at some point tell us the canals do have a certain disgusting odour. Bring us real life. The only mishaps she seems to have is trying to buy a dress for wedding instead of a wedding dress and moving to Tuscany at the instigation of Fernando, where did that come from I wondered?And as for the recipes that spring up, how dull is it just to read a recipe if you're not interested in doing any cookery? If I wanted a cook book I'd have bought one.",3,N/A
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Patty,68,4,3,"February 3, 2009","I liked this book a lot, although about halfway through it started to feel a little old. What I liked about it was her honesty, and the beautiful glimpse of the life (and challenges!) taking a big risk such as moving to a foreign country and marrying a man of a different culture. But after awhile, the story became a little stale; it became repetitive. I wish she had gone a little deeper into her insights about her new life, but I felt like she became a little repetitive about it; I felt she could have developed the tale further with such rich material. My favorite parts were her descriptions of some of the things that she would do each day in Venice, as well as her observations on the cultural differences between herself and the Venetians. I would give it a 3.5. By the way, it looks like there's great recipes in the back! ",2,2
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Bookmaniac70,507,87,3,"January 20, 2008","I throughly enjoyed this book. It started a bit like a romance novel but Marlena de Blasi writes very inteligently and page after page I discovered something more than that. It`s a really beautiful story about love in a mature age. I loved the light-hearted way of telling it. I was impressed by what she said about the tower of pain-how we accumulate pain and keep it within ourselves to show off. That was exactly the thing she managed to avoid in her story.It sounded fresh and light,as a real new beginning. I am in love with Italy myself having visited it many times (incl.Venice:-)),and it was a pleasure to plunge once again into its unique atmosphere. I liked the witty observations about Italian character and way of life. I would be interested in the sequel.",2,N/A
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Sarah Sammis,"7,127",214,5,"July 19, 2012","Good book. Thank you for letting me borrow the book! I have wanted to read it since I heard a Radio 4 radio play based on the book. If I didn't know a couple who had a similar experience (except that the locations involved were France and California) I would probably be more dismissive of her whirlwind relationship with ""Peter Sellers."" But instead I found myself comparing the ins and outs of their relationship to those details of my parents' friends and nodding knowingly when things matched up. ",2,N/A
87473,A Thousand Days in Venice,Callie Hornbuckle,450,2,3,"July 25, 2019",An autobiographical romance set in Venice - what’s not to like?
