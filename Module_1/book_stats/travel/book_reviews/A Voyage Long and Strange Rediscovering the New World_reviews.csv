2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Brian,671,314,4,"November 18, 2017","Mr. Horwitz's past work has a wonderful knack for combining travel, history, and current culture into a satisfying blend that leaves the reader interested and informed. ""A Voyage Long and Strange"" is not as good as his past efforts, but it is a delightful and informative read none the less.I guess my education was not as bad as the ones lamented by Horwitz in this text because I had a passing familiarity with most of the explorers, conquistadors, etc. that he mentioned. Still, Horwitz developed those stories on a human level, and I enjoyed his exploration of how those long ago expeditions and voyages shape this nation to this very day.A strength of the book is that Horwitz gives credit where credit is due, and does not paint all the conquistadors and explorers as men who raped and pillaged exclusively. He gives them as fair a shake as can be expected in our sensitive modern world, while not glossing over their cruelties and flaws. The people in the past were like us, good and bad mixed together, and Horwitz seems to keep away from the postmodern tenet of judging people by our time and standards.Another great strength of the text is his interviews and adventures with the modern inhabitants of the places that were the quest of the explorers he examines.Love them or hate them, names like Columbus, DeSoto, DeVaca, Coronado, Smith, etc. are names that anyone who wants a real understanding of America's history should be familiar with. This text is a good place to go exploring. You will be entertained and informed.",34,2
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Kiekiat,68,127,3,"May 22, 2019","First, I'd really rate this a 3.5 star book, and perhaps even a four-star. I admit a bias about Tony Horwitz's writing, which perhaps reflects more on my unrealistic expectations of a travel writer than on Tony Horwitz, or perhaps a rush to judgment on my part. The jury is still out, and I will work my way through Horwitz's oeuvre to reach a more nuanced conclusion. Let me say, for now, that based on my previous reading of Horwitz (Confederates in the Attic), I found his writing style bland and felt he lacked the ""zing"" of Sarah Vowel, another historical/travel writer, or the curmudgeonly wit of a Paul Theroux. In 'A Voyage Long and Strange,' Horwitz uses the pretext of his realization that he doesn't know much about the various explorers who ventured to the Americas, especially those before the landing of the pilgrims at Plymouth Rock in 1620. To rectify the holes in his knowledge, Horwitz sets out on various travel expeditions, ranging from Newfoundland to trace the settlements of the Vikings in the 11th Century, onto Coronado's ill-fated journey from Mexico to Kansas in search of ancient lost cities. He also travels to Florida to learn more about the expedition of the restless Hernando DeSoto and makes a stop in Jacksonville in an attempt to research the 1562 settlement there of the French Hugenots. He moves on to North Carolina and gives an interesting account of Sir Walter Raleigh and visits Roanoke Island where in the summer of 1587 a group of British were left to establish a colony and managed to disappear by 1590, one of history's many mysteries as to what exactly happened to the 115 colonists whose relief aid had been delayed by Britain's naval battles with the Spanish in 1588. Horwitz proceeds north to Jamestown, Virginia, home of another famous settlement. This segment has a lot of juicy information about rascally John Smith, the equally knavish Powhatan, and the Pocahontas ""legend,"" Horwitz ends his trip at Plymouth Rock, which, he notes, is much smaller than most Americans realize.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymout...Horwitz's quest for discovery seems to have made him wiser, but more jaded. He notes:""I saw Plymouth through jaundiced eyes, not as the cornerstone of early America, but as its capstone, piled on a cairn erected by all those who came before.""I enjoyed this book and it contained a lot of fascinating tidbits about US history and gave me the urge to learn more. My verdict on Horwitz as a scintillating travel writer is still out, but 'A Voyage Long and Strange' shows Horwitz as a research skilled at digging up those fascinating tidbits of history that, for me at least, make for an interesting book. This will not be my last review of Mr. Horwitz.",29,2
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Howard,318,223,5,"December 5, 2014","Tony Horwitz makes a rather startling confession in his introduction to ""A Voyage Long and Strange."" After viewing the famous rock in Plymouth, Massachusetts, he writes:“I scanned the data stored in my own brain about America’s family of Europeans. ‘In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue’…John Smith and Jamestown…the Mayflower Compact…Pilgrims in funny hats…Of the Indians who met the English, I of course knew Pocahontas, Squanto, and … Hiawatha?“…As far as dates, I’d mislaid an entire century, the one separating Columbus’s sail in 1492 from Jamestown’s founding in 16-0-something. Maybe nothing happened in the period between. Still, it was disturbing not to know. Expensively educated at a private school and university --- [now an even more shocking admission!] – a history major, no less! I’d matriculated to middle age with a third grader’s grasp of early America.”But it gets worse. Horwitz later writes: “…like most Americans, I was ignorant of the Jamestown story, even though I’d spent much of my life in Virginia.” [!!??]His confession reminds me of a story the late Lewis Grizzard used to tell, which ended with the punch line, “Damn brother, I don’t believe I woulda told that.”But Horwitz sets out to fill in the void in his knowledge of early American history and he succeeds admirably. He may have been a poor historian, but he is an outstanding journalist who has traveled the world and been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his work, strange though it may be that he would be so curious about what was happening around the globe, but not be intellectually engaged with what had happened in his own backyard.His book is really a pretense for travel. After extensive research, he writes about that century that he knows nothing about, and then he melds the past and the present by traveling to the areas where the significant events occurred and writes about what he finds there today. So, even if, unlike Horwitz, the reader is familiar with the people and events of that era, the current information will still be worthwhile.Finally, Horwitz entertains the reader with his wit and charm and at the same time provides an opportunity to learn American history in a painless fashion. And after those confessions in his introduction and what he has done about them, I’m sure he now feels better about himself. I would.",28,16
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Christine,"6,526",466,4,"August 19, 2014","	This was an impulse buy. I was at the Smithsonian, the Native American, American Indian, museum, and this was in the bookstore. And since I get like 20% off because I’m a supporter and the cover was interesting, and the start sounded good. 	And I had a really nice lunch.	So I figured what the hell.	And it was one of those times where it worked out. Go figure.	Horowitz travels to discover the discovery of America (at least discovery by white folks, but he’s honest about that part of it). Some of what he covers, a reader of history will now, but his writing makes up for the lapses. Part travelogue, the book also covers people’s reactions to history or to a changing view of history. 	While the focus is largely on the land that makes the US, other parts of the Americas do get the spotlight shown on them. Additionally, the book is not simply the repeating of facts, but also a study of how facts and myths switch places. 	It’s quite a fun read and you will learn quite a bit.",8,N/A
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Kat ❅,829,69,4,"August 29, 2016","I found this book to be very enjoyable. I read this book as extra credit for one of my classes but liked it nonetheless. I really love learning about history but some academic history books can be very dry and boring to read so I like history books like this where it was written for a broad audience. There was a lot of stuff in this book I didn't know but also lots and lots of facts that I did know. This is probably partially because I'm in an American history class right now but some things that the author discovered where he was like ""this is so cool I had no idea this happened!"" I already knew about it and it was less exciting. I would say definitely pick up this book if you are interested in learning more about who the earliest settlers of America were, where the went, what they did, and how they affected the native peoples. Very informative and I pretty interesting read. ",8,N/A
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Elliot,143,19,4,"August 15, 2021","Like many Americans, I was raised on the traditional stories of the Pilgrims and other myths about our nations’ origins. Horwitz evidently received the same sort of education, and after an unintended visit to Plymouth Rock, he was inspired to fill in the gaps in his knowledge. Accordingly, he set off on a journey across North America, venturing to Canada, the Caribbean, and most regions of the United States.Horwitz relates to the reader the stories of the various European expeditions to the New World, starting with the Vikings’ explorations in the north and ending with the English settlements in New England. What makes this book unique is that Horwitz intersperses the historical narrative with tales of his own adventures across the continent. His findings range from interesting to depressing to boring, but what I enjoyed most was reading about the people he found who live at these historical locations. I was amazed at the effect these events from centuries ago play in these peoples’ lives. I think that insight is this book’s biggest strength. There are other books dedicated to the Conquistadors, the tragic demise of native peoples, and all the other stories that Horwitz covers, but none of them show how the history continues to hang over the heads of people across the continent. I didn’t love Horwitz’ writing, but he aims to entertain and he does succeed at that with his casual style. As mentioned above, this isn’t serious history, but it’s a nice introduction to fill in the gaps of and correct the errors of elementary school education.On a personal note, I’ve always been familiar with the names of Spanish and Portuguese Conquistadors and explorers because the street names in my neighborhood are rife with them: Cortez, Cabrillo, Drake, Bernal, Coronado, Diaz, de Soto – just to name a few. I knew the stories of some, but I enjoyed learning about others, particularly Coronado and de Soto. Maybe enjoyed isn’t the right word, since they killed thousands of people, but enlightening, nonetheless.",7,2
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Mike,"1,100",151,4,"July 22, 2018","A Voyage Long and Strange: Rediscovering the New World gets 4 Stars, not for being enjoyable but for being a good read. Horwitz is on a mission to destroy founding myths and rub your nose in the sometimes cruel facts. He succeeds. The focus of the book is from Columbus to the 1620 landing of the Pilgrims. Much of the book is therefore about the Spanish, some French, a couple Portuguese and then the English at the end of the story. When someone bemoans the terrible impact of the “Europeans” on Native Americans, I’m pretty sure the image is meant to call up the white man. However, the author spends the first 2/3rds of the book primarily on the Spanish impact. Living in New Mexico, it is instructive to learn about what happened here, representative of so many other colonies established by Spain. Coronado traveled just north of my home and left an impression: 
  Coronado didn’t record his first impression of Cibola. Instead, he described a curious ritual the Spanish performed outside the pueblo’s walls. Coronado sent several soldiers, a friar, and an Indian interpreter ahead to deliver the edict called the Requerimiento, or Summons. Drafted three decades earlier by a Spanish jurist, the document was part of the Crown’s tortured attempt to define “just war” against Indians: a sort of sixteenth-century Geneva Convention. Conquistadors carried copies of the Requerimiento all over the Americas and were commanded to read it to Indians before commencing battle. The proclamation opened with an abridged history of the world: God’s creation of heaven and earth; Adam and Eve; St. Peter and the papacy. It also explained that the pontiff in Rome had authorized Spain’s claim to the New World, a grant recorded in various documents. “These you may view, if you wish,” the Requerimiento assured its Indian audience. Then came the summons. Natives who peacefully accepted the Spanish Crown as “king and lord” would be welcomed “with complete affection and charity,” and extended many privileges. Indians should pause to consider this generous offer, taking as much time as “is reasonable.” However, if they delayed, or refused to submit, the consequences would be immediate and awful. “I assure you that, with the help of God, I will attack you mightily. I will make war against you everywhere and in every way. . , . I will take your wives and children, and I will make them slaves. . . . I will take your property. I will do all the harm and damage to you that I can.” And further: “I declare that the deaths and injuries that occur as a result of this would be your fault and not His Majesty’s, nor ours.” The document concluded with the chilling legalism of Spanish conquest; a notary, required to be present at the scene, signed an affidavit attesting that the edict had been pronounced. In modern terms, the Spanish thereby affirmed that natives had been read their Miranda rights. In practice, the Requerimiento was more akin to last rites-a death sentence delivered in language Indians couldn’t possibly comprehend, in the name of forces they couldn’t possibly imagine. Who was “God, Our Lord”? The “Pope”? The “exalted and powerful monarch” of a place called Castile and Leon? As if the Requerimiento wasn’t a bald enough sanction for slaughter, it was often read without an interpreter present, or was delivered from a distance of several miles, or uttered at night while Indians slept, unaware of an impending attack. The Dominican friar Bartolomé de Las Casas declared that he didn’t know “whether to laugh or to cry” at the absurdity of the document. 
That Coronado, what a guy! He did have a certain way with the natives:
  …the Spanish took several of their leaders away in chains, including the head of the peace delegation that had come to Zuni. They later set dogs on the prisoners, badly maiming them. “This began,” a soldier wrote, “the want of confidence in the word of the Spaniards whenever there was talk of peace from that time on.” Coronado’s men also aroused fury when they decamped from Zuni and established winter quarters in pueblos along the Rio Grande, near present-day Albuquerque. At first, the inhabitants welcomed the intruders peacefully. And the Spanish wrote admiringly of native men spinning and weaving cloth, women grinding corn while singing to flute music and native pottery of “extraordinary labor and workmanship.” But none of this prevented the cold and hungry Spanish from looting food and blankets, and molesting native women. When Indians retaliated by killing Spanish horses, Coronado ordered his men to “make an example” of the pueblo where the rebels took refuge. A hundred or more Indians were burned at the stake. All along the Rio Grande, natives rose in revolt and fought through the snowy winter. Many hundreds died, and at least a dozen pueblos were destroyed before Coronado achieved what he called la conquista y pacificacion of the region. It was a victory so savage that some of his men began to turn against him. By betraying and brutalizing the peaceful pueblo people, one soldier observed, Coronado had made potential allies into vengeful enemies, “as will be seen by what happened afterward.” 
Toward the end of the 16th Century, another conquistador, Juan de Oñate left his mark on the area. Acoma is just a short distance west from me and I will never overfly it again without remembering the story of what happened there:
  From a distance, Acoma evokes another ancient desert citadel, Masada, to whose history the pueblo’s bears a tragic resemblance. In the half century after Coronado’s men visited, Acoma was a peaceful way station for the occasional Spaniard traveling between Zuni and the Rio Grande. Then, in 1598, a conquistador named Juan de Oñate led four hundred soldiers and settlers north from Mexico to colonize the pueblo country. When Oñate’s nephew visited Acoma at the head of a small party, Indians killed thirteen of them, including one who died while leaping off the mesa. Oñate -a hard-handed man, even by conquistador standards sent a force led by his slain nephew’s brother to exact revenge. Oñate’s orders were explicit'  “Leave no stone on stone, so that the Indians may never be able again to inhabit it as an impregnable fortress.”  The soldiers killed some eight hundred Acomas, a Spaniard wrote, and “the pueblo was completely laid waste and burned.” About six hundred survivors were rounded up and brought before Oñate, who put them on trial, granting them an attorney and the right to testify. Five did so, stating that Oñate’s nephew and his men were killed because of their excessive demands for food and blankets. The Spanish defense attorney asked Oñate to show mercy on the Acomas,  “in view of the fact that they are barbarous”  -an ironic characterization, given the conquistador’s verdict.  “Males who are over twenty-five years of age,” Oñate ruled,  “I sentence to have one foot cut off and to twenty years of personal servitude”  -enslavement to Spanish soldiers. Males between the ages of twelve and twenty-five, and females over twelve, were also enslaved for twenty years. Two Hopis who had joined in the fighting were sentenced to have their right hands cut off and then to be set free,  “in order that they may convey to their land the news of this punishment.”  As a further warning to natives, the amputations of hands and feet were carried out in public, on different days and at different pueblos.
De Soto was another explorer/conquistador/adventurer with a drive to find his fortune. Horwitz reveals these and other people who landed in America as both ruthless and cruel while also admiring their drive and toughness. The final third of the book brings the English into the picture. England had an early peek into the New World but was not in a position to make an effort to colonize. England also had a long record of futility when it came to exploring the New World. In 1496, four years after Columbus’s first sail, another Italian navigator, John Cabot, won a license from King Henry VII to “seeke out, discover and finde” new lands. Cabot reached Newfoundland the next year but barely ventured ashore, discovering only some animal dung and a fishing snare. He gave the snare to King Henry, who dispatched Cabot on a second voyage to America. The mariner never returned. “He is believed to have found the new lands nowhere but on the very bottom of the ocean,” a contemporary observed. By the start of the 17th Century, England begins to stake a claim to new colonies in present day North Carolina and Virginia.In 1602, a party of English built a fort on the island of Cuttyhunk. They came, not for religious freedom, but to get rich from digging sassafras, a commodity prized in Europe as a cure for the clap. The Pilgrims who arrived in Massachusetts eighteen years later had a very different experience. Samoset, the first Indian they met at Plymouth, greeted the settlers in English. The first thing he asked for was beer.Worth the time to read, full of interesting facts but not exactly pleasant.",6,N/A
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Jarrod,393,14,1,"April 21, 2017","This book has some bright spots, but is terribly difficult to get through in others. He's rambling about local joints and what he's doing and absurd conversations when I want to know about the dealings of Columbus, Coronado, De Soto, Cortez and others. Oh, and leave your bullshit liberal tendencies at home or wherever it is that dumbasses follow that drivel of thought. I almost quit the book at ""Gluttony and guilt: constant bedfellows in the Bible Belt South"". Completely unnecessary.He talks vaguely about Cortez (probably the biggest Conquistador) and his conquest of Mexico and the Mexica (Aztecs). He belittles this to one paragraph and basically says ""he slaughtered them"". Anyone that's read the accounts - I recommend Hugh Thomas' Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico account - knows it was much more complex than this. Instead we are left to wonder while he tells of accounts of his plodding through Cuba and New Mexico / Texas and Kansas and his lame interactions with the locals. He also likes to belittle them and speaks condescending to them ""But is this a Viking convention or something?"". Skip this one and move on to something substantive where personal judgments aren't made.He spends way too much time belittling Columbus and speaking of his failures instead of giving the actual history of what happened. The third voyage of him (the most famous) is barely presented and you'd never know the routes that Columbus found to the new world were basically mimic by every ship from Europe to America for the next 300 years. You'd never know this because he's too busy telling you about stupid local customs of a land where the inhabitants have neglected it and left it to ruin except for tourism purposes. Garbage really. No mention of Bobadilla at all. None. It's obvious the author has a problem with Columbus and fails to mention or give credit to his accomplishments to history. Without him, none of us are here. If you want to read about Columbus I suggest Columbus: The Four Voyages. A little over half-way through the book and I'm seriously contemplating moving on to a better issue of exploration and conquest. I will definitely pick up other accounts of Coronado, De Soto and De Leon. With what I know is missing from Columbus and Cortez, I can only suspect the other accounts are missing significant details as well. Pass this one up. Disappointed to say the least.I did finish the book. Wouldn't recommend it to be honest. The end was just trash because he promotes subscribing to the myth rather than the fact because it's ""nicer"" to paraphrase. Dive into the actual history and study what happened. Skip this garbage.",5,3

To shed light on the American ""Dark Ages,"" Tony Horwitz follows the trails, literally by car, blazed by the Vikings, Spanish, French and English explorers and exploiters. He is a very entertaining writer with a touch of sarcasm that is used to debunk the myths we were taught in school.I liked how he hit the road and dug up folks along the sixteenth century explorers' routes to add a human touch to what has always been just the rote history of our youth. He particularly went out of his way, often way out, to connect with those people who could tell the story of those who were exploited, dispossessed and just plain murdered by direct and indirect means.I am puzzled, however, that he made absolutely no mention of the Dutch who settled New Amsterdam six years before the Mayflower unloaded its stiff collared cargo. A glaring omission in my mind of an otherwise thoroughly researched and entertaining history. ",5,2

Told in much the same way, i.e., interspersing dollops of grim and sometimes ridiculous historical events with interviews of current residents of the historical venues. Sometimes the current goings on are at least as crazy as the historical ones. But Horwitz' easy manner and ability to paint the historical picture with a jaundiced (if non-judgemental) eye serves the story well. Certainly the reader will have no illusions about the clay feet of the various historical figures as well as those today who try to mold the truth to fit their own agenda. A worthwhile read.",5,N/A
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Lauren ,"1,679",2290,4,"July 15, 2009","Tony Horwtiz's style really appeals to me - I like his ""gung ho"" approach of reporting. It totally worked in Confederates in the Attic and in Blue Latitudes. I heard about this book before its release in 2007. I was visiting the Jamestown settlement in Virginia and overheard a conversation about how Horwitz had been there doing some research for his new book. I knew he was living in Virginia at the time, so it didn't come as a big surprise, and the timing was right, since Jamestown celebrated its 400th anniverary in 2007. When this book hit the market, I immediately added it to the queue and picked it up at the bookstore a few weeks later. The premise of the book is a little jab at the American education system - the misinformation and the general laziness of historical education at the primary and secondary levels. Of course the educators alone are not at fault, but a general public who believe that Columbus landed at Plymouth, Massachusetts, or that the pilgrims were at Jamestown. Dates and geography forgotten so easily... and Horwitz wants to fill in those gaps.He sets out on this quest first by researching the *many* explorations through North America and the Caribbean by the host of imperial European powers. He starts with Columbus, and travels to the Dominican Republic and searches for signs of the explorer in the modern day country. This is his modus operandi for the book: go to the modern country/region/state, and look for signs of the past. He relies on several archival resources, but he really just likes to talk to people. So, he goes into museums, into bars, into public parks, and just talks to people. It's a kind of guerilla approach, but he shares some interesting anecdotes and meets many unique characters.There were a few dry spells in the book, and I freely admit to skipping over some portions and starting on the next chapter/region. The chapters on the Southwest took me back to my New Mexico history class in middle school - we did learn many of the same things, so it was good to revisit. My favorite chapters in the book were the stories of the explorations in the southeast by the Spanish and the French - perhaps it is because I knew the least about that region's history, or because the stories were so enticing.Horwitz does not cover completely unexplored territory here (to keep with the theme!) but he does it in a fun and readable way. The general idea is similar to Loewen's Lies My Teacher Told Me. One criticism that I had while reading this book - and I understand that we just don't have the documentation to truly ""back up"" the other party's experience - it all seemed so Euro-centric. I couldn't help but think that the book needed a little dose of Zinn's People's History... added to the mix for more palpability.That being said, I enjoyed it and learned some great little tidbits. While reading, I felt the need to share said tidbits with family and friends :)",4,1 comment
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Mike,1,1 follower,4,"July 30, 2008","In this work Horwitz fills in the gaping chasm of knowledge we have regarding the exploration of North America by Europeans. Columbus' first landing on his first (of four) voyages WAS incredibly important. So were excursions by the Erikson family, de Leon, da Vaca, Coronado, de Soto and a host of others. Any person with a shred of interest in American history MUST read this book. Like all Horwitz' work, it is carefully researched and winningly told. He employs his customary method of telling first an historical narrative and then of his own travels through the same territory. He shares his insights into human nature with wry and gentle humor. He teaches history with passion. I think I would love to share a couple of beers with Tony Horwitz in any of the hundreds of places he has taken me in the half-dozen or so of his books I have read.I know American history. That is, I know the history of what now goes by the name of the U.S.A. from the years 1620 to the present. I actually have a minor in Colonial History from a major University. I confess that I knew virtually nothing more than the names of the incredible people who populate A Voyage Long and Strange. They deserve to be known. A few episodes from Horwitz' book that I hope might tease others into reading the whole of it:The Spanish soldier who, having reached the center of today's Kansas after an epic journey under Coronado from central Mexico, wrote in his diary of laying down on the grass of the Great Plains and losing all sense of being in a space that had any limits at all.The beautiful Lady of Cofitachequi (in today's North Carolina), who greeted de Soto and his men by standing naked in a canoe oared across a river by her servant men.The precise spot Erikson and company spent a summer Newfoundland more than a thousand years ago. (It was surprising to me that archeologists agree on this site without reservation.)Da Vaca's account of drifting, starving, in a raft across the Gulf Coast and crossing the mouth of the Mississippi.The desperate and sad attempts of the modern Dominican Republic's government to generate tourist revenue through the promotion of their long list of ""firsts"" (first surviving European town in the hemisphere, first school, first hospital, first baby born to a European woman, etc.)Mike Rigginsmike@northernlakescc.org",4,2
2076722,A Voyage Long and Strange Rediscovering the New World,Michael VanZandt,70,6,2,"September 3, 2009","I came to this book full of expectations and intrigue, after Horwitz's phenomenal pop-historical jaunt through the weirdness of neo-Confederate headlines and Dixie locales in ""Confederates in the Attic."" The subject of public memory, as its predecessor, is also a topic near and dear to my heart. Reared on James Louwen's ""Lies My Teacher Told Me"", I was ready to embark full-hearted on a cross-country romp through the misstated facts of American civil mythology. Closing the book for the last time, I felt dissatisfied.Horwitz has an affable, casual nature to his writing style that eliminates from academic scrutiny. It's clearly not intended for that forum. All of his books are casual reads in the mode of Bill Bryson. Do not be fooled; he does his earnest research and aims to enlighten the reader while unraveling an entertaining tale.Much of what prevents ""A Voyage"" from becoming the poignant analysis that ""Confederates"" was is not so much the author but the subject. ""Confederates"" was such an intriguing read precisely because the Civil War is a uniquely Southern experience which is lived out through current events and the 10 o'clock news nearly a century and a half after its conclusion. For many, that war still remains a primary aspect of American identity, whether African-American, Southern, or the rare Yankee Union-enthusiast. Each chapter provided a snapshot of how the War still lives on. It's far more likely to come across a disillusioned Daughter of the Confederacy than it is a Powhatan Indian these days. Horwitz excels at blending the history with the memory of his contemporaries. In this subject, he clearly has much less with which to work. In ""Voyage"", I felt like a conscripted Spanish soldier on a forced march through the stories. Horwitz writes each Spanish trek with as much enthusiasm. In the end, the histories and story-telling lose the vitality that Horwitz had captured in his previous work. The topic itself is one that numbs the reader. Whelp, the Spanish conquistador pillaged another indigenous village; more Indians died from an introduced disease; etc, etc. Horwitz's gavel -- his firm conclusion -- only comes in the closing paragraphs, all the pages beforehand equated to the wasteland that Estevanico faced (actually, very cool story which should be taught). Lost were the themes and imagery which he deftly wove into ""Confederates.""Perhaps, it's unfair to compare ""Voyage"" with his earlier book. Rarely does it provide the insight that one can find in other works. In its own right though this is an enjoyable read that may give one a greater appreciation for pre-Mayflower history on the U.S. continent.",3,N/A

He decides to embark on a journey back in time, exploring sites in the Americas pertinent to European colonization before 1620. In his travels, he explores the Dominican Republic, where Columbus landed in 1492, retraces the path of Hernando de Soto through what is now the southeastern US, and visits sites in the Southwest that Cabeza de Vaca explored. He spends time in St. Augustine, FL, site of the first permanent European settlement within the boundaries of the US, tours Roanoke Island, NC, site of the Lost Colony, and explores the archaeological site at Jamestown, VA. The book is mostly a travelogue interspersed with history about the places he visits. It's a fun way to learn about these sites if you want a break from a more scholarly read.",2,N/A
