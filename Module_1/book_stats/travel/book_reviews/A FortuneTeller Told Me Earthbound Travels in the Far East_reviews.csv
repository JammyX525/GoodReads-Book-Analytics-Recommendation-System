326931,A FortuneTeller Told Me Earthbound Travels in the Far East,Mike S,384,34,5,"February 13, 2009","This book is very well written. I really like the author, he has a very easy-going and readable style; he's articulate, intelligent, observant, and deeply reflective. Whether you are interested his adventures in Asian countries and his thoughts on their cultural developments and how the west has impacted them, or his metaphysical musings and some surprising personal experiences as he searches out mystics, psychics, and fortune tellers, this books is a pleasure to read because the author is able to slow down and really absorb the atmosphere wherever he happens to be, then reflect on it and communicate the experience so well that it's easy to imagine I'm there. I lived in Asia for 11 mo's in 2000 and his book took me right back as if it was yesterday. I enjoyed the book so much I searched for the authors home page to write and thank him for the book, and I was very sad to find that he passed away. There's a really good obit here:http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/...",16,1 comment
326931,A FortuneTeller Told Me Earthbound Travels in the Far East,Diane S â˜”,"4,686",1400,4,"March 4, 2015","A while back I read a book, that made a huge impression on me, it highlighted the native American culture and how so much of it is disappearing. This book in many ways resembles that one, though the location is very different, a look at the disappearing Asian primitive landscape, it being overtaken and changes through progress.This is also, a book that I had never heard of nor probably picked up if it wasn't a recommendation pick from a group I am in. It covers so much ground, different beliefs and cultures, old ways versus the new changing ways. As the author points out progress carries a huge price. Loved learning about their belief systems, their traditions and superstitions. The author was a journalist and he writes very clearly and well, his opinions are ones that I share. He actually lived in these countries, not just stopped in to report. He visited people, fortune-teller and other spiritual entities native to whatever country he was living in. So another book that made a huge impression on me, one I won't soon forget. Glad I bought it because I can take the time to re-read whenever I feel the urge, and I have no doubt I will.",15,3
326931,A FortuneTeller Told Me Earthbound Travels in the Far East,Elisabetta,371,11,5,"May 12, 2010","I read this book slowly at the beginning. Slowly like the travels Tiziano makes through Asia. When he decides to follow what a fortune telle told him years before in Hong Kong, maybe he couldn't imagine how travels can change when you decide not taking a plane for a whole year, and keep on working as a journalist in Asia. This is a lovely book. Tiziano was a real traveller, not a tourist at all. He describes the bad and good part of every country he visits, but he never complains like tourist sometimes do. He meets so many people and it's nice to see its path through different fortune tellers :)",6,N/A
326931,A FortuneTeller Told Me Earthbound Travels in the Far East,Amy Hannon,13,5,5,"June 27, 2008","I loved this book. It is the haunting story of a middle aged Italian journalist from Florence whose lifelong beat has been Asia. He has lived and worked there most of his life and watched it go through wars and ""development."" In 1976 a fortune teller in Hong Kong tells him that he will die in a plane crash in 1993 so he shouldn't fly that year. It's a long way off but years pass and when 1993 comes, now in his late 50's Tiziano Terzani decides he will organize his ongoing work so that he can go everywhere by land or sea, but not by air. This provides him a whole different perspective on places witha far more human scale and sets the stage for his ongoing reflections on the degradations to culture and soul brought about by ""modernization"" throughout the East.He is skeptical of his own gullibility with regard to the soothsayer's prediction so decides to make a study of fortune tellers everywhere he goes. Travelling at a slow pace and willing to go out of his way for days to reach the famous astrologer on the hill, or the local wise man, we see him encounter a variety of people who are more or less gifted with the ability to read omens -- palms, horoscopes, tea leaves and more. Terzani never quite loses his skepticism but his appreciation of traditional modes of life and thought only deepens throughout the book until you are caught up with him in a sense of inestimable loss brought about by the quest for money and western ways that is more successful in destroying cultures and ecosystems than any army.It's a travelogue and documentary but reads like a novel.6/26/08",3,N/A
