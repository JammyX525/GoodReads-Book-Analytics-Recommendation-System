Richards and Alice A. Robinson. He was baptized June 11, 1894, and filled two missions to the Netherlands, the first one in 1905-1908. On his second mission, from 1914 to 1916, —when he presided—he was accompanied by his wife, Ina Jane Ashton Richards, who was born Sept. 14, 1886, at Salt Lake City, a daughter of Edward T. Ashton and Cora Lindsay and by whom he would father ten children. Elder Richards was ordained a High Priest and Bishop June 29, 1919, by Charles W. Penrose, and presided over the Sugar House Ward, Granite Stake, from 1920 to 1925.  In 1926 he filled a short term mission to the Eastern States. In 1931-1933 he presided over the Hollywood Stake, California, and was set apart Dec. 29, 1933, to preside over the Southern States Mission. (See Improvement Era, Vol. 17, p. 250.) Elder Richards was called as the Presiding Bishop of the Church April 6, 1938, suceeding Sylvester Q. Cannon who had been called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He served in that position until April 6, 1952 when he was suceeded by Joseph Leopold Wirthlin, he himself having been called to follow Elder Cannon into the Quorum of the Twelve and being ordained to this high and holy office by President David O. McKay on the same April 6, 1952.  Elder Richards served in the Council of the Twelve until his death January 11, 1983 in Salt Lake City, Utah at the age of ninety-six.",12,20,155,9128,"['5378 (58%)', '2232 (24%)', '996 (10%)', '255 (2%)', '267 (2%)']"
