164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Stephen,"1,517",10800,5,"September 21, 2011","Odd as it sounds, this is hot toddy, warm blanket comfort food for me. Admittedly, that’s not the typical description of this cynical, bleak-themed, post-apocalyptic SF classic. However, the easy, breezy style with which Miller explores his melancholy material manages to pluck smiles from me whenever I pick it up. This go around, I listened to the audio version which was recently released it was as mood brightening an experience as my previous read through.Despite dealing with dark, somber subject matter and ultimately ending on a tragic crescendo of “humanity is stupid, savage and screwed,” the journey of the novel is so filled with engaging characters and genuine humor that the surrounding depression and moroseness of the narrative theme just can’t seem to grab hold of you. At least, it never laid an accusing finger on me. Canticle is broken up into 3 Sections, each taking place approximately 6 centuries apart. Beginning in the 26th century, 600 years after the Flame Deluge when nuclear buffoonery laid waste to civilization, the central focus of the story is a Roman Catholic monastery founded by a Jewish weapons engineer for the purpose of safeguarding and preserving human knowledge. Shortly after the geniuses of the 20th Century decided to light up the globe like Hell's own 4th of July, the surviving residents of Planet “radiation burn” decided that brains and books were overrated and followed up the Flame Deluge with the Simplification, whereby they roasted all of the books (along with any person smart enough to read or write one). Isaac Leibowitz, after being part of the military machinery that microwaved the planet, made it his mission in life to try and preserve knowledge for the future. Thus the Albertian Order of Leibowitz was founded. The first third of the book introduces us to the post apocalyptic world and gives a back-story on the Flame Deluge and the mission of the Order of Leibowitz. Located in what was the Southwestern United States, the Order tracks down and smuggles 20th century “memorabilia” into the abbey (a process known as “booklegging”) while trying to avoid being killed (and possibly eaten) by the self-described “Simpletons” roaming the wastelands. The next section of the book takes place in the 32nd Century and shows humanity finally emerging out of the dark ages of the Simplification and beginning to once again embrace the knowledge. This section focuses primarily on the growing feud between the resurgent secular scientists and the Church over the control and distribution of technology. Similar to our own renaissance period, the story describes science and natural law going toe-to-toe with the info hoarding monks as powerful city-states run by warlords play both sides for advantage. Finally, in the 38th Century, the last section of the book shows humanity once again in the full flower of its technological brilliance and historical stupidity ready to give the Earth another nuclear facial (Note:I was going to use ""atomic facial,"" but the Urban Dictionary makes that term very inappropriate here). War is coming and the forces of history are once again driving humanity like cattle towards the abattoir. Thus we see the overarching theme of Miller’s masterpiece; the cyclical nature of history. 
  Miller’s moral
: as a species we are too stupid not to truly learn from our past blunders and are doomed to continue to screw the pooch and the planet with our giant, atomic phalluses. I know, not exactly a cheery, pump it up pep talk. However, the tone and the narrative style are anything but dreary. Miller does a wonderful job creating a world that is large and mysterious and yet instantly recognizable and relatable. His characters are flawed, genuine and mostly decent and live through their times with a sense of purpose and optimism that belies the smothering embrace of history as it squeezes events into an all too familiar pattern. Miller’s ability to write brightly of such bleakness is truly extraordinary. The story is dark, fatalistic and filled with pessimism yet the prose is light, hopeful and filled with optimism. The word bitter never comes to mind.  In addition to the overriding theme of history’s wheel-like pattern, Miller touches on other serious issues such as euthanasia and the right to life, the place of art in society and the nature of war itself. This is a towering science fiction work, but Miller’s messages are deftly delivered behind a humorous, engaging future history. In sum, this book is a light touch of morale outrage. It’s a cozy warning of man’s stupidity. It’s a warm, comforting “blankie” for our inner cynic to snuggle with while we wait for the shoe/anvil to drop. Enjoy!! 5.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! Winner: Hugo Award Best Science Fiction Novel (1961)",236,34
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Lyn,"1,845",16300,4,"March 10, 2019","Brilliant. A centuries old story following the evolving world after an apocalypse and centered on the monks of St. Leibowitz, somewhere in the American southwest. The monks keep ancient artifacts of science and technology. Funny, sad, brutal, irreverent at times, but doggedly hopeful in its underlying themes, this is a science fiction gem but really transcends the genre to make a greater statement. Scholars and critics have explored the many themes encompassed in the novel, frequently focusing on its motifs of religion, recurrence, and church versus state. Miller also uses some recurring elements to help bind the stories together, demonstrating exceptional imagination and virtuosity.Miller has crafted a very good book, enjoyable for any science fiction fan and a well written work of fiction besides.",174,21
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Ted,180,84,2,"July 2, 2008","I read this immediately following another well-known 1950s apocalyptic / nuclear holocaust novel ""Alas, Babylon."" That book, which I gave 4 stars to, was an excellent story and made no pretensions to literature; its prose was plain and transparent. The novel in question, ""A Canticle for Leibowitz,"" turned out to be one of the most irritating kinds of genre sci-fi: one with ambitions to beauty and importance that falls far short of the mark.Now, I hate to put it that way, because I would never criticize anyone for trying. But this is one of those genre novels that somehow attained notoriety for being a step closer to literature than the typical pap, and if we're going to talk about it on that level, I have a lot to criticize it for.The story is vague, confusing, unfocused, and seems to have some half-baked theme about religious (""objective"") morality versus cultural (""subjective"") morality. I mean, if it actually had something cogent to say, I would find it more interesting whether or not I agreed with it. But instead, this is another long-winded fiction novel that ambiguously proposes ""questions"" or moral opinions without enough plot or character to make it interesting.The novel started off OK, and the general premise seemed interesting enough: the future history of man hundreds and thousands of years after a nuclear holocaust. I can understand the importance and relevance in a time when holocaust loomed large--and I'm not saying that threat has ceased to exist--and it's likely that the story influenced many minds on the epic horror that such a disaster would wreak on humanity. But the novel as written doesn't do justice to the scope he sets out to tackle.",112,23
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,MISS Petra to you!  Say yes ma'am,"2,383",33900,5,"June 1, 2015","I am very cross. This is yet another book that I rated and reviewed and has disappeared from my shelves. I wonder if it happened when some librarian decided to add series information to it and thereby change the title? If it is no. 1 in a series there has to be a no. 2. There isn't. It isn't a series.

164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Stuart,700,259,3,"February 6, 2017","A Canticle for Leibowitz: Are we doomed to destroy ourselves time after time?(Listened to the audiobook since so many readers disagreed with my view. Lengthy comments at Fantasy Literature)This 1959 Hugo-winning SF classic is certainly an odd fish in the genre. It’s central character is the Order of Saint Leibowitz that survives after the nuclear holocaust (the Flame Deluge), and the story spans over a thousand years as humanity seems determined to repeat its mistakes and destroy itself over and over, with the help of science and technology, while this small group of monks strives to preserve ancient knowledge amid the collapse of civilization.Many readers consider this book a powerful cautionary tale warning against nuclear conflict and the dangers of science. It is certainly well-written, and there are many light-hearted moments in the monks’ lives that bely the serious moral themes of the story. The first part of the book, “Fiat Homo” (Let There Be Man), is the best in my opinion, the story of the small abbey in the American Southwest desert dedicated to Isaac Leibowitz, an engineer who secretly preserved books and knowledge and was martyred in the backlash against science following the Flame Deluge. A young novice Brother Francis discovers an ancient fallout shelter that contains many relics that may have belonged to Leibowitz himself. This discovery causes an uproar as it may interfere with the canonization process of Leibowitz, and results in New Rome sending investigators to examine the relics, and eventually Brother Francis himself is sent to convey these relics to New Rome and present them to the Pope. He encounters a number of setbacks along the way, but manages to make it to New Rome. He learns something of the power structure of the Church, and is tasked with returning to retrieve something that was taken by thieves, but again things don’t work out as planned. The ending of this story is both tragic and ironic.The second part “Fiat Lux” (Let There Be Light) takes place over five centuries later, as the Albertian Order of Saint Leibowitz continues to preserve the various pre-Deluge documents, although they are poorly understood. In the 32nd century, mankind is just starting to rediscover scientific knowledge, and the story revolves around Thon Taddeo, a secular scholar who is intensely interested in the relics and other knowledge preserved by the abbey of St. Leibowitz. He asks the abbey to pass the Memorabilia to his care in the city-state of Texarkana, which is ruled by the ambitious Hannegan. The abbey refuses, insisting that Taddeo come to study them. Reluctantly he agrees to come and meets Brother Kornhoer, who has independently developed a treadmill-powered electrical generator to power a lamp. This is one of the funniest images, of a group of sweating monks pumping away at the generator to provide enough electrical light for Thon Taddeo to study documents in the library. The clash in attitudes between the knowledge-hungry Taddeo and the innocent scientific experiments of the monks forms the main part of the narrative, but the remainder features all the political scheming of Hannegan to dominate the surrounding city-states by playing them against each other. These political machinations were tedious and distracted from the story of Taddeo and the monks.The third part ""Fiat Voluntas Tua"" (Let Thy Will Be Done) I disliked intensely and it negatively affected my view of the whole book. Again we move forward six centuries and mankind has again developed advanced technology including spaceships, colonies on other planets, and nuclear weapons. The world is dominated by two superpowers, the Asian Coalition and the Atlantic Confederacy, who have locked in a cold war for many decades. This time our main characters are abbot Dom Zerchi, who recommends to New Rome that the Church put into motion a secret plan to send a group of priests into space to carry on the mission of the Church in case the world is destroyed again by nuclear conflict, and Brother Joshua, the man tapped to lead this mission. As tensions rise a limited nuclear exchange occurs, producing thousands of fallout victims. Many of these are taken into the abbey of Dom Zerchi, who has a heated debate on euthanasia with a secular doctor treating the refugees, who insists that it is more merciful to administer death to those suffering from fatal dosages, while Dom Zerchi refuses to go along with this, insisting that lives are sacred even when there is no hope, regardless of the physical suffering. His attitude really upset me, since I strongly sympathized with the doctor’s position and couldn’t understand the religious arguments against euthanasia. The three sections of the novel each mirror separate stages of our own history, with “Fiat Homo” showing the Church preserving knowledge even as society falls into chaos and savagery. In “Fiat Lux” we see the rebirth of knowledge and culture, and in “Fiat Voluntas Tua” we see developments akin to our current world, with an adulation of material wealth and technology, along with a decline in spiritual belief. A Canticle of Leibowitz certainly is a skillful depiction of the cyclical nature of history, as humanity grows in knowledge and technology, only to overreach itself and destroy what has been so carefully built up. However, despite the undeniably ingenious structure of the stories and skillful writing, I strongly disagreed with the ideas and conclusions of the author. First of all, I do not buy the image of the Catholic Church as the last protector and repository of science and knowledge as secular society crumbles around it. It’s ironic that the book lovingly describes the noble efforts of these selfless monks to preserve civilization for millenia, but is that the role played by the Church in Europe over the last dozen centuries? When I first posted my initial review of Canticle on Fantasy Literature, I got a spirited response with a lot of dissenting opinions, specifically that I did not understand the Catholic Church’s role in the history of Europe, and I’ll be the first to admit that I am fairly ignorant in that area. While I am aware that the Church and monasteries have preserved many kinds of knowledge for centuries, is that not a very selective process in which any ideas that were opposed to Catholic ideology were expunged? Has the Church not repeatedly challenged and suppressed critics of its policies and positions? Does the author seriously suggest the Church has always been firmly on the side of wisdom and intellectual freedom, whereas science and technology have done more harm than good? Perhaps he conveniently forgot about Galileo and Copernicus, not to mention the shameful atrocities committed during the Crusades and Inquisitions, and by the Conquistadors?Another important point raised by other readers was that I should make a distinction between the Catholic Church and Christianity in general, as although the Church may claim to be the only legitimate church of Christ, there is a whole other world of Protestants who pursue their faith in a different way, without all the sacraments, Eucharist, confessionals, and most importantly, without any Roman Papacy dictating what people should believe. I am an atheist without any attraction to religion, but I would be far more receptive to the Protestant belief in a direct relationship with God than having to go through some intermediary in order to be baptized and avoid burning in the fires of Hell. That’s just ridiculous, as far as I’m concerned.So for me I was turned off by its anti-science, pro-Catholic agenda. Or was he contrasting individual belief with organized religion? The various monks in Canticle are depicted in a very sympathetic light, while secular governments and politicians are shown as power-hungry and destined to bring mankind to destruction amid nuclear holocaust. Does that mean we should abandon secular government in favor of religious rule? Would anyone in their right mind want either the Roman Catholic Church or any of the Islamic states to have control of our affairs? I’d rather be dead and gone before that comes to pass.That’s what makes this book so confounding. The author seems to have a very dark and despairing view of mankind’s inability to avoid destroying itself, which was a very topical subject when it was written during the Cold War, but grafting on this story of Catholic monks valiantly protecting the flame of knowledge in a post-apocalyptic future just didn’t work for me at all. I can agree with the author that science always presents the dangers of wielding powers that can destroy us, but it is up to ourselves (not a divine being who, even if it does exist, is obviously indifferent to our sordid affairs after that brilliant moment of initial creation) to harness science to positive use. Whether our current materialism is due to a lack of spirituality is certainly a valid debate, but for me I seek beauty in the natural world, and find much to admire in human endeavors, not the least of which are literature and art, and much to despise as well. But I choose not to seek betterment through religions. I like the approach of Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein, who both have found a form of spirituality in their observations of our incredible universe and the quantum world, both of which produce an awe in me that could be viewed as spiritual. There are an infinite number of future outcomes for global civilization, but the events of Canticle do not strike me as plausible. I would highly recommend Edgar Pangborn's Davy as a counter-argument to this viewpoint. Neal Stephenson’s Anathem is also a very different take on this, with learned monks surviving many millennia into the future preserving knowledge, but with the twist of mostly being dedicated to science and mathematics rather than religion. In fact, I see an extremely interesting discussion arising from a comparison of A Canticle for Leibowitz and Anathem, which means I better read Anathem to the end and write a comparison review. That could easily become a doctoral thesis, no?Does anyone out there really expect the current religions of the world to lead mankind to greater peace and prosperity in the coming centuries and millennia? I for one do not, though the majority of the human race still claims membership with organized religions. Science and technology are only as beneficial as those who control them, so responsibility for their use lies completely in our hands. Considering that we have managed to survive for almost 70 years since the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we’ve done remarkably well despite the legitimate fears of a generation of SF writers. Our current world faces a host of problems, including environmental destruction, overpopulation, and most tellingly continued religious conflicts (mainly involving Christianity, Islam, and Judaism), but we have certainly avoided the most egregious scenarios imagined by writers after WWII. As it stands now, the biggest threat to humanity's future is named Donald J. Trump.",74,24
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,J.L.   Sutton,651,825,5,"February 20, 2018","Walter Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz is imaginative and thought-provoking. I enjoyed reading it and enjoyed it even more during a second go. While this work has very little in common with Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series (in terms of setting or character or even plot), I kept being reminded of Asimov's classic. Miller presents a primitive post apocalyptic world in which knowledge has been stowed away in a monastery (in what used to be Utah). This monastery might not be the far end of the universe, but in the context of the three interconnected stories which form Canticle it may as well be. This is a time, at least in the first tale, in which the earlier era of learning and much of the knowledge of the war itself is lost. Gaining understanding from this storehouse is no easy feat. Despite a number of centuries separating each of the three stories, Miller links the stories (and advancements in learning) in an interesting way; this in turn pushes the narrative forward in a sort of cyclical history. What Miller is suggesting by this repeated history is both disturbing and ambiguous; however, the increasingly dark humor he attaches to the narrative somehow also makes it quite entertaining. 4.5 Stars.

164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Apatt,507,751,4,"July 14, 2016","“Have we no choice but to play the Phoenix in an unending sequence of rise and fall?Are we doomed to it, Lord, chained to the pendulum of our own mad clockwork, helpless to halt its swing?”Looks like we are, at least according to Walter M. Miller Jr.A Canticle for Leibowitz is a bona fide sci-fi classic, you'd be hard pressed to find a list of “all-time great sci-fi novels” without it. I remember being given a copy of this book in my teens when I was starting to become a serious sci-fi fan. I was quite intrigued by the first few pages but soon found myself unable to maintain my interest in the narrative, due to the complex prose and my inability—at the time—to appreciate the nuances. The likes of Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein were much more accessible for me at the time. I gave “Canticle” up around page 50 and today I spotted some grey hairs on my head (just a few you know) and thought “Aha! Perhaps I’m ready for Leibowitz now!”It is not hard to see why A Canticle for Leibowitz is generally regarded as a sci-fi classic, it is so rich with themes and nuances and leaves you with much to ponder after finishing it. Whether it is fun to read is another matter. Does fiction even need to be fun? That would be up to the reader I guess. Certainly in the subgenre of post-apocalypse fiction it is one of the greats, but if you are looking for something like  The Hunger Games you'd be barking up the wrong tree. This book is as non-YA as you can get.The novel is made up of three interconnected novellas, each one set 600 years apart.1. “Fiat Homo” (Let There Be Man)This first part of A Canticle for Leibowitz is set in America 600 years after a global nuclear apocalypse. The world is in a primitive state and technology is the stuff of legend. A hapless young monk Brother Francis meets a mysterious “pilgrim with girded loins” who leads him to discovery of an underground fallout shelter container documents and memos from the 20th century, some of these were ostensibly written by Isaac Edward Leibowitz, the founder of the monastic “Albertian Order of Leibowitz” to which Brother Francis belongs. This caused a sensation and eventually leads to the Church’s canonization of Saint Leibowitz.2. “Fiat Lux”  (Let There Be Light)Set 600 years after the events of “Fiat Homo”. Scientific (re)discoveries are just beginning, much of it is based on the notes by Isaac Leibowitz. Various tribes are also beginning to make war3. “Fiat Voluntas Tua” (Let Thy Will Be Done)Again 600 years since the previous story. Now civilization is back in full swing, the level of tech is actually more advanced than the previous pre-apocalypse one; humanity has achieved interstellar travel by this time. Unfortunately, the more things change the more they stay the same, so the cyclical nature of human history means that we are once again about to blow each other up. Charmingly ""on the nose"" book cover.All three parts feature a different protagonist (as they are 600 years apart). All three are members of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz. Of the three Brother Francis is the most memorable due to his fecklessness and wide-eyed innocence. The other two protagonists are abbots and quite formidable. A “pilgrim with girded loins” appears in all three parts. There are hints that he may be the immortal, mythical  Wandering Jew . However, there is nothing overtly supernatural in the novel so the three pilgrims can also be considered different characters. I do love the mystical aspect of the book, several events in it can be interpreted as supernatural, but hey can also be rationalized away. Walter M. Miller was a catholic and he portrays the Catholic Church as a sort of last bastion of human civilization. Certainly the Albertian Order of Leibowitz is the single monastery that ensures the survival of human knowledge, and even humanity itself.There is plenty of food for thought in A Canticle for Leibowitz, while the book is written from a Catholic viewpoint the book is not about Catholicism and Miller leaves many issues for the readers to decide for themselves. I believe the central theme of the book is Man’s tendency for self-destruction. Miller offers organized religion as a beacon of hope in dark times but he does not seem to demand that the readers accept this. Certain religious viewpoints are also called into questions and some strong secular arguments are put forward by some of the characters who are non-believers. I have no real criticism of the book, it is well paced and it never really becomes dull, but there are some passages that seem quite convoluted and a chore to get through*. Personally, I don’t think it is a “fun read” as such (though there are the occasional funny moments and ironic humour scattered around). I think it is sufficiently rewarding to be worth the effort, and on that basis, I can recommend it. ___________________________* Say What? Ineffable Quotes:“If the creature is the name, then the name is the creature. ‘Equals may be substituted for equals,’ or ‘The order of an equality is reversible,’ but may we proceed to the next axiom? If ‘Quantities equal to the same quantity may substitute for each other’ is true, then is there not some ‘same quantity’ which both name and diagram represent? Or is it a closed system?”“There was objective meaning in the world, to be sure: the nonmoral logos or design of the Creator; but such meanings were God’s and not Man’s, until they found an imperfect incarnation, a dark reflection, within the mind and speech and culture of a given human society, which might ascribe values to the meanings so that they became valid in a human sense within the culture. For Man was a culture-bearer as well as a soul-bearer, but his cultures were not immortal and they could die with a race or an age, and then human reflections of meaning and human portrayals of truth receded, and truth and meaning resided, unseen, only in the objective logos of Nature and the ineffable Logos of God. Truth could be crucified; but soon, perhaps, a resurrection.”___________________________NoteThere are quite a few Latin passages in this book.

164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Megan Baxter,985,656,4,"May 19, 2014","A Canticle for Leibowitz is Catholic science fiction, clearly written in the aftermath of Hiroshima and the shadow of the Cold War.

164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,carol.,"1,501",7546,4,"June 19, 2011","Crazy complex, a meditation on humanity and civilization. Divided into three parts, the first after what seems to have been a nuclear war, the second partway into a time of political consolidation and the rise of nation-states, but also the rebirth of scholarship, and the third at a toe-to-toe arms face-off. There are threads that connect the three very disparate sections; the canticle for Leibowitz standing in for the concept of knowledge, the monastery devoted to knowledge preservation, a wild-haired wanderer, the themes of humanity. Each section revolves partly around life at the monastery and a particular issue of their time. Being largely unfamiliar with the structure of the Catholic church, I felt a little hampered at times as some of the concepts Miller plays with seem to do with Church structure, and faith, and certainly a number of references seem to be in Latin. It didn't hamper reading, by any means, but I can't help wonder if it affected how I read Miller's larger messages, especially as the last third seems to deal with elemental questions of conceptual sin. The characters are used to illustrate the larger issues, but many are still well crafted and interesting. Brother Francis drew me into the book in the first section. There was a well rounded and interesting cast in the second, but the third seemed to be mere props for the message. A thoughtful and classic book.

164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Jennifer (formerly Eccentric Muse),440,887,5,"September 3, 2013","ETA 09/03/13: Cloud Atlas to the reading path, below.-----I was conceived somewhere late summer/early fall of 1963, roundabout the time the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed by the US, UK and Soviet Union; close to a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis and about two months before JFK's assassination. There had been an earlier miscarriage, a child who would have been a year or so older than me. I may have picked up, in the womb, an interest in the politics of that time. My father, in particular, was clearly fascinated by it: for years, he kept a stack of newspapers from the Kennedy assassination preserved haphazardly in plastic bags in a box in the basement. Also in the basement, as I discovered when sorting through some of my mother’s books after her death in 2000, was a box of books dating back to around that same time. In it, Dr. Spock’s Baby & Child Care and a book of baby names. On the inside front cover was a list pencilled in my mom's handwriting: Constance, Judith, Stella, Rebecca, Jennifer. (good choice, Mom). And in the box, a pamphlet, probably 8 or 12 pages long. The cover was a deep red with large blue and yellow type on the front: “How To Build A Backyard Bomb Shelter.” This was no joke: there were blueprints, charts and diagrams, tips on how to select a site, how to provision the shelter and so on.There was such a story being told about my parents' lives in the juxtaposition of those three books in that dusty old box in the basement, uncovered during a time of grief and remembrance. It was startling to find them there, and instantly be taken back to 1963, my own existence slightly more than a gleam in Dad's eye, but not much more than a name written in a book. To my parents, I must have felt -- the whole world must have felt -- so precarious. A crisis point during the Cold War - the air permeated by a dread and anxiety that my generation and later ones can barely comprehend. Now, the end of the world is a slow melting of ice caps and gradual warming of the planet through a series of cumulative acts of stupidity and addiction to fossil fuels. Still distant, deniable and de-personalized, like lung cancer from smoking. Then, however: annihilation would be instantaneous. The blinding flash, the mushroom cloud and its impact on real people had been seen and felt. Then, there were living human beings whose real fingers were on real buttons beside real telephones. Rockets buried in mountains were pointed at cold-warring continents. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not yet 20 years past and underground atom bomb testing was still shaking the earth, literally, on its axis. For my parents, though, it was also a time of incredible -- almost delusional ­­-- hope and optimism. That urge to procreate - that psycho-biological drive to perpetuate the species by whatever means possible - which seems to spike during times of natural or man-made disaster in spite of, or perhaps because of, the threat of utter destruction, has always baffled and fascinated me. The desire to bring new life into a world that is doomed is statistically, logically ill-advised, to say the least. It seems equal parts insane and imperative; delusional and courageous, too.That is A Canticle for Leibowitz, in a nutshell. This book, first published in 1959, holds up remarkably well (although we envision the endtimes looking a little different now than they did then). A Canticle for Leibowitz is steeped in the very real, very ubiquitous, post-WWII/early Cold War socio-political context in North America.One of the reasons for its longevity, no doubt, is its speculative fiction time-and-place setting. Taking place in three different times, centuries apart and far in the future (it wraps up circa ""The Year of our Lord 3781""), its very structure illustrates our species' cyclical stupidity and irrepressible, almost biologically-driven, hope for a different outcome, against all odds. After all human knowledge and culture is wiped out in the aftermath of a mid-20th century nuclear armageddon (and read that as a direct metaphor for the Holocaust as well as a cautionary tale for the nuclear age in which it was written -- this is a Canticle for Leibowitz, after all), an order of Franciscan monks emerge as safekeepers of what remains of all human knowledge: a shopping list, a memo to a work colleague, a blueprint for an electrical circuit (later hilariously illuminated by a bumbling monk who is central to the tri-part storyline); scraps of paper and books, painstakingly collected, protected and defended over the centuries.

164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Blaine,710,569,4,"August 29, 2022","“You don’t have a soul, Doctor. You are a soul. You have a body, temporarily.A very interesting read. I don’t normally read books with this level of religious content or imagery (or Latin, for that matter), and I’m sure I missed some of the allusions and references due to my lack of background. But I was quickly swept into this story, which largely takes place at a monastery in the southwestern US 600 (then 1,200 and finally 1,800) years after a future nuclear war.A Canticle for Leibowitz argues that there is a cyclical nature of human history: a rejection of knowledge, a rapid acceptance of knowledge resulting in great progress, and finally an abuse of that knowledge leading to war and widespread death. I did not enjoy the final third as much as the first two thirds of the book, but it certainly was a fair and fitting conclusion. Well worth reading.",49,1 comment
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Markus,469,1509,4,"March 14, 2017","This is essentially a book about knowledge.What happens to the human life that survives beyond the destruction of the world?In the ruins of what was once the United States of America, the Order of Saint Leibowitz works relentlessly to discover and preserve bits and pieces of knowledge from the time prior to the Flame Deluge. And when Brother Francis of Utah stumbles across a series of ancient writings by the holy Leibowitz himself, the discovery starts a chain of events that spans centuries of the creation and life of a new world…A Canticle for Leibowitz is divided into three parts. The first follows the desperate search for the knowledge of a lost world. The second follows the rise and expansion of new kingdoms in a world coming out of the dark ages. The third takes mankind to the brink of annihilation once more.Again, it is more than anything a book about knowledge. It follows the gathering and the use of knowledge after it has been lost. It explores the themes of truth, science, thought and religion, and in doing so becomes a postapocalyptic masterpiece.And finally, Walter J. Miller’s description of the apocalypse must be the most gorgeous account of any horrible event ever written:And the prince smote the cities of his enemies with the new fire, and for three days and nights did his great catapults and metal birds rain wrath upon them. Over each city a sun appeared and was brighter than the sun of heaven, and immediately that city withered and melted as wax under the torch, and the people thereof did stop in the streets and their skins smoked and they became as fagots thrown on the coals. And when the fury of the sun had faded, the city was in flames; and a great thunder came out of the sky, like the great battering-ram PIK-A-DON, to crush it utterly. Poisonous fumes fell over all the land, and the land was aglow by night with the afterfire and the curse of the afterfire which caused a scurf on the skin and made the hair to fall and the blood to die in the veins.",47,6
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Algernon (Darth Anyan),"1,462",926,4,"September 1, 2017","[9/10] ... for in those days, the Lord God had suffered the wise men to know the means by which the world itself might be destroyed ...He also suffered them to know how it might be saved, and, as always, let them chose for themselves... Walter M Miller published a single novel in his lifetime, so I guess he wanted to pour into it everything that was important in his life: his scientific training as an engineer, the trauma of destroying the ancient abbey of Monte Cassino from a bomber aircraft in World War Two, his conversion to Catholicism afterwards. The result is one of the enduring all time classics of Science-Fiction, a masterpiece that asks the big questions and looks at the cyclical nature of history in a story that explores humanity millenia into its possible future.Divided in three parts about six centuries apart in the timeline, the novel explores the role of the church in the preservation of knowledge in the aftermath of a nuclear war (""Fit Homo""); the conflict between religious and secular powers, between power and responsibility in a Renaissance period when the quest for knowledge is once again ascendant (""Fiat Lux"") and, finally, the destruction of an advanced civilization that has forgotten the lessons of the past and has lost the path to God (""Fiat Voluntas Tua"") . Long ago, during the last age of reason, certain proud thinkers had claimed that valid knowledge was indestructible – that ideas were deathless and truth immortal. But that was true only in the subtlest sense, the abbot thought, and not superficially true at all. [...] For Man was a culture-bearer as well as a soul-bearer, but his cultures were not immortal and they could die with a race or an age, and then human reflections of meaning and human portrayals of truth receded, and truth and meaning resided, unseen, only in the objective logos of Nature and the ineffable Logos of God. Truth could be crucified; but soon, perhaps, a resurrection. I personally loved the challenges posed by this novel that is light on conventional plot and rich in philosophical and moral debate. As an engineer, I am inclined to side with the science part of fiction, but I don't see the need to reject religion and faith out of hand as retrograde and dangerous. Miller does a sterling job, at least in the first two parts of the novel, in penning complex, nuanced character studies and in transitioning from the particular to the general concerns about the individual versus society. His arguments are balanced between an embrace of critical thinking and adherence to religious dogma, between the preservation of knowledge and the dangers of the ""will to power"". ""If you doubt it, why bother studying the Leibowitzian documents?""""Because a doubt is not a denial. Doubt is a powerful tool, and it should be applied to history."" also, When you tire of living, change itself seems evil, does it not? for then any change at all disturbs the deathlike peace of the life-weary. —«»—«»—«»—Up until the very last pages of the novel I was going to rate it a full five stars and one of my favorites, but the magic thread just snapped and pulled me out of the story at a crucial moment. The balance between science and religion, between historical extrapolation and dogma suddenly tipped over into holy miracles and a complete rejection of reason in favor of what? the Second Coming? A manifesto against euthanasia? A plea in favor of suffering as a gateway to wisdom? The immortality of the soul? Of the three abbots frontlining each main part of the story, brother Zerchi struck me as the least commendable, although, to be honest, there were signs and portents of the direction the story was taking right in the very first chapter (re:miracles).Even with my final disappointment in the overt mysticism of the ending, I still feel the novel deserves to be considered a classic and a masterpiece, a provocation and a worthy subject of debate decades after its initial publication. The world may not perish in a sea of nuclear flame as the author predicted, but right now the slower death by global warming doesn't seem so far fetched and the current world leaders appear as ignorant and self-serving today as those imagined by Miller. I may not like all his positions on faith and dogma, but I can't really argue with this one: How shall you ""know"" good and evil, until you shall have sampled a little? Taste and be as Gods. But neither infinite power nor infinite wisdom could bestow godhood upon men. For that there would have to be infinite love as well. ",46,7
164154,A Canticle for Leibowitz,Gabrielle,977,1093,4,"August 8, 2021","Catholic science-fiction about nuclear annihilation. OK, I definitely need to check this out, I thought, pulling it out of my husband’s grandmother’s enormous stash of sci-fi books. In a world where anti-science imbeciles are the reason I have barely left my apartment in 18 months (just get vaccinated, you filthy animals!), it was difficult not to cringe at times, reading a book about how a culture of anti-intellectualism effectively ruined everything. It is also fascinating to see that religion can be built around the most mundane silliness, which gets elevated to holiness because it’s not understood quite right.I read a little bit about Mr. Miller, who used his experience as a soldier in WWII, his trauma and the way he was helped and sheltered by the monks of a Catholic monastery, as strong sources of inspiration for the three connected stories that make up “A Canticle for Leibowitz”. But there is quite a bit to unpack with this book.Made of three novellas, each set about 600 years apart, this book describes a world where a nuclear war has destroyed most of our civilization and brought what's left of humanity back to an almost medieval society. But not everything has been lost: an engineer sought refuge with a religious community during the Simplification, when the uneducated masses blamed scientists for what had happened to humanity and destroyed all science and technology, and they have been keeping his documents safe for hundreds of years. Collectively known as the Memorabilia, those documents are preserved and copied by monks. Eventually, this knowledge will be brought back to light, and slowly but surely, humanity will rebuilt itself to a level closer to the one we are familiar with, but at what cost? And are the mistakes of the past bound to repeat themselves?This book is an obvious product of Cold War anxiety, but it is also an very interesting thought-experiment on the cyclical nature of history, the way empires rise to glorious peaks of prosperity and sophisticated technology only to crumble, bring everyone back down to a miserable dark age, which is then followed by a slow rebuilt. Rinse and repeat. Miller seemed to think we were on the brink of tipping ourselves straight back into darkness, and alas, a quick look at current events makes it hard to disagree with him entirely. It is also a brilliantly realized post-apocalyptic story, and using the monastery devoted to St. Leibowitz as the central location that binds the three different stories together is absolutely genius. Little elements that may or may not be supernatural, thrown in for good measure, remind us that not matter how mundane our reality is, there is always a small element of the unexplained in life that we have to reconcile with our view of reality. The writing is strong, the pacing flows very well and the society imagined by Miller rings alarmingly believable.Alas, like most Golden Age Sci-Fi, there are precious few coherent and meaningful female characters, and while I can admire the ideas, and the prose of a book like this one, this unevenness always bugs me a little. It takes over 200 pages for a female character to get a single line, and yes, I get that this isn't the point of this story, that an all-male monastery won't exactly be crawling with female characters... but it's impossible for me not to be in the least bit annoyed with this, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I can't help but feel like, while Miller had a wild and rich imagination about what might happen post-nuclear disaster, his imagination was not rich enough to imagine what role women would play in that world, which bums me out.Regardless, this is a fantastic and strong book, which is well deserving of it's classic status in the pantheon of science-fiction, and which completely deserved the Nebula it was awarded.",45,6
