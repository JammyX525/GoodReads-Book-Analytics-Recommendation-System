25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",932,17600,4,"January 16, 2023","The author has been called Woke. But there's a difference between being politically woke and having an inner Daemon.For when the Spirit of Grace descends upon the rejected outcasts of society the force of of their words can seem Daemonic, due to their widespread rejection. So it is in Louise Penny's mythical village of Three Pines, so it is with me... And so it is with Nadia.All we're doing is being OURSELVES.So how otherwise can you spread the Good News of Grace to a different sorta church - a casual, speak your mind Rainbow church?Simple.You tell it as brashly, casually and crassly as Nadia herself.Grace happens. But it doesn’t happen only to the observantly devout! For Grace forgives us ALL. And is waiting for us all.And can it can shower us all with its warmly human and Divine well-being.Though I never knew what to expect next as the movie reels of these stories unwound - what CAN you predict in stories about Grace among Bay Area Outsiders, some fairly comfortable, others down for the count?Here, Up is Down and Down is Up and ALL comfortable middle class markers of straight behaviour are outa here!She is one BRAVE pastor, this no-holds barred ringmaster in her Circus. Yet who else is going to call these good pariahs to the Feast?What a trip this book is...Yet grace always manages to peek out from under disaster, wearing as always its patient, happy-sad heavenly face of comfort.Did you know that many of the folks in YOUR life are Accidental Saints too? That happy neighbour whom we always characterize by his (really rather minor) shortcomings, for example -What about the fact that he puts you on a pedestal? Is that not a miracle - considering the insider’s view you have of your OWN faults? Or take that other, purposefully Forgotten Friend...Wasn’t that maybe partly YOUR fault? Isn’t it a miracle that ANYONE can love ANYONE else for most of your lifetime on this sinners’ planet? And what about that friend who's so crabbily LOVING and NICE with every one of Her Friends?How do you figure that one?Consider the gospel. Only sinners get into heaven - not by being perfect by comparison with sinners - but by shining out with love in the midst of their sin!And if you read my excerpts on Kindle Notes, you will readily agree that this is a book that can challenge your beliefs - just like it did mine - to the core.With understanding, we can elevate our truisms into a much more widely expansive stratosphere of insight.So prepare to be challenged!It will rock you, it will sock you -And it might just make you more compassionate towards your good friends and neighbours.",98,2

I think SHE thought I'd embrace this ""cool"" approach to Christianity. But this book was not for me. Nadia Bolz-Weber comes from an extremely conservative background. So her fresh ideas were stale to me. ""Catholics are NOT THAT WEIRD!""(I'm a Catholic.) ""I hang out with REAL GAY PEOPLE!"" I mean, that is great, and perhaps conservative people reading this will find it refreshing and innovative and maybe it will change their opinions and that is cool. But I am looking for someone to stretch Christianity much farther. Bolz-Weber keeps bragging about hanging with sinners. Jesus loved sinners! But when you're hanging out with sinners, at the same time saying ""I'M HANGING OUT WITH FILTHY ASS SINNERS!!"" doesn't it defeat the purpose? Jesus led by example and hung out with everyone, but he didn't brag about it. He just did. When Bolz-Weber spoke at the funeral of a gay man who committed suicide, she called him a sinner, reassuring people that they should not be ashamed that he was gay and killed himself. If you really want to embrace the sinners, treat them as people with as much respect as you'd treat anyone else. Maybe I'm being too critical. But if I were at that funeral and that gay, deceased man was my family member. I would be offended. I was almost sort of offended that this book was recommended to me in the first place. Has that ever happened to you? I felt the EXACT same way when someone recommended Blue Like Jazz. The person who handed it to me thought it was hip because the author doesn't speak like he was born in the 12th century and doesn't have extremely conservative religious views and speaks to me on my ""level.""I think some would call Nadia Bolz-Weber's sense of humor self-deprecating, but you can tell with each self-put down she is boosting herself up. ""I'm awful, I drink beer and have tattoos! I do evil things sometimes JUST LIKE YOU but I'm still a good person!"" But does a cool/good person have to say it so much? It's also very clear she wants to come off as badass and cool. I believe she is a good person but I don't think she's cool. Cool to me would be someone who makes me think of Christianity anew. Who really and truly lives the message of Jesus every single day without bragging about it. Because they want to, and not because they are image conscience. When that book comes around, will someone please let me know?",87,24

25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Rebecca,"3,508",2506,4,"November 3, 2015","(3.5) I knew of Nadia Bolz-Weber through Greenbelt Festival. She’s a foul-mouthed, tattooed, fairly orthodox Lutheran pastor. This brief, enjoyable memoir is about how she keeps believing despite her own past issues and the many messed-up and outwardly unlovable people who show up at her church, House for All Sinners and Saints in Denver. I especially love her new set of Beatitudes.In my favorite section, she zeroes in on one Holy Week and shows the whole range of emotions and trauma that religion can address. The Ash Wednesday chapter is the overall highlight, contrasting the funeral of a suicide with the birth of a new baby. People often think that ritual and liturgy are lifeless and empty, but Bolz-Weber shows how they can be full of meaning and foster connections between the unlikely folks encountered in the Body of Christ.Here’s a few tastes of her writing:“I’m not running after Jesus. Jesus is running my ass down.”“we’ve lost the plot if we use religion as the place where we escape from difficult realities instead of as the place where those difficult realities are given meaning.”“the really inconvenient thing about being Christian is the fact that God is revealed in other people, and other people are annoying. I understand the impulse of not wanting to be in community. I can’t argue with that. But I think the experience of bumping up against other people has changed me in ways that I never could have been changed if I was just reading books and practicing meditation. We don’t get to be Christians on our own.”",21,1 comment
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,7jane,671,251,4,"March 26, 2019","Here we have a continuation, a collection of stories from one Saint Cookies day to another five year later (when the cookies are accidentally forgotten). The author is a Lutheran pastor in Denver with her church of and for people who don't really fit in the usual churches. There is a set of discussion questions at the end and a short interview with her. We get to read of various events, both in Denver and on author's travels within US and elsewhere. You get to see her in all her goods and flaws here, which in the end mirror the goods and flaws of all people. And yet God shows mercy, grace, and humor in catching us all. You get to witness some of the traditions of her church (the cookies, the tulips, etc.), and to meet some interesting people.You end up thinking about your own versions of events featured here, your own weaknesses and fears, and get a feel of God's mercy (and sneakiness in a good way), over and over. It's quite uplifting. I think this book may be a good (or better even) companion to her previous book, ""Pastrix"", and there's many details that I can see myself pondering on even later. Very enjoyable a read.",18,2
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Scott,"1,674",119,4,"June 8, 2019","""There is something about dropping F-bombs and making fun of worship music with a bishop that makes me feel warm and fuzzy."" -- Pastor Nadia, 'minister behaving badly' on page 43After discovering Pastor Nadia Bolz-Weber via her latest release Shameless just a few weeks ago I decided to check out her previous books. (Her biographic debut Pastrix is on deck for me later this month.) I imagine that the edgy chapters in Accidental Saints are indicative of her style of sermons.Accidental Saints is a collection of nearly twenty anecdotes and observations. Pastor Nadia is very effective - like the best clergy, who are gifted in penning thought-provoking sermons that are not overbearing in preachiness - in effortlessly shifting her tone between humorous, serious, and simply inducing 'the feels.' (Maybe that's just too slang of a descriptive term for a nearly middle-aged man to use, but there were at least two instances - the consecutive chapters 'Frances' and 'Panic Attack in Jericho' - where she induced an emotional response in me with her raw but honest experiences.) I think a common refrain in her work is that she and her congregation members - and, by extension, the readers - are damaged or imperfect people, but that's okay because Christ loves us anyway. She conveys this message in a direct but reassuring manner that I did not find treacly or pandering.",17,N/A

If you've 'been around the block' a few times, or are a woman 'with a past ' you will find peace and a judgment free place to land. While her liberal use of cursing was very unusual, it did not bother me, as I can be a bit of a potty mouth myself when having a hissy fit over something unfair or cruel.I was going to give it 4.5 stars but I bumped it up to 5 when I read her last chapter on her new Beatitudes.Blessed are those are not over it yetBlessed are the losers in a world that only loves winner.Spoke to me, spoke to my past.Kudos",15,1 comment
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Reese,163,63,4,"September 7, 2016","On a 0-100 scale, what I know about Christianity comes MUCH closer to 0 than to 100. Believe me. (Note: I'm not repeating ""believe me,"" as does The Donald; so you can trust that I'm neither lying nor using ""truthful hyperbole."") Born Jewish -- and still Jewish -- I, unfortunately, don't know what I ought to know about my own religion -- much less anyone else's. And before I discuss Nadia Bolz-Weber's book, I should also confess that my desire to increase my familiarity with Christian theology has never been strong enough to measure. When I bought Accidental Saints, I did not realize that I was, in a sense, registering for ""Religion 103: Introduction to Christianity."" A few days ago, our Sabbath, I pulled it from my to-read shelf, and SURPRISE --! Page 1 offers an old Christian hymn that begins: ""Rejoice, now, all heavenly powers! Sing, choirs of angels! / Exult, all creation around G-d's throne! Jesus Christ is risen!"" Instead of singing, I'm thinkin', ""Holy, moly, why did I buy this book; should I read on and attempt to find out why?"" Obviously, I did. Yes, Bolz-Weber's Accidental Saints contains plenty of material that a practicing Jew cannot embrace -- or even understand others' acceptance of it as the TRUTH. To my amazement, however, the ""foreign"" beliefs never became an obstacle to my appreciating a work by this Lutheran pastor. The name of Bolz-Weber's church is House for All Sinners and Saints; and her book has chapters entitled -- to mention a few -- ""Absolution for Assholes,"" ""Judas Will Now Take Your Confession,"" and ""The Best Shitty Feeling in the World."" The work is a billboard promoting the value of ""letting it all hang out"" (pardon the dated expression). The unusual experiences and the commentary that Bolz-Weber shares with her readers convey important messages -- none, it seems, more important than the following: ""In the kingdom of G-d, we need not cultivate a persona to hide the lame, poor, blind, or crippled parts of us. . . . You can just be. And in just being, you can, in the fierce and loving eyes of G-d, be known, be whole, and maybe even find a little rest. Because keeping it all [i.e., 'pretend(ing) or overcompensat(ing)'] going is just exhausting"" (125-26). How many times have I said or written, ""You don't have to be Jewish"" to ""get"" a particular play, novel, movie, etc.? On a 0-100 scale -- oh, forget the scale; it doesn't go high enough. My closing comment about  Accidental Saints is, however, a first for me. You don't have to be Christian to read this book and be glad that you did. ",11,3
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Jessica,"1,152",122,5,"October 29, 2015","I freakin' love Nadia Bolz-Weber. She released the incredible Pastrix just two years ago, and she's gathered enough stories since then to have a brand-new inspiring, challenging, funny book about God and people that made me cry on at least three occasions. This book is structured over the course of a liturgical year, beginning and ending at All Saints' Day, though she draws on stories from multiple years. My takeaway from this book is that I don't need to try harder to ""be a good Christian/person"" — I need to work harder to internalize grace, mercy, and love, and then God will be able to use me in the lives of others regardless of what I myself try to do. I can practically hear her saying, ""I know, that doesn't make sense, but that's how God works."" And then she has six stories to illuminate her thoughts. She challenges those who think they can find God and live faith without being in community with other people. Her raw honesty, complete with appropriately placed curse words, is like balm on the soul of a Christian who wants to follow Jesus' example but can't figure out how to apply typical Christian platitudes to real life. I'd recommend it for basically everybody.",9,1 comment
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Sharon,338,490,3,"March 16, 2016","Not quite as raw or edgy as I'd been expecting, based on what I'd heard about this book. Given the book's subtitle, I was surprised that I didn't find the book's primary focus to be about ""finding God in all the wrong people."" Bolz-Weber tends to gloss over what is objectionable about the people whose stories she's telling -- in a way, I felt like there was a bit of defiance toward the reader in this sense, as though she were expecting us to be the ones to call the people in her examples ""wrong"" (a judgement that basically depends on where you fall on the liberal-conservative political spectrum). This stance was, for me, an alienating rather than inviting one. The opening story of her guilt after the passing of a congregant she'd never much liked was actually the one that resonated with me the most because there wasn't a political stance or assumption of audience politics attached to it. It was simply a very human, very understandable, very honest take on something that I think many people in ministry experience. From the early focus on ""wrong people,"" the second half of the book seems to shift toward simply Bolz-Weber's ways of ""finding God,"" and I appreciated the meditations on the liturgical year, House for All's practices, and theology (though more depth on the last would have been great). I particularly appreciated how Bolz-Weber shares her process around working through how to talk about current events from the pulpit. Having watched my own husband wrestle with addressing some of those same events with the right balance of righteous anger and deep compassion, I know it's such a tricky and fraught task. I was glad to see the thoughtfulness that Bolz-Weber displays in those times.Ultimately, it was difficult for me to figure out the narrative thread of this book. Undeserved grace is the resounding theme, but the method by which it arrives -- is it through people we don't like? is it through events where we can't see God? is it through liturgy? -- and is conveyed in this book was scattershot enough that though individual pieces were moving to me, when I finished the book I couldn't make the chapters cohere into one story. The word I keep returning to in order to describe my feelings about the book and Bolz-Weber's writing is ""unobjectionable""... which feels paltry and insufficient in comparison to what the book is trying to do. (Also it feels weird to judge a book that is about, at least in part, not judging things/people.)",8,1 comment
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,P,134,18,2,"February 2, 2017","I like Nadia Bolz-Weber. She’s cool and can be funny sometimes. She’s also very Lutheran, for what it’s worth; all about the sola fide. But I’m not the audience for this book, probably because it’s not so much about Finding God in All the Wrong People as it is how the Pastrix is herself the Accidental Saint. The scenes are ostensibly about other misfits coming around to the faith, but always conclude with passages about how she loves Christ but (gasp!) has tattoos, hangs out with drag queens and addicts, and says ‘fuck’ a lot. I came away from each chapter largely unaffected, because I don’t find such things scandalous within a Christian context. It’s more like a book I might recommend to my friend’s would-be progressive Methodist mom because we don’t have anything else to talk about. ",8,N/A

25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Bonnie G.,"1,219",174,5,"March 19, 2019","I am a nice Jewish girl who works at an ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) college. As a non-Christian deeply invested in the ELCA my viewpoint is perhaps a unique one. I started reading this book over a year ago. I read the first few essays, and was interested, intended to return (I often read books of essays in pieces) but somehow never did. In the meantime I picked up my life, stopped working in a Jewish nonprofit in Atlanta and moved to Fargo and began working at a tiny college that is part of a denomination for which I have come to have the greatest respect. In my position I have had the privilege to have long and complex conversations with scholars and theologians with both traditional and progressive views of the future of Christianity, Christian education, and of the ELCA. Next week our campus will be hosting Nadia Bolz-Weber, and I will have the pleasure of dining with her before her presentation, so the time was right to return to this book. I am so glad I did, and I am also glad that I did not finish the book the first time because I came at it this time with a deeper understanding of Jesus' teachings, the ELCA, where it has been, and where it might be going.I recommend this book to anyone and everyone, but I do think it is best suited to those who have some New Testament knowledge (not necessarily faith, just understanding.) I am not sure I fully understood ""grace"" before this, but I do now. And I see it is beautiful even when it is not at all pretty. I love that Bolz-Weber was dragged into faith kicking and screaming, and yet she is a person who sees the divine light within each person with stunning clarity. I do not have the compassion or self-awareness Bolz-Weber brings to life, but I too was brought to faith against my will, and I feel a sense of kinship. And speaking of clarity, this woman is a master of making difficult biblical parables clear, even when they are ugly. She doesn't pretend to know all, she doesn't run from ambiguity, she acknowledges it and wanders around in it, but she is smart and educated and she brings us along on her wanderings and from those journeys the reader is drawn to questions she might not otherwise have asked.We frequently see a very particular brand of Christianity around us now in the US, and this other brand and its liturgy, the one Bolz-Weber espouses, it sounds a whole lot like what Jesus actually had to say. At least to this nice Jewish girl who works in a Christian college.",6,N/A
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Carolyn,185,34,2,"February 3, 2016","I’m sure a lot of people will get a lot out of Nadia Bolz-Weber’s memoir Accidental Saints, but I’m not one of them. Reverand Nadia Bolz-Weber doesn’t look like your typical Lutheran Pastor. Rocking tattoo sleeves and a foul mouth, she’s a new type of preacher, the type to welcome those who have normally been turned away by the religious establishment. Her church is founded on the principle that humans are going to fuck up (so edgy with the swearing!) but that a good heart is what matters to God the most.  This book gave me flashbacks to the speakers I had to listen to in Catholic school. Every once in a while, the principle would get nervous that Christianity just wasn’t hip enough and hire some 26-year-old with a mushroom haircut and an acoustic guitar who just wanted to talk to us, man, about the best friend a sophomore could ever have…Jesus Christ. He doesn’t care about your SAT grades, man. He cares about your soul. Then he would try to sell us his CDs.Bolz-Weber’s book is about her church and the revolutionary ideals it espouses (some examples: gay people are people! Assholes are tough to deal with, but we have to be nice to them. I’m hanging out with sinners JUST LIKE JESUS HOW COOL AM I). I concede that most churches (including the one I was raised in) do a terrible job of welcoming the people Jesus would probably want them to welcome, but that doesn’t mean her church is original.I picked up the book because I was promised it was funny. A former comedian becomes a pastor? That’s weird enough to pique my interest. But in the immortal words of my man Josh “Lemon” Lyman, she “forgot the funny.”Most of her jokes are weird, not-quite self-deprecating digs at her own originality. These tattoos LOLAMIRIGHT? It sort of turns into humble-bragging. And if I want to listen to people pretend they’re not impressed with themselves, I can close my book and interact with humanity. If you like religious books, or you’re thinking about switching over to Lutheranism, then pick up Accidental Saints. The rest of you should give it a miss. This book is guilty of a mortal sin-being boring. ",5,N/A
25430352,Accidental Saints Finding God in All the Wrong People,Melora,575,139,5,"July 6, 2019","I was a little tentative about this one, thinking that the tattooed-swearing-pastor thing might be all Bolz-Weber had to offer, but I needn't have worried. Her theology is actually pretty orthodox (from an Episcopalian perspective, at least), and her stories are well told and touching. Nothing new, really, but a refreshing reminder of God's boundless love and grace and His call to us to care for even the least lovable people.",5,2
