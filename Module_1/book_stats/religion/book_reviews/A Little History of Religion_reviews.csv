28819132,A Little History of Religion,Andrew Smith,"1,016",552,4,"May 2, 2022","When it comes to religion, I’ve long been unsure whether to describe myself as an agnostic or an atheist. As a boy I attended a Christian (Methodist) church some Sundays with my parents, where a kindly gentleman would take the children aside and talk to us about… well, I can’t actually recall what he talked to us about. He obviously didn’t leave a big impression on me. Later, I attended the church youth club for a while but was eventually expelled for stealing off to a pub during a trip to a neighbouring town – the consumption of alcohol being considered a step to far for the club leader. I even dabbled with a GCE Advanced Level Theology course in my last year at school but that didn’t last long, the material was just too dry and heavy for my tastes. In fact, I always found religion to be too obscure, the debates too esoteric. I didn’t get it, and I didn’t really believe it either.This book is written in an easy to follow, matter of fact way. I found it particularly interesting as religious education classes I’d attended at school (at least, from what I can remember) focussed entirely on the Christian faith. I left school knowing virtually nothing about other world religions and what I’d subsequently picked up along the way seemed sketchy at best. I was also thankful that the text here wasn’t in any way ‘preachy’ about the subject matter; it’s very much a straight forward history of how the various religions have developed, their key beliefs and what this means for its followers.All of the major religions are covered and some minor ones too. For instance, I was fascinated to learn that that followers of the ancient Indian religion of Jainism believe in non-violence to the extent they don’t sanction the killing any of living creature and that this also extends to ‘living’ plants. Their food intake is therefore restricted to fruit that has already fallen from the tree. Followers have been known to have intentionally starved themselves to death, a practice not considered to be suicide but rather the ultimate act of spiritualism and self discipline. The text is reasonably comprehensive, if high level, with the whole spectrum of the good, the bad and the ugly aspects being touched on here: the way in which lives have been enriched but also how wars have been fought on the grounds of competing beliefs and how groups have suffered horrific persecution.So, did this book make me feel differently about religion? I can certainly see that each religion adopts a set of moral guidelines, or rules, that are pretty much essential to any intelligent society. That’s obviously a good thing and to some extent I can see that the dwindling of the Christian faith in the UK has led to what I consider to be a certain moral decline. It’s hard to pinpoint this precisely, but I nonetheless do believe this to be the case. But the bit that I can’t get past, the element that just doesn’t work for me, is the fact that each religion essentially starts with a man (an it’s just about always a man) professing to have received a message from a divine being and then claiming to speak on the entity’s behalf. No, I don’t buy this – particularly given the range of messages passed down to these so called prophets. This book lays out an interesting and colourful history in a very digestible way – but, in truth, it’s one that’s nudged me significantly closer to atheism.",107,15
28819132,A Little History of Religion,Kamil,213,1142,5,"March 24, 2017","My first 5 stars book of the year, and it's an audiobook which is quite unusual for me as I tend to wonder off when listening and due to that always am a bit hesitant with ranking. Richard Halloway introduces history of religion with such an ease and clarity that one can only applaud him for it... From it's very beginnings, as a response to the mystery of death to the most modern religious movements, from it's greatest almost art like qualities to violence it brings, there's hardly any place when he didn't make me nod my head with pleasure. Brilliant, intertwined, complex history of a construct so many people are willing to die for, strongly recommend for everybody. ",21,1 comment
28819132,A Little History of Religion,Joy Clark,411,26,3,"December 7, 2019","World religions have always fascinated me - how various cultures make sense of their world and attribute purpose to life. I fall pretty squarely in the agnostic category at this point in my life and have a difficult time with anything that can't be understood scientifically. On the other hand, I recognize that there are aspects of the world that the human mind may be unable to understand (hence the agnostic label), and I can appreciate the comfort and life direction that religion can bring. Holloway is the former Bishop of Edinburgh who left the church in 2000. He has written about his loss of faith in other books, but in this particular work he remains largely objective, providing factual accounts of the founding and practices of various world religions. He's not afraid to point out the darker side of religion, however, and acknowledges both the good and the bad aspects of major world religions. This is a history book, not an opinion piece, and you won't find much in the way of opinions or theories. A Little History of Religion is written in a language that makes it appropriate for younger and older readers, although I honestly felt a bit ""talked down to"" in the opening chapters. On the other hand, he provides entomological background for many commonly used religious words, providing a more comprehensive backdrop for understanding how various religions have started and evolved. Unsurprisingly, a large portion of the book is dedicated to the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam), which have been the most influential in Western (and Eastern, to a lesser extent) culture. I still would have liked to have seen a bit more about the Eastern religions, for my own curiosity. Overall, this is a great overview of world religions that can be enjoyed by those anywhere on the religious spectrum. Holloway does not try to push any religion but does point out its failings, which may anger some of the more fundamental practitioners. If you are fascinated by religion, as I am, this is a good place to start.",13,N/A
28819132,A Little History of Religion,Swathi,57,11,5,"September 10, 2019","Through my childhood, I've had the pleasure and discomfort of sitting through innumerable rituals at home, religiously uttering words that made no sense to me, partaking in every festivity until they became routine to me. The way my legs would cramp up after a few hours of sitting cross legged on the floor, the pangs of hunger we'd feel as we waited for the rituals to get over so we can eat, and what now I think of as the most curious ritual I've performed - placing carefully cooked and colored balls of rice on our terrace for our unfriendly neighborhood crows while praying that all the best things happen to the men in the family. We also had rituals where as a ten year old, I was expected to pray and hope for the best husband. Things rarely made sense then. I'm sure you have some stories of your own. I'm not saying that this book explains why that particular notion started, why I would be woken up at 6 to feed the cawing crows that I was terrified of, but it definitely to me lent a different way of looking at religion. A way of putting things into perspective for the bad and the good. Everything my parents said, and my grandparents spoke about is there in that one chapter of Hinduism but it made so much more sense reading it now and being able to think about the chronology (the supposed one, in some cases). The author's writing style is straight-forward, seasoned with some lines of wry humor every now and then. His utter devotion to rationality in arguments is what won me over, and his presentation of multiple sides of the delicate topic for me came through wonderfully (but to begin with, I was and am atheist, perhaps that affected my capacity to tolerate his commentary). The one thing I'd wish for was that more was said about eastern religions, although what was said already held a high potency and helped me understand religion a little better.",10,2
28819132,A Little History of Religion,Ben,155,15,4,"February 5, 2017","Any book that's billed as a ""history of religion"" and is less than 1,000 pages long is bound to generate the charge of being shallow and incomplete. Indeed this book is guilty on both counts, but I enjoyed it tremendously nevertheless and would heartily recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. Not surprisingly, this Little History is most informative on those religions that have left behind copious written records and that continue to be a force in the world today. Not surprisingly, Christianity gets quite a few pages, spread out over different sections, but Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, Shinto, Confucianism, Taoism all have their moment (or moments) in the sun, too. Unfortunately, Native North American religions barely get a mention and an alien reading this book would be forgiven for not realizing that there exist on Earth such continents as Australia and South America. Africa really only pops up as the site of Islamic conquests. The worship of the ancient Greeks & Romans also makes an appearance, the only religious tradition discussed in this book that is no longer active. The author may thus face the charge of a kind of Eurasian centrism, considering the universal implications of the title, but that may well have more to do with the availability of written sources than anything more sinister. For all that it leaves out, this book is an excellent handbook for beginning to understand the historical and intellectual currents upon which contemporary religion -- and society with it -- floats today and perhaps, too, those currents upon which it will be borne into the future.",6,2
28819132,A Little History of Religion,Anthony Zemke,60,3,4,"January 5, 2022","Richard Holloway, the former Bishop of Edinburgh, presents a simple, clear and no-frills look at the history of humanity’s religious beliefs from the perspective of a non-believer. It’s more like ‘An Ex-Christian’s Little History of Religion’. I give him +5 stars for his most pleasant and accurate Chapter on the Baha’i Faith and it’s ecumenical practice; -2 stars for skimming over Sufism, New Age Atheism, African Spirituality and Modern Spirituality; another -1 star for ending a book about religion on Secular Humanism (???); and a final +2 stars for doing such a great job at painting the history of religion as one cohesive story with many overlapping and intertwining chapters.",6,1 comment

28819132,A Little History of Religion,Swati,15,7,4,"July 10, 2021","4.5 stars!Religion is a vast and fascinating subject! And this book does a great job of introducing the subject to us objectively. It's in a chronological order for most part, covering the prominent, including the most recent, religions.However, just like the title states, this book neither provides an indepth history of all the religions (though it does cover the 3 major Abrahamic religions extensively, especially Christianity), nor claims to cover every religion in the world. So while I had an expectation of it covering more (and I really do feel it could have done more), I wasn't exactly disappointed by lack of it. I think there'll be something for everyone to pick up from this book. For me, the last couple of chapters were particularly interesting, and there were of course some religions in here which I only knew by name but had no clue about its origins.I would recommend this book as a good starting point if you have an interest in Theology.",5,2
