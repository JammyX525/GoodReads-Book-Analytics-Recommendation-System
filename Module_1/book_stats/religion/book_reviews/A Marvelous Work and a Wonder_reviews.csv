596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Eduardo,20,2,5,"October 25, 2011","This is an excellent book if you want to learn the basics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. These people out there like to talk about planets, baptisms for the dead and magic underwear. Think of them like those who would write ""Hebrew"" on some business door so the Nazis could go and kill as many Jews as they wished, or those friars who would burn protestants on the stake for wanting to read the Bible, or protestants shooting Catholics in Ireland, and Muslims wanting to kill the infidels of the Western world. They are the same and want to make us look bad so we don't get elected to government and such. Well, in this book you will see that we are Christian and then, later you can read things within context and they will not look crazy. If you say that some people are taking a wafer thinking they are eating the actual flesh and drinking the actual blood of their God you will find them weird but within context that will not sound so bad. If you hear someone saying that God told his people to kill every man, woman, child and old, and even their animals if they stood in their way to a promise land, you will not want to get even close to that religion but you see that in the Bible and the Jews believe that as much as the Christians so. Out of context it all sounds bad. So, give people a chance, don't judge Jews, Catholics, Protestants, Mormons, anyone by what bigoted people from those same religions say about others. Read this book and give the Mormons a chance to tell you what they believe.",7,N/A

There is a natural tendency that all of us engage in called ""Confirmation Bias"" it is once we have accepted a certain opinion or view we seek hard to strengthen it by finding only those things that confirm our held view. It also makes us discredit or easily write off anything that challenges our view. This book is essentially that, a now outdated attempt at nothing but confirmation bias. I no longer believe in the necessity of trying to prove faith. I think once anyone has undertaken to prove faith it is no longer faith, but a rational abstraction. A church's or a faith's power to build up lives is not based on if it is the only true church, like some winner of a philosophical competition, but its ability to change lives for the better. It shouldn't matter how true its foundation myths are, or if they are even factual. Nor should it be a competition of numbers to secure that bias, where the more people you have believing a certain view somehow confirms it. ",4,1 comment

I began over a year ago, got about half way, put the book down for a while, then picked it back up and finished. This book would probably be better to use like a reference book. LeGrand Richards is an amazing man, and this book reflects his intellect and love for missionary work. Being written in book form in 1950, there are a few things ""outdated"" in this book. But, the gospel of Jesus Christ is eternal truth, and those truths written in this book are never ""outdated"". Elder LeGrand Richards wrote much of this while serving as the President of the Southern States Mission of The church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. At the conclusion of his mission in 1937, he left this material in outline form as a guide to assist the missionaries in their study and preparation for teaching people about the gospel. Because it was intended to be used as a reference to missionaries, there is some information that was duplicated in the various chapters. I really enjoyed reading the book, and learned more about a gospel that I have been living for many years. Some of my favorite chapters include: Evidences of the Divine Authenticity of the Book of Mormon, The Gathering of Israel, Why is Man Here?, and Predestination and Foreordination. I will keep this on my bookshelf and use it as a reference anytime I am teaching a lesson or giving a talk. ",3,N/A
596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Felix,294,353,4,"December 16, 2019","This is an extensive harmonization of the Standard Works of the LDS Church. What I mean by that is that this book is a harmonization of the Holy Bible, The Book of Mormon, The Doctrines and Covenants and The Pearl of Great Price. LeGrand Richards aims to systematically present the doctrine that emerges from all four texts together, moving through various topics from chapter to chapter.This book is perhaps at its most interesting in the middle third. Much of the earlier portion deals with matters held in common with more mainstream Christian groups. The middle section tackles a number of more controversial and more radical questions. The final chapters are taken up with relatively briefly running through the various successes of the LDS movement, particularly in the State of Utah.This book used to be a part of the Missionary Reference Library (the collection of four books - besides the Standard Works - which missionaries are permitted to take with them on mission). It's been removed since, in favour of a much shorter work (Our Search for Happiness). It seems to me a strange choice, because A Marvelous Work and a Wonder is a remarkably systematic book. It deals with its topics comprehensively, and yet as briefly as is reasonably possible. Perhaps some areas could have done with updating (for example, I'm not sure how valuable various statistics about Utah in the 1940s would be to a modern missionary), but in general I think that much of it works just as well now as I imagine that it would have done when it was written.A Marvelous Work and a Wonder delves much deeper into LDS Theology than any casual (or non-LDS) reader is ordinarily going to be interested in learning about. Nevertheless, it does a great job at what it attempts to do. Harmonizing these texts is no small or easy feat. That LeGrand Richards did such a comprehensive job in only ~400 pages is very impressive.",1 like,N/A
596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Paul,29,1 follower,4,"January 19, 2009",I have and read the 1976 edition and first read the book in 1977 but have reread portions of it over the last 31 years. This is a great book for learning and sharing the basic truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. It provides very clear and concise pricipals of the Gospel. Very easy and enjoyable reading. ,1 like,N/A
596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Larry,25,2,5,"September 23, 2012","This book made a difference in my testimony of the restoration of the gospel to the earth. LeGrand Richards explained the apostasy and restoration in such a logical and understandable way that left me convinced that Church has been restored to the earth with the proper priesthood, organization and ordinances.

At the time of writing it had 1 million members and now has over 16 Million members worldwide.I joined the Church in 1962 at the age of 12 and tested it in many ways and can bear testimony of the truthfulness of it.A fascinating book.",N/A,N/A

596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Mark,195,1 follower,5,"February 5, 2019",I think every member of the Church of Jesus Christ or anyone investigating the church should read this book. It breaks down the doctrines and organizes them in a way that is very compelling. There is a reason why this is/has been approved to be read by missionaries.,N/A,N/A
596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Stephen Greco,184,2,3,"October 26, 2017",This was a decent book that basically tried to prove The Book of Mormon and the restoration of the gospel is true with natural and historical evidence. Lots of good scripture references though. I would use this book more as a resource than anything else.,N/A,N/A
596290,A Marvelous Work and a Wonder,Chelsey Ortega,277,1 follower,4,"September 27, 2016","This was pretty good. It started out with a lot of basic stuff that I already knew, but with each chapter it got deeper. I was originally challenged to read it when I was a teenager, but I never finished it. I'm glad I waited until I was an adult to read it from cover to cover, there was a lot of stuff I wouldn't have understood as a teenager. If you are knew to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I would recommend reading Our Heritage and Gospel Principles before reading this. But all three of those are a good read.
