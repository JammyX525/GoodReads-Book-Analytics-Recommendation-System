13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Crystal Starr Light,"1,335",811,5,"November 11, 2012","Biblical womanhood is a concept that any religious woman inwardly cringes at. It's this ephemeral picture of the ideal woman that seems to change depending on whom you are talking to. From my experience, it usually consists of the following:+ Proverbs 31 woman (of course)+ Submitting to your husband+ Not taking a position of leadership in the church (elders, pastor, etc.)+ BABIES! FAMILIES! WIFEHOOD!+ Don't show too much skin! Don't want the boys to slip and fall into the abyss of their lusts!+ Sex before marriage? One way ticket to hell!And more.I found Rachel Held Evans blog through Fred Clark, the Slacktivist who has been ripping the Left Behind series a new one for years. (I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit I liked those books--though I absolutely HATED the way the authors treated Chloe. And Hattie. And pretty much any female. Though it took me until recently to figure out WHY it bugged me so much.) It was through her blog that I found out about her yearlong mission to tackle the feat of embracing ""biblical womanhood"". This book is the results of her study.And I adored it. I bought the book on Thursday during lunch and immediately read 70 pages. I then read up to page 250 yesterday, reading for probably two hours solid (which I don't typically do). I finished the book at 10:30 today. My mind is still in shambles from the awesomeness of this book.There are a ton of reasons I love this book. Rachel is witty and funny and doesn't take herself too seriously. She never comes off as judgmental or holier-than-thou. She is open about the fact that she took some of these verses to their extreme (such as sitting on the roof of her house).But more so I love the conclusion: Rachel Held Evans realizes that there is no way to make a one-size-fits-most biblical woman because women don't come in one-size-fits-most. Some women love to sew; others adore sports; some have a way with words; others are blessed with money or talents that they willingly give to those in need.This is a brilliant book, a book that is desperately needed in this changing world. I plan on passing it on to my mother, who always encouraged me to embrace my gifts and not be held back by the restrictions placed on my sex (Thanks, Mom :) ). If you are willing to come into this with an open mind, if you are ready to put aside your preconceptions about what the Bible says, then you should read this book whether you are male, female, young, old, married or unmarried. Highly recommended.",84,7
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Amy,162,10,1,"April 17, 2013","Where to start with this one? I hereby resolve to finish the year 2013 without having read any more books by stunt-bloggers. Put this one on the pile with ""Julie and Julia,"" ""The Happiness Project"" parts 1 and 2, ""365 Nights,"" and the rest of this growing genre, and you'll have a pile tall enough for a nice coffee table.I'll just put this out here: I'm a Unitarian Universalist, so I don't have a theological dog in this fight. Had I been Evangelical Christian, Jewish, Quaker, or Catholic, I would have become offended at her selective interpretation of my religion's traditions for her Project purposes.I am not a reader or a fan of the author, so I was not the audience to whom she was writing and to whom she frequently refers or turns, via her blog, for advice and validation. The stunt here is that her proposal to live according to Biblical law for one year is picked up by a Christian publishing house, and we're treated to a running commentary on The Project-- which I assume her readers also got via the blog during that year.The vignettes at the end of each Theme Month highlight a specific woman mentioned in the Bible. These short pieces are very well-written and lovely; a whole book of these would have been far more readable and valuable than the constant self-referential harping on The Project. Far too much of this book was wasted in her complaints, her husband's reaction to The Project, her parents' reaction to The Project, blog readers' reactions to The Project, and complete strangers' reaction to The Project. The author's agent even turns up in these pages, which came across as truly amateur. In fact, my favorite character from the book was Maude from Hobby Lobby (shudder), whom the author failed to impress with the fact that she was a Professional Author doing a Project for a Book. Maude just did her job and sent the author on her way with supplies for a failed sewing attempt.The entire book, in fact, isn't really about living the rules for women in the Bible. The author fails to follow through on most of the arbitrary tasks she sets for herself (but her husband adorably excuses her, and they laugh it off!) This is a book about a writer who got a publisher's advance to do a stunt book, and the hilarity that ensued. She manages to trivialize by dabbling ""slap-bang"" (her term) in the sacred rituals of other denominations and faiths, and then wonders why they do not carry meaning for her beyond discomfort and/or confusion.If you're a fan of this author, you've probably already read this book because she's certainly spent enough time promoting it. If you're curious about women's roles in the Bible and in the Christian faith today, this is probably not the place to start your search. Side note: AJ Jacobs' ""Year of Living Biblically"" is the same Project, but done from a deliberately humorous point of view, and was a truly fun read from which I actually learned something. As for me: no more blog-to-book reading this year. I promise.",74,9
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Julie G ,857,2630,4,"August 9, 2017","Rachel Held Evans describes herself in this book as “curious, skeptical, and strong-willed.” Well, what a coincidence. . . those are almost exactly the same words I'd use to describe myself (I might replace “skeptical” with “sassy.”)So, we have that in common, but what is different is our backgrounds. While she was being raised in a Southern, evangelical Christian environment, I was being raised in a multi-cultural community in a non-religious household. I had a father who favored lively debates, humor and critical thinking while Evans was part of a larger church community that favored a traditional womanhood, citing biblical support for these roles.I was given the freedom to discover God my own way, and that involved meditation and prayer, learning scripture as a way of better understanding John Milton and William Blake, and reveling in the words of people like Elie Wiesel, Anne Lamott, the Dalai Lama and Rumi.Evans didn't have this freedom, but she still had that “curious, skeptical and strong-willed” mind, and, as she got older, she asked more and more questions and was given fewer and fewer answers. She wondered “why the Bible includes such harsh laws about women” and she found herself wishing that Christian apologists “wouldn't be in such a hurry to explain these troubling texts away, that they would allow themselves to be bothered by them now and then.”She also throws out, “I have come to regard with some suspicion those who claim that the Bible never troubles them. I can only assume this means they haven't actually read it.”So, she sets out to dedicate herself to the scripture from the Bible that pertains to the roles of women. She takes on a year of biblical womanhood, exploring such notions as obedience, modesty, purity and grace, as set forth by the Old and New Testaments of the Bible.The results are often hilarious, as Evans's writing style is personable and funny, and the results are occasionally surprising and frequently thought-provoking and poignant.I laughed out loud in many parts and shed several tears, too, especially after reading about a ceremony she and a friend performed, to help release the pain of the women from these biblical writings who had been raped or murdered, through the centuries, all in the name of “purity.”Women haven't had an easy time of things, and this is an excellent and often fascinating exploration of the grand and intimidating topic that is womanhood.I imagine that I am not the typical person who would pick up this book, but I've already mentioned that I'm a curious person, and maybe that's a good thing, as Ms. Evans has found herself a new reader.I am not clear on who would enjoy this and who wouldn't, but I found myself reading passages aloud to family and friends, and thinking about it when I wasn't reading it. This was a brave undertaking, and this is no puny book.",40,30
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,K,900,6,4,"January 2, 2013","I can see why this offends conservative Christian sensibilities. But it is hardly extreme. She sets out to point out that conservative Christians cherry pick verses and interpretations as much as they accuse those of us who have more moderate viewpoints. And she succeeds admirably, all the while, also learning to understand various standards of womanhood with less judgment.Her chapter on parenting was the most refreshing for me. Most women without children don't have any reason to notice, let alone, engage in the ""mommy wars."" So it was refreshing to hear her struggles within the ""war"" without having the emotional baggage of children to skew her. It reminded me that these ""wars"" are made up and don't determine our fitness as a mother or a woman. This chapter alone made the book worth reading. As a moderate in so much of my life, including parenthood, I am often abused by women on all sides who take my lack of enthusiasm toward their ""cause"" as a sign of disapproval and therefore I am worthy of harsh judgment. The other chapter that touched me was on social justice. Being a libertarian, social justice is something important to me. Creating fair playing grounds for people to grow and achieve is close to my heart. But so are free markets, and this chapter made me squirm a bit with the abuse by big corporations towards the poor. There is no excuse for slavery, but yet our consumerist lifestyle breeds the need for more for less. We, the consumer, are the problem. And that is a hard pill to swallow but one that needs to be. I have been purchasing fair trade coffee for about two years now but I can't ignore that I am part of the problem. She also gives a good road map for starting. You don't need to switch your lifestyle all at once, but rather pick a few things at a time.The chapter on submission was thoughtful but using Debi Pearl's book, ""Created to Be His Helpmeet,"" is a little unfair. This book is wildly out there even for many conservatives. Ultimately, she concludes that most people looking for a Biblical standard of womanhood are trying to shortcut faith by creating rules as a substitute. Her use of scripture and various commentaries to support her arguments gives her message strength, which seems to be why so many Christian reviews have to attack her for how she argues and not her argument in and of itself. I found the book both humorous and endearing.",18,N/A
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Gail,326,83,3,"April 16, 2013","In response to the “contemporary biblical womanhood movement” - largely organized around the proposition that “the only sphere in which a woman can truly bring glory to God is the home” - feminist and Evangelical Christian Rachel Held Evans set aside a year to explore and write about “biblical womanhood.” I wish she’d taken more time and done it right.Rather than adopting the practices of any one group of women claiming to live biblically, Held Evans pulled bits and pieces of several faiths - including Orthodox Judaism - to create a series of fairly arbitrary projects and rules for herself. Though I found the random, self-conscious, and haphazard (she admits many of her efforts have a slapdash feel) nature of the experiment irksome, I must admit that this approach dovetails nicely with her ultimate conclusion: “For those who count the Bible as sacred, interpretation is not a matter of whether to pick and choose, but how to pick and choose. We are all selective. . . . When we turn the Bible into an adjective and stick it in front of another loaded word [like womanhood] . . . we tend to ignore or downplay the parts of the Bible that don’t fit our tastes. . . . So after twelve months of ‘biblical womanhood,’ I’d arrived at the rather unconventional conclusion that[] there is no such thing. The Bible does not present us with a single model for womanhood and the notion that it contains a sort of one-size-fits-all formula for how to be a woman of faith is a myth.”Structured around a month spent examining a particular value (like, “purity”), each chapter contains fascinating biblical anecdotes, far less interesting descriptions of the author’s process, and saccharine lessons learned (e.g., “[P]urity is found not in the body, but in the heart” and “In silence, it seemed, I had finally found my voice”). Sprinkled sparingly throughout the book are glimpses of the wit which must be what makes Held Evans such a popular blogger (my favorite: “Going into this project, I was determined to avoid the whole crumple-to-the-kitchen-floor-in-a-heap-of-sobs bit, as it’s getting a tad cliche, don’t you think? So I feel it’s important to note that I didn’t crumple to the kitchen floor in a heap of sobs; I just happened to be sitting on the kitchen floor when I started to cry.”). Perhaps if she hadn’t written the book while living it, her reflections would have been marked by greater ease and humor.Held Evans does, however, accomplish one truly impressive feat. Thanks to her religious background and seemingly exhaustive research, she speaks the language of “the modern biblical womanhood movement” and in so doing manages to be quite critical of certain lifestyle choices without assuming an outsider’s uninformed, skeptical, condescending, and judgmental air: “Women should not have to pry equality from the grip of Christian men. It should be surrendered willingly, with the humanity and love of Jesus, or else we miss the once radical teaching that slaves and masters, parents and children, husbands and wives, rich and poor, healthy and sick, should ‘submit to one another’ (Ephesians 5:21).”Overall, the book is interesting but not riveting. Amusing but not funny. Thought-provoking but not profound. I admire and appreciate Held Evans’s effort, but I can’t beat back the feeling that both the experiment and book could have been much more.",16,2
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Kristina,34,6,4,"November 30, 2012","I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. Let me say off the bat that her hermeneutical methods are shaky (how we apply the Old Testament after Christ and through the lens of Peter's vision regarding clean/unclean, etc.) so I am going to choose to stick with my complementarian worldview. For a good explanation of why I have trouble with her background assumptions, see Kathy Keller's review of the book (see blogosphere for that one.) However, the book itself is an amusing read, most of the way through. In a few places it bogs down; in a few places the tone is a bit too cutesy for me. But in general, it's interesting in the same way that Kevin Roose's ""The Unlikely Disciple"" is interesting -- it gives a view of aspects of evangelical culture in a mostly well-written and humorous tone, from someone who no longer (or, as in the case of Roose, never) fits into the subculture as he/she might formerly have. So for accuracy of doctrine, etc., I'd give it probably a two; but for compulsive readability I'd probably give it a 4.5. Evans does endeavor in most places not to personally attack those she disagrees with and even aims for a sympathetic tone toward complementarians, though she often doesn't manage not to be belittling. I appreciated that aspect of her writing.",15,N/A
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Sharon,136,13,1,"March 19, 2017","Christian women's ethics are a hot topic no matter what your background is. And this book was written by a Christian claiming to be a fresh thinker bringing some much-needed Endust and a rag to some dusty topics. But truth be told, give me Gloria Steinem any day over Rachel Held-Evans. I'm no feminist. But frankly, neither is RHE. Rachel Held-Evans' ""godly"" woman is as lame as they come. She ignores the entire catalog of crazy God-fearing women and only defines herself by some random verses from the purity laws and Proverbs 31. And concludes the matter by saying that all of those things were probably irrelevant and leaves it at that. Her femininity remains untouched by Christ or His Church, and in the process, becomes distinctly neuter.Her experiment is based on the notion that femininity in the Bible is contained in laws and specifications, not in the heroines who grace our story. And her approach to the Bible is wooden: the Proverbs 31 lady ""clothes herself in purple"" so I'm going to JoAnn's and sew me some purple clothes - and I'm not going to bother to think about the fact that that is a reference to royalty and wealth. She's not even attempting scholarship here.Don't waste your time with this book. If you want to engage with real feminism, read Our Bodies, Ourselves. If you want to engage with real femininity, read Ruth, or Esther, or Elizabeth Elliot.",15,N/A
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Caitlin,278,62,4,"October 29, 2012","There are a lot of people who will love this book.There are a lot of people who will hate this book.And there are a lot of people who will never know which crowd they belong in because they are afraid to pick up this book. The premise is simple: Rachel goes on a year-long quest to find out what true ""Biblical Womanhood"" really is. You know, to separate the fact from the fiction, and the rumors from the what the Bible really says. During her year, Rachel took the Bible completely literally. She got weighed down in the details, trying to live according to the Torah and the commandments and descriptions found within it. She wore head coverings, she tried to become like the Proverbs 31 woman, and she even tackled the ""modesty"" debate.Being a woman isn't for the faint of heart. That's one thing that I really loved about this book. As Rachel discovered, one of the highest compliments in the Bible was being called a ""Woman of valor"" by your husband. Which is at the heart of Proverbs 31. She began to celebrate valor in the lives of the woman around her and her eyes were opened to what ""Biblical Womanhood"" looked like around her. It takes valor to raise a family. It takes valor to stand up against injustice. It takes valor to speak up and question when the status quo simply does not make sense. Women around the world are living in valor and are unrecognized. There were times when I wanted to chuck the book across the room. Not because I was furious with Rachel. She isn't writing the book as an expert but rather offering a glimpse into her own experience. Don't take her words as gospel-truth because they aren't and she'd probably never want you to give her words that amount of weight. I was furious when I read passages taken from other texts that I personally disagreed with - which will probably lead to me studying up on them later for myself to see what they really say. One of the passages that resounded the most with me was when Rachel said this:When we turn the Bible into an adjective and stick it in front of another loaded word (like manhood, womanhood, politics, economics, marriage, and even equality), we tend to ignore or downplay the parts of the Bible that don't fit our tastes. In an attempt to simplify, we try to force the Bible's cacophony of voices into a singles ton, to turn a complicated and at times troubling holy text into a list of bullet points we can put in a manifesto or creed. More often than not, we end up more committed to what we want the Bible to say than what it actually says.It makes me ready to dig into my Bible and find out for myself. Which is one of the best things a book can do for me. ",14,8
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Jenn LeBow,42,10,4,"November 2, 2012","Yes, it's a controversial book. People seem to have lined up to love it or hate it based simply on their opinions of Rachel. Here's the bottom line: if you can't read one person's story of approaching Scriptures literally, but with a sense of humor intact, avoid this book. Rachel, like many 20- or 30-something people in the U.S., mixes humor in with deeper or more thoughtful insights. That she does this in relation to the Bible and her view of Christianity seems to be objectionable to her critics.Since I have, more than once, laughed in church when my cheesy language alert went off, that doesn't bother me. I did wonder how she would approach Old Testament passages in light of her faith in Christ, but she won me over with her serious friendships formed over the course of the year with people such as an Orthodox Jewish woman and with her willingness to undergo change, even if it didn't fit with her original game plan.I don't agree with everything Rachel writes, but I appreciate her honesty, humor, and her love for the Bible. Those three characteristics shone through the controversy and made this a truly enojyable reading experience. ",14,N/A
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Amanda Mae,337,20,5,"April 28, 2017","When I saw this book in a catalog at work, I was more tickled at the idea. I've discovered over the last few years that I am fascinated by religion and religious culture - not just of my own faith, but of many others. I love learning how others interpret scripture, and how traditions are made and kept. I ordered this book for my library, and checked it out as soon as I saw it on the New Releases shelf. I found that the author is a liberal-leaning evangelical Christian, and was then REALLY intrigued to read it! Very quickly it is evident that this book and project were inspired by A.J. Jacobs' ""Year of Living Biblically"" -- another book I was fascinated by. This one, naturally, is the woman's perspective, and while there are overlaps in some ways, I gained a lot from this book simply because I am a woman, and it is a story for ME. It also reminded me a lot of Jana Reiss' ""Flunking Sainthood,"" with a nod to Julie Powell's ""Julie and Julia."" And while the whole ""do something in a year"" idea can be a little hokey (and I think even the author of this book thought that at times), it still is an interesting approach to learning and growing and gaining. I thoroughly enjoyed ""A Year of Biblical Womanhood."" Many of the questions and doubts Evans had as she approached the project I have, too, and it was comforting to see that it's not just Mormon Feminists who have some of these thoughts and crises. Each month, Evans had a different virtue to focus on and approach, like Charity, Modesty, or Silence, as well as her own ""ten commandments"" that she kept throughout the year for consistency, like covering her head whenever she prayed, or submitting to her husband. (BOY did that one take some interesting turns!) And I have to say, her husband is one sweet, encouraging, long-suffering man who helped make this book what it is. (Which reminded me of when my dad went to see the film Julie & Julia, and I made a crack about him seeing a chick-flick. He responded in a way that reminds me why my dad is amazing and why I love him so much, ""I didn't see it so much as a chick-flick, but as a movie about husbands supporting their wives."" *cue eyes welling up with tears*)This book gained brownie points with me early on in the chapter on Domesticity, when Evans brings up the story of Mary & Martha, which tends to not get used in the best ways. She recalls carrying around her Precious Moments Bible as a kid, with a picture of the Mary & Martha scene - Mary looking pious as the Virgin Mother at the feet of Christ, and Martha looking like a harried ugly stepsister. Evans' approach to the story I found much more satisfying, and will probably be something I will refer to in future talks and lessons I give in church for awhile to come. Something clicked in me when I read it, and I really want other people to think about her interpretation.She strikes up a lively correspondence with the wife of a rabbi, a delightful lady who offers wonderful insights to Hebrew words and phrases, and to Jewish tradition. Those gems alone are worth reading the book. Evans makes a trip to Bolivia that brough tears to my eyes, and reminds me that whatever problems I may think I have, are miniscule compared to the plight of some of the women she met. She describes stories of women from the Bible, comparing interpretations and showing that so many of these women get condemned or forgotten for no real reason other than merely being women. She demonstrates the importance of them all, and how pivotal they were to history and gospel, and how faith-building their stories are. I think this a great book for women of religious convictions who still have questions regarding their roles in their faith. It's comforting to see a woman like that undergo a project like this that is so faith-affirming, in addition to being funny and entertaining. Eshet chayil! Woman of valor!",8,N/A
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,TinaB,528,135,2,"January 11, 2019","2.5/3 StarsI somewhat liked this book, even though I don't agree with all of Evans thoughts or many of her views on theology, but I did love her humor, her very relate to you struggles with the Bible and some of the thought provoking ways she made me see culture and how rigid religion can place women in boxes. While I didn't love how she treated branches of the religion, I did like her book personality.For the most part I found her views interesting and even at times refreshing when it came to being a modern day woman living in a world where Christianity is very unpopular. By this sentiment I mean Evans seems honest, and in touch with how women are viewed in the Christian culture and the roles we are forced or limited to play. Evans seems to speak whatever she feels about whatever topic she wants and isn't afraid to piss off fundamentalists (a dying breed of religious folks) or should I say conservatives who disagree with her. What stumped me though was how a progressive Christian woman who devalues conservative Christian women and makes most of what she researches in Biblical living humorous, can be taken seriously.Speaking up against years of Christian tradition and laying a new outlook for modern people takes courage,(or an over-bloated ego) the backlash can be overwhelming, you're going to have all those hater conservatives riled up against you but at the same time boost your book sales and blog page views. Is Rachel Held Evans a person I would go to for advice on the Bible? No. Is she someone who understands culture and women? Most definitely. Would I recommend this book to everyone? Probably not.The truth: I love the way Evans presents herself, she is a 'funny' lady, and yeah her stuff is overboard with the PC, and yeah she misquotes a few Calvinist preachers in her book and blog posts to garner reactions, and yeah she devalues scripture and even in some spots mocks it, but at least I can hand it to her that she still manages to come across in a way that is authentic.

13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Stacy,169,399,3,"August 7, 2020","Interesting read! I didn’t agree with all of Evans’ conclusions, but she made me think many times.

13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,J. L. Neyhart,410,145,5,"June 11, 2019","I just finished re-reading this book, and this part nearly took my breath away. At the end of the book, Rachel listed several resolutions, things she wanted to do as she went forward after this project. This was number 7:""Champion women leaders in the Church. Whatever small influence I may have over the Christian community, I will use to advocate on behalf of my talented sisters who long to use their gifts to benefit the Church and the world. I will share my platform with women writers. I will lend my support to women leaders. I will cheer on women scholars and teachers. And I will speak out against those who try to silence them with patriarchal readings of Scripture that idolize the culture and context in which the Bible was written over the equality and freedom granted to each of us in Christ.""She said she would do those things, and she did. Woman of integrity. Woman of valor.Rachel also said she would ""Keep loving, studying, and struggling with the Bible—because no matter how hard I fight it, it will always call me back."" and ""I’d learned to love the Bible again—for what it is, not what I want it to be."" As always, I see myself in her words. I see my own journey and struggle and commitment to keep wrestling with the Bible. As Rachel said, ""The Bible isn’t an answer book. It isn’t a self-help manual. It isn’t a flat, perspicuous list of rules and regulations that we can interpret objectively and apply unilaterally to our lives. The Bible is a sacred collection of letters and laws, poetry and proverbs, philosophy and prophecies, written and assembled over thousands of years in cultures and contexts very different from our own, that tells the complex, ever-unfolding story of God’s interaction with humanity. When we turn the Bible into an adjective and stick it in front of another loaded word (like manhood, womanhood, politics, economics, marriage, and even equality), we tend to ignore or downplay the parts of the Bible that don’t fit our tastes. In an attempt to simplify, we try to force the Bible’s cacophony of voices into a single tone, to turn a complicated and at times troubling holy text into a list of bullet points we can put in a manifesto or creed. More often than not, we end up more committed to what we want the Bible to say than what it actually says.""I also love these quotes at the end of the book:""For those who count the Bible as sacred, interpretation is not a matter of whether to pick and choose, but how to pick and choose. We are all selective. We all wrestle with how to interpret and apply the Bible to our lives. We all go to the text looking for something, and we all have a tendency to find it. So the question we have to ask ourselves is this: Are we reading with the prejudice of love or are we reading with the prejudices of judgement and power, self-interest, and greed?If you are looking for Bible verses with which to support slavery, you will find them. If you are looking for verses with which to abolish slavery, you will find them. If you are looking for verses with which to oppress women, you will find them. If you are looking for verses with which to liberate and honor women, you will find them. If you are looking for reasons to wage war, you will find them. If you are looking reasons to promote peace, you will find them. If you are looking for an outdated and irrelevant ancient text, you will find it. If you are looking for truth, believe me, you will find it."" **********My original review from 2012:
  A Breath of Fresh Air - Entertaining and Thoughtful
There has been a lot of controversy from the ""conservative evangelicals"" about this book, but I loved it! It made me laugh and it also made me think. In many ways it was like a breath of fresh air for me as she dives into so many of the same questions I've been asking.I love the conversational style of the book and the ways Evans is able to laugh at herself and tackle deep hermeneutical questions about how we interpret the Bible, specifically as it applies to women's roles in the church, in the home, and in life in general.As others have noted, there may not be new arguments here, but Rachel made the work of scholars much more accessible and personal. (And again, renewed my desire to dig deeper.)Reading this book reawakened my love of the Bible in ways I could not have anticipated.",7,N/A
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Lori,131,4,3,"March 6, 2016","The amount of controversy kicked up by Rachel Held Evans never fails to amaze me. She says stuff I disagree with, stuff I agree with, and a lot of points in between that are just .... ideas. Not brilliant or heretical or life-altering. Occasionally perceptive, deep, and moving.So it was with this book. After noticing how the mere mention of RHE turns many of my (otherwise nice, kind, normal) male Christian friends into raging assholes who feel the need to stomp all over my Facebook feed, I started reading more of her works to see what the fuss was about.A Year of Biblical Womanhood punches all the buttons of someone who wants to hate RHE's books: She's happy to pick and choose theological and religious experiences; she rejects some standard, beloved Evangelical positions; she argues for women in spiritual leadership; the whole book just seems like it should be a Big Deal when it really isn't. On the other hand, she unpacked Proverbs 31 in a way that makes the passage a blessing for women rather than a burden; she asks good questions; she grew up a lot during her yearlong experience and it was fun to watch her make the journey. I remember being 30 and uncertain and searching. This is a 3-star book IMO for it's valuable despite being lightweight. There's little theological depth here; but many women will resonate with Rachel's honesty, courage, and questions. (If you're looking for a better read from RHE, I recommend Faith Unraveled.)I'm not sure why people rage so much at someone else's personal narrative. I encourage you to give her a read and be honest enough to acknowledge the portions where she forces you to think. That is always a gift, and we should be thankful to those authors who give us that opportunity.",7,1 comment
13544022,A Year of Biblical Womanhood,Kristin,108,2,2,"April 1, 2013","I wanted to like this book. All of my friends love this book. It had the potential to discuss everything I hold dear - Christianity, motherhood, feminism and femininity. My favorite part about this book were the vignettes at the end of the chapters on Biblical women (particularly Junia, who I'd never heard of). But, in so many other ways the book fell short. It bothered me how much of the book seemed to be ""crowd-sourced"" beginning with how she makes church ladies do her crafty projects and continuing with how large segments of her chapters were quotes from readers of her blog, the most ubiquitous of which was an Orthodox Jewish woman named Ahava. (To be honest, I would have been much more interested in a book of the same title written by Ahava.)The book also lacked a firm stance on anything. Every chapter seemed to end with some sort of non-committal statement like, ""some women are meant to stay home and some are meant to work, both are biblical."" While I agree with this statement, I don't think reading her chapter shallowly exploring the world of women's work would have brought me to the same conclusion.Finally, what struck me most about this book was how little Held Evans had experienced of the world before writing it. She's older than me, and yet I felt like I was reading a book written by a 22-year-old. She acts like traveling to South America, visiting with the Amish, baking your own loaf of bread, buying fair trade foods, dressing modestly and spending time in silence at a Catholic monastery are novel ideas. I'm 28 and I either have done or do all of these things (the Amish part only because I married a Mennonite). She glosses over the issues of motherhood (to me, one of the core differences between men and women) with a day of babysitting and a few days with a ""computer baby"". She has not experienced the anguish of 6 months of sleepless nights with a colicky newborn, questioning whether God ever really called you to do anything else. She has not had to face whether returning to a life of public ministry or a God-called vocation will cause your children to suffer. All of this isn't to say that I don't enjoy Held Evans. I do. I will look forward to the first book she writes after having children. I'm eager to hear her new perspective, as I think it will be deep and insightful. I appreciate her sense of humor, and I feel like she is someone who I would be friends with if we lived in the same town. I simply didn't find any deep spiritual insight into myself as a woman through reading this book.",6,N/A
