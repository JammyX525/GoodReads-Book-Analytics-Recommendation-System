26244,A Confession,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",932,17600,5,"January 19, 2023","When Tolstoy had a Massive Enlightenment experience in mid age, his illusions were irreparably shattered.He saw clearly now that he had goofed up - big time - with War and Peace and Anna Karenina, the very blockbusters that had made him a worldwide household name.Like Sartre, the irruption of the Absurd had set his world - and his Very Fame - on its head. And Tolstoy knew he had had it all wrong.For his vision of a happy family was based on a petit bourgeois sham, as Sartre saw. Instead of all happy families now being the same, as in ‘Anna’, all ‘happy’ families were now just ‘keeping up with appearances’ and making do.And yet pop Christianity puts the ‘nuclear family’ on a pedestal...No, Tolstoy thought - unhappy couples trying to make their marriages WORK are the Happy Ones! The Lord does the rest.So, you see, unlike Sartre, Tolstoy had found HOPE. It’s basic Taoism. Work alongside things taking their natural course - with a Faith that they’ll work out!But Tolstoy was a towering Genius, and thus had a Daemon within him that wanted to subvert ‘normal’ faith. So he opposed the national church. He supported splinter groups like Canada’s immigrant Dukhubors. He wreaked merry mayhem in Czarist Russia, and even this whole polite planet was too small for his raging iconoclasm!Now, let me ask you: if you rifle through the online discussions here on GR any night of the week, whadaya see? I’ll tell you. You see traditionalists opposing modernists. You see Hegelian dialectics disturbingly at work, breaking structures down - and building New Ones up.You see people speaking their minds.You see Tolstoyan conflicts playing out and resolving themselves.In short, you see PERSONAL GROWTH.Get it? Tolstoy NEVER stopped growing!And neither should WE, folks.Want a gripping coming-of-Age autobiography about a great man finally facing off - and Coming Clean - with HIMSELF?And REFUSING to compromise, failing and being laughed at - but Always getting up again?Read THIS. It’s beautiful.And it’s so US.",237,22
26244,A Confession,Mark André ,110,225,4,"February 1, 2019","An interesting little book. Unhappy with just being brilliant, famous and wealthy the author narrates the story of his personal quest to find the truth about existence: the point to being alive, and the correct way to happiness. First he challenges science and philosophy for answers. Then he contemplates suicide. Then he turns to the simplicity of the animals as he calls them, the peasants in the fields, and turns back to God and the church of his childhood. But once there he must challenge the authenticity of organized religions' manifest intolerances for each other, and decides he must now study all the scriptures, and promises another book which I have not seen. A very honest effort.",96,98
26244,A Confession,Piyangie,504,360,4,"January 13, 2021","I'm not quite sure how to review this nakedly honest disclosure of the mid-life spiritual crisis of one of the greatest literary giants. This short work really left me stunned, and it took some time to quiet my mind enough to pen my thoughts. In the first part of the story, Tolstoy explains his frustration (which ultimately shapes into depression) over not understanding the meaning of life. He resorts to science, philosophy, metaphysics, and religious practices to learn the true meaning of life. But, at every quarter, he is disappointed. Having not found a clear answer to his question and seeing the suffering and death as inevitable, and thinking there is nothing but darkness ahead, he contemplates suicide. But, although he contemplates suicide, he never attempts at it and calls it cowardly (I disagree with him there). In very plain words, he describes how he avoided every opportunity and every temptation by distancing himself from everything with which he could harm himself. The second part of the story describes the methods to which he ultimately resorts to find a comprehensible answer to his question on the meaning of life. In this part, Tolstoy describes how the Christian teachings (separate from Christian traditional practices of the Orthodox Church) helped him to answer the question. This genuine and honest account was really heart-wrenching. I just couldn't believe that I was reading the tortured mind of one of the most successful and revered authors of all time. This was the literary giant who wrote two great masterpieces that continue to awe its readers. And honestly, I had a hard time accepting that the same genius mind was tortured to this extent after writing those great masterpieces. At the same time, I felt a closeness to him. Some years ago, I had a personal crisis in my life that forced me to seek the ""truth"" in life. I'm of a different faith, but that is immaterial, for the quest was similar, although the circumstances lead to it differed. Tolstoy stops his account at his chosen path, but it is not a secret that he did find comfort and a purpose to live for through his religious convictions. And so did I. Reading this true account brought some bittersweet memories, and oddly it brought me comfort too.",58,9
