21348,Aesops Fables,Sean Barrs ,"1,099",44100,3,"April 22, 2017","Aesop wrote many intelligent fables in here, and some are real life lessons. One of the most famous, and also the one I take the most from, is The Hare and the Tortoise. We all know the story and the maxim: slow and steady wins the race. Being arrogant and fast isn’t all that. I remember reading this at school for the first time when I was around five to six years old, and somehow, it stuck with me. I always take the tortoise approach in life whether it be writing essays or training for marathons. I take things at my own pace, and do things in my own time. It's the best way.   In terms of general readability though, I did find some of these very repetitive. It’s not the sort of thing you read a lot of at once, as it all blurs into one. It’s best to take your time and read a few a day or perhaps just pick out a handful that you think will appeal to you. For every decent one I read, I read two that were a bit pointless. It’s very hit and miss.",59,3

  AESOP'S ECHOES
It is amazing how so many popular references and common senses are found here. Aesop finds his echoes throughout the high flying philosophers and through the earthy grandmothers, not only engrafted into the literature of the civilized world, but familiar as household words in daily conversation of peoples, across borders. It is all pervading. And to top it off, such great pleasure too.Wisdom, and simplicity, and entertainment - through unforgettable stories - what more could be asked?Aesop: The OriginsThe most famous of Greek poets, Aesop was born about the year 620 B.C., by birth a slave. He was owned by two masters in succession, and won his freedom from the latter, as a reward for his learning and wit.As a freedman in the ancient republics of Greece, Aesop now had the privilege and the permission to take an active interest in public affairs; and Aesop, raised himself to a position of high renown - a political ambassador of sorts. In his desire alike to instruct and to be instructed, he travelled through many countries. And in his discharge of his commissions, is said to have, by the narration of some of his wise fables, reconciled the inhabitants of those cities to the administration of their times.Here we can detect and understand some of the common themes that run through these fables - those of keeping to one’s appointed place/station, the utility of inherent strengths which might not be easily visible and of the perils of overreaching.These, and other, but still few, simple strands of wisdom is reinforced again and again in different situations - which is the essence of the craft of a fabulist.
  Aesop: The Fabulous Fabulist
The Fable, like any Tale, will contain a short but real narrative; it will seek, like any Parable, to convey a hidden meaning, but by the skillful introduction of fictitious characters; and it will always keep in view, as its high prerogative, and inseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or political truth.And yet, even when trying to realize profound human truths through itself, it so conceals its design under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the wood, or the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser.Thus the superiority of the counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable, is kept out of view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader is led, unconsciously to himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his indignation excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy. This format also required the fabulist to keep a unity of character throughout - The introduction of the animals as characters should be marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal popular consent. The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the Lion bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the Ass patient, even as they are made to depict the motives and passions of men.Aesop’s fables achieve this unity and consistency so throughly that now they have passed into popular consciousness. Indeed, we can even assert that these animals, as we know them today, were created in these Fables!
  Aesop: The Companion
Aesop's Fables are valuable companions. These stories pack much distilled wisdom in them and can be employed with great effect. It is said that a few good stories are better moral equipment than the best tracts of philosophers.Even Socrates is mentioned by Plato as having employed his time while in prison, awaiting the return of the sacred ship from Delphos which was to be the signal of his death, in turning some of these fables into verse from what he had committed to memory over his long lifetime. Socrates, like Aesop, understood that we are all moralists, seeking the human judgements that inform ours, and other’s actions. But morality forced down by edict can be very forbidding. This forbidding notion of morality was what inspired the philosopher Bertrand Russell to remark that the Ten Commandments ought to come with the sort of rubric which is sometimes to be found on examination papers of ten questions: ‘Only six need be attempted’. It is noteworthy that Socrates tried to emulate in his own teaching method the technique of the great fabulist - of letting the listener arrive at his own conclusions, or at any rate, avoiding the biggest pitfall any teacher can fall into - of being perceived as a moral superior.In how Socrates shaped up as a teacher, we can very well see why the most earthy and yet the loftiest of philosophers considered Aesop’s fables to be masterpieces, a constant source of companionship and teaching - and also a manual on teaching well.We would be well served to do the same.",48,23
21348,Aesops Fables,Fabian,933,1525,3,"January 8, 2022","I must admit that at this time some of these tales fell flat & are as antiquarian as... Carriages? Shepherds?But still, some of them are cynical enough to strike my fancy, and most of them end with a little innocent critter dying and learning a mistake way too late--all so that we can benefit. There is misogyny, racism, classism... the works. Its deletion of this from the ""1001 Books"" List doesn't affect me (or you), really.My favorites include the one about the bat who denies his classification of ""rat"" when captured by a hound and of ""bird"" when caught by a cat-- escaping twice with his life (Hey--I must admit that travelling in Europe as a Mexican has many more perks (like others' attitude and treatment of you) than travelling as an American. Like Also, the stupid girl who dreams while a pail of water atop her head tumbles, ruining those aforementioned fantasies (silly, stupid girl!) is likewise a winner. However, it is not but the story of rabid rage & ire, about the bee stinging the cobra's hood who then crushes both the bee & its own head under the wheel of a wagon to get her revenge no matter the price that really made me grin. That one's absolutely Shakespearean!",44,1 comment
21348,Aesops Fables,Francisca,183,83,3,"February 18, 2019","This is a collection of fables credited to Aesop, a slave and storyteller believed to have lived in ancient Greece. These stories, while at times naive at times strange, filled many of my summers, I as read them out loud for my grandmother while she was sewing or painting or doing one of the many things she loved to do with her hands.Originally belonging to the oral tradition, the fables were collected only three centuries after Aesop's death. The stories are focused on teaching moral lessons about love, and respect, and greed, and all those many internal demons pestering us. The allegories are great and rich. Animals are always the protagonists, perhaps because showing human behavior and actions --specially the despicable ones-- in the mirror of our beastly world-companions makes it easy for us to see the root of the evil in display.This is a good read for young children, but it's a surprisingly entertaining read for adults as well. One that requires little commitment for you can read one fable and forget the book forever, or you can read many and make an afternoon out of it.",30,N/A
21348,Aesops Fables,Marquise,"1,660",218,5,"December 14, 2015","This was the only book quite appropriate for my young age that I read as a child, a precious edition with lots of drawings by one of the best book illustrators, Arthur Rackham, which to date is still much loved by me. I have that old copy with me even now, relatively well preserved.",29,2
21348,Aesops Fables,Parmida R. A. ,95,76,3,"March 9, 2022","Aesop's Fables is the collection of short yet didactic tales that reveal the non-obvious side of human logic: the battle of folly and wisdom, prudence and imprudence. Prudence is the virtue whereby the best judgment is made based on considering circumstances and not just ideal principles.However, most of the time, the moral lessons attached to the fables are not relatable. The meaning of the story is within the story itself. As Flannery O'Conner once said, ""a good story is the one that resists paraphrase."" Fables are necessary to be read for children because they are ruthless yet frank depictions of reality that in them, things happen as they actually do, not in an ideal form. Fables are about the wisdom of the serpent more than the innocence of the dove. They show the world to the children the way it is: complicated and dangerous, but also full of wry and ironic events that reveal us and the nature of things to ourselves and correct our many failings, sometimes not so gently.So these didactic, compressed, and often wryly humorous fables perfectly capture the fascinating facet of the reality we often tend to ignore.",28,6
21348,Aesops Fables,Ahmed  Ejaz,549,324,5,"December 2, 2016","I think this is the book I can call a REAL masterpiece.   OVERVIEW  This book contains Fables. Each fable is different from the other and contains different moral. Author uses animals to convey his message. There are very few Fables in which he uses humans. But I didn't mind that fact. I just wanted a lesson. And I must praise author for such a great comparison between humans and animals. He has used an appropriate animal for a particular human characteristic. Overall this book contains almost every moral which we have or may face in the world.Or most important thing this book is purely for children. It would be an excellent book for them. Because almost teenagers are aware of the morals which are given in this book.  P.S.  After reading these Fables I don't think I am in the mood to read any more animals for a week or two.   SOME MORALS FROM THE BOOK I LIKED I liked almost every moral in this book but the following are little special for me.♡A change of habits will not alter nature♡There is a time for work and time for play♡The laws of nature are unchangeable ♡A fool may deceive by his dress and appearance, but his words will soon show what he really is♡Set your sails with the wind♡Ability proves itself by deeds♡Always stop to think whether your fun may not be the cause of another's unhappiness♡As long as you live, never judge the people by their looks♡Don't stop to argue with temptation♡You are judged by the company you keep♡The true leader proves himself by his qualities♡However unfortunate we may think we are there is always someone worse off than ourselves♡Greatness has its penalties♡Do not listen to the advice of him who seeks to lower you to his own level♡It is unwise to treat old friends badly for the sake of new ones♡Those who have plenty want more and so lose all they have♡Learn from the misfortunes of others♡Boast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well♡If you try to please all, you please none♡Do not count your chickens before they are hatched♡There is nothing worth so much as liberty♡Do not let anything turn you from your purpose♡Once a wolf, always a wolf♡Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example♡Misfortune is the test of true friendship♡It is easy to be brave when there is no dangerThanks for your attention! ^__^1 December, 2016",25,3

21348,Aesops Fables,W,"1,185",4,3,"December 24, 2020","Aesop was a slave in ancient Greece.He may not have created all these fables,but such was his fame as a story teller that any good fable was likely to be ascribed to him.When I was at school,there was an entire text book full of these stories.It was good fun to read and many of them stay in memory.Revisited this classic and enjoyed them again.There is plenty of wit and wisdom here.Such phrases as ""to cry wolf"" and ""sour grapes"" originated from these fables.Animals are used in most of the stories to depict the follies,cruelty,vanity,greed and other characteristics of mankind.A quick and enjoyable read.",19,N/A
21348,Aesops Fables,Caroline,"1,161",69,4,"November 11, 2016","Ok, so how many people have heard about these stories, but have actually read them? Not many, I think. But we all know stories like the boy who cried wolf, the hare and the turtoise and so on. Short fairytales about talking animals that teach us a lesson from an early age.I thought this would be a nice addition to my library, so I bought it. The book is about 450 pages long, but the stories are really short, from a few sentences to a couple of pages, so reading this doesn't take long. Even as an adult I don't think you should stop reading fairytales. Especially these which have important life lessons, plus fairytales can be very.. brutal. There are many deaths in these stories, so this may not be suitable for young children.The book has a lot of illustrations, and under each story you find the moral of it. It is a nice book, and absolutely worth the price if you're fond of fairytales.",17,1 comment
21348,Aesops Fables,Bettie,"9,988",15,3,"July 23, 2018","Description: The fables of Aesop have become one of the most enduring traditions of European culture, ever since they were first written down nearly two millennia ago. Aesop was reputedly a tongue-tied slave who miraculously received the power of speech; From his legendary storytelling came the collections of prose and verse fables scattered throughout Greek and Roman literature. First published in English by Caxton in 1484, the fables and their morals continue to charm modern readers: Who does not know the story of the tortoise and the hare, or the boy who cried wolf? They are two of the many fables from Aesop, made legendary by time. Trumpism is a collection of behaviours that can be summed up in their crassness with these fables - every day an exhibition of sour grapes, no?!",17,N/A
