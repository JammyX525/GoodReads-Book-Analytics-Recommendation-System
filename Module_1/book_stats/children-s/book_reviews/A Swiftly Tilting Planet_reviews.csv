77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Cait,380,11,1,"February 15, 2013","This is where this series entirely fell off the rails for me. (If you enjoyed this book, feel free to skip my rant! You are totally entitled to your own opinions!) I expected to enjoy this! It is a dear favorite of several of my friends. But no. I did not enjoy it. I loathed this book. Loathed. Let us begin with the intro! The gang is assembled again! Dad is advising the president! Mom is science-ing! Sandy is in medical school! Denys is in law school! Charles Wallace is doing a lot better in school and having exciting intellectual pursuits outside school! Calvin is presenting an important paper in England! Meg is pregnant. Seriously. This is the only thing we hear about her. I really appreciated, in the earlier books, that Meg is an intellectual equal in her family. She likes math! She's stubborn and has a tempter but she saves the day with her multiplication tables! In this book, the only mentions of what she is doing are that she is a) married to Calvin, and b) pregnant. AAAAAAAGH. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH. Then, we get in to predestination bullshit, wherein we first learn that the native population of presumed!America was perfect and peaceful and wise-like-yoda before the white man came and spoiled all that. Thankfully we had TWO white dudes, and they have helpfully color coded eyes, so we can tell who is good and who is bad for the rest of the book. (Blue is good, guys!) Also, for all the bizarre fantasy native population in the first bit, as soon as the white guys arrive, we move right back to white only characters for the rest of the book. (White characters who have a hint of exotic ancestry!) The plot hinges on which white guy is the ancestor of a crazy Latin American dictator- if it's the blue eyed guy, we're cool! If it's the brown eyed guy, nuclear holocaust! Events must be manipulated to ensure the correct lineage, so there is some time travel, some jumping thru space, a unicorn, etc. Charles Wallace lives in the heads of generations of men who: write some books, see some visions, fall down some stairs, go to Patagonia.Alongside these generations of men, there are some women! The women are pregnant. (Some see visions AND are pregnant! Some are stupid and pregnant! Some care for infirm male relatives AND are pregnant! Some marry abusive dudes and GET pregnant!) No female character is not explicitly a mother/pregnant as a plot point. (Mmm. Maybe Zillah- maybe she was only explicitly a fiancee/longed for, and her fertility didn't enter into it.) Ugh. Also: we once again have a book where the fate of all of humanity rests on a single family tree. Good things about the book: The idea of kything is pretty cool. ",101,26
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Leslie Ray,174,95,5,"January 21, 2020","I had decided to go back and finish the Time Quintet series as I had read ""A Wrinkle in Time"" when I was in school. I have really enjoyed #2 and #3 so far and am kind of glad I didn't read them when I was really young as I can really appreciate them more now.This one centers on Charles Wallace and Meg, who is now married to Calvin. His mother plays a big part of this story which involves the time travel and kything that were a part of the previous 2 books. Charles Wallace must go back in time, with the help of a unicorn (how cool is that) and realign events as he inhabits certain ancestors of a dictator, who in the present, is about to cause a nuclear war. We follow the adventure of Charles Wallace and feel through Meg as she kythes with him throughout the journey.Although these 5 books are all marketed to a younger audience, adults will enjoy them as well, if not more.

77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Trish,"1,845",3363,4,"March 31, 2018","This is the third book in the Time Quintet series that started out with Meg, her brother Charles Wallace and their friend Calvin.The third book starts with a massive time jump that almost disoriented me: the events here start 10 years after those of the last volume with Meg being married to Calvin and pregnant with their first child, Calvin being a scientist (and currently away in England), and the family has come together for a Thanksgiving dinner. Even Calvin's mother is there and when something peculiar happens and the family is informed that nuclear war has become a real possibility, it's Calvin's mother who tasks Charles Wallace with saving the future by giving him an old Irish rune (she doesn't actively know it).In order to do that, he recites the rune, thereby conjuring a winged unicorn called Gaudior.Together, they travel through time to certain moments the wind takes them to where Charles Walles merges with certain characters and experiences the moments in time through their eyes. It's about changing the past to ensure a peaceful future.At first, I thought this book would be even more heavy-handed than in the previous volumes. However, it was soon clear that it was done to actually criticize people like the Puritans that would have killed a woman for a witch in their religious mania just because she was different and they, basically, were bored. So I didn't mind. It actually had a mythological feel to it by a certain point.I certainly preferred this kind of quest to that of the previous book although we barely got to be with Meg or even Charles Wallce - it was more about the people Charles Wallce was ""visiting"" with Gaudior.The writing and audio were both, once again, very good. The author and narrator are both very talented and therefore the books are always of high quality - what influences my rating the most are therefore the repsective adventures. But now I wonder how these 5 volumes will come together in the end. Many things Meg and her brother learnt in book 2 have become essential in this third after the first book lay the foundation of who (mostly) this was about ... but how will it all come together, especially after such a time jump?!",32,4
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Alaina,"5,907",216,3,"March 17, 2018","Okay this book was weird.Charles is almost grown up because he's freaking 15 years old now. The twins are in like med school or something like that. Meg is married to Calvin and they are having a baby (OMG FANGIRL AND SWOOONING). Not really bummed that Meg and the twins weren't in this book as much, or that Meg wasn't on the adventure.. because Charles didn't really get to go on the last one. So it kind of makes up for it - right?Okay that parts not weird, the weird part was that Charles went to his star-watching rock, evil echthroi were trying to catch him, and then he finds a random ass unicorn and flies back in time. I'm sorry.. but what.. the hell just happened? From then on, there's a clusterfuck of confusion because I honestly had no idea who the heck was talking .. so I just kind of assumed it was Charles the entire time talking to himself. Yup. It made the book more interesting if I do say so myself.The adventure was okay. The confusion was very confusing and it didn't help that I was completely exhausted today either. I don't really understand why he even went on a trip with a unicorn to begin with. I also don't really understand why he was being chased. I just didn't understand a whole bunch of this book. I have no idea what the next book will have but I hope it's less confusion.Overall, the first book was probably the best and is probably my favorite. Still holding out the judgment though because there are two more books left in this shindig. Let's do this!",20,N/A
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,¸¸.•*¨*•♫ Mrs. Buttercup •*¨*•♫♪,650,325,5,"January 26, 2020","“The sky lightened, and the sun sent its fiery rays over the edge of the lake, reaching up into the sky, pulling itself, dripping, from the waters of the night.” I don't say this lightly: the first book of this series, A Wrinkle in Time, is my favourite book. Yes, my favourite book of all time. I had to reach the old wise age of 31 to find a book so wonderful, that it would make me say, without a doubt: I never ever read anything quite like this one. And well, I read three books in this series so far and I don't like them any less! Unfortunately, as it often happens, I have such a deep love for this series that reviewing it seems almost impossible. I have no way to describe the joy and wonder which filled my heart in some passages of this book, neither can I put in words the beauty of Madeleine L'Engle's poetic prose; her ability to transform words into rivers of colours, smells and taste. Her novels are like a drug for the imagination. And its beauty truly is moving; in fact this book almost brought me to tears more than once, just for the sheer beauty of some scenes (one among all, the birth of a baby unicorn). I can recommend everybody to read these books; but I don't guarantee that you all will love them just as me. I am perfectly aware that my liking for this series is very personal, and I feel like they speak to my soul. I want to read them over and over again for the rest of my life!",20,N/A
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Manybooks,"3,006",104,3,"July 22, 2022","So yes, when I read A Swiftly Tilting Planet (which is the third instalment of Madeleine L'Engle's Time Quintet series) late last night and early this morning, I not only sped through L'Engle's presented text with lightning speed (at least for me), I also did find (and continue to find) the basic plotline of A Swiftly Tilting Planet in and of itself wonderfully engaging and entertaining, with fifteen year old Charles Wallace Murry travelling through time astride the flying unicorn Gaudior in order to alter certain and particular aspects of the past and to thereby save Planet Earth from a nuclear war being threatened by a crazed South American dictator, and with a now married to Calvin O'Keefe and pregnant with their first child Meg being perhaps rather physically rather passive but still accompanying her brother in spirit via kything (and that part of the reason why I do enjoy the basic premise of A Swiftly Tilting Planet so much is that it is one of the very few time travelling middle grade novels I have encountered where going back in time to make the past different is actually depicted as something not only possible but also as required and necessary, that Madeleine L'Engle clearly describes the present in A Swiftly Tilting Planet as being dangerously tainted and deliberately put on a wrong path by cosmic evil, by the etchroi and thus desperately needing an adjustment that can in fact only occur by specifically altering the past). But while as a story, A Swiftly Tilting Planet has been really and much enjoyable (and in particular for my time travel novels loving inner child), as an adult reader, I have unfortunately also found some rather problematic textual problems with Madeleine L'Engle's narrative which prevent me from considering more than three stars for A Swiftly Tilting Planet. For one, I do find it rather strange and disconcerting that when the father (when Dr. Murry) at the beginning of A Swiftly Tilting Planet gets the official phone call from the Pentagon that the world is close to a nuclear holocaust, he and everyone gathered to celebrate Thanksgiving at the Murry house just seem to react with no emotions, and simply seem to continue with their Thanksgiving dinner (as come on, in the face of a global nuclear war, emotionality and a bit of depicted fear and dread would be much more realistic). For two, that time travelling (and unlike in A Wrinkle in Time) is suddenly as easy and as uncomplicated as Charles Wallace Murry riding his magical unicorn jumping into the wind, this does feel at best a bit of a textual let-down for me and as though Madeleine L’Engle is kind of running out of steam. And for three, and probably the main reason why the rating for A Swiftly Tilting Planet can for me be no higher than three stars is that I really do not at all understand why it takes a genius like Charles Wallace Murry such an incredibly long time to figure out the links between the similar sounding first names throughout the generations of Branzillos (as these are pretty ridiculously obvious and that for much of A Swiftly Tilting Planet none of the Murrays, not even Charles Wallace notices his, sorry, but this really does make me shake my head).",17,2
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Beth,"1,130",109,5,"March 14, 2018","Five stars for enjoyment and nostalgia and quality of writing. This is so, so formative for me. So many of the things I love in literature today are present in this book. A Swiftly Tilting Planet has runes and myth and might-have-beens, and it does time travel wonderfully. (Adult-me wonders if L'Engle was referencing Barrie and Dear Brutus with her might-have-beens; child-me had never heard of a might-have-been before.)This is lyrical and beautiful. And it still makes me desperate to see a model of a tesseract. Note: I just spent ten minutes searching my old journal for notes on the blue eyes/brown eyes aspect. I know I wrote notes on that a few years ago, about how it really rubbed me the wrong way. It didn't so much on this reread - but it's there nonetheless. This isn't a perfect book. But it is a really, really good one.I did find this, from a speech L'Engle gave:One time I was in the kitchen drinking tea with my husband and our young son, and they got into an argument about ice hockey. I do not feel passionate about ice hockey. They do. Finally our son said. “But Daddy, you don’t understand.” And my husband said, reasonably, “It’s not that I don’t understand, Bion. It’s just that I don’t agree with you.”To which the little boy replied hotly, “If you don’t agree with me, you don’t understand.”I think we all feel that way, but it takes a child to admit it. ",16,6
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Brian ,413,5,5,"September 7, 2020","""The world of trucks isn't as real to me as the world on the other side of time.""This one had a unicorn!Okay, maybe not that  unicorn.I had to turn off my adult, analytical brain, and access the child deep down inside me, the one that holds the capacity to wonder, to believe, and to learn, because the corruption of past has not tainted it. In other words, I had to let go of all I think I know. It provided an awesome experience! I remember the awesomeness and wonder of reading these as a child. I hope to contact that mind of innocence again.I remember, as a kid, I had frequent panic attacks. I didn't know it then, but I believe philosophers would refer to this as existential dread. I lay in bed at night (I remember the first time with vividness), and would think, and imagine. What if nothing existed. What if color did not exist, no black, no white, no something to contrast with nothing. Nothing. I felt my mind go somewhere else, and it terrified me, like I was losing my reality, losing my existence. Abnormal? Maybe. After all these years, I realized I didn't just make up those thoughts. I read them in this book. It amazes me the impact books can make on the human mind, especially the mind of a child.The story had that ""feeling"" I love, that otherness of reality, what Tolkien referred to as ""suspended disbelief."" I think something more lies within that feeling, something real. Again, abnormal? Maybe. I can tell you, though, I like it, and I want to be there. In fact, I want to stay there. Let's be honest, this reality we live in can beat you down and scatter your blood to the four winds. Its nice to go somewhere else for awhile. It's nice to believe in another, better world- some where, some place, maybe beyond world, beyond place, beyond time. I remember criticizing Borges in my heart because he didn't know if he existed. Now look at me. I should have criticized myself. Ignorance keeps us believing the reality we know, what we see, feel, touch, experience. We feel fine as long as we don't get uncomfortable with something we don't understand. Then, fear....So, the basic story-line: Famous Dad scientist gets a call from the President of the U.S. World War Three, and the end comes tomorrow. Sister's mother in law gives a poem called a rune, used throughout the novel. Charles goes to the rock in the field outside. Unicorn picks him up and takes him to several points in time to change the ""might-have-been."" This ties in with the end of the world with a grand crisis and resolution.""He rode a Gaudior who had become as tiny as a dragonfly, rode among the fireflies, joining their brilliant dance, twinkling, blinking, shooting over the star-watching rock, over the valley, singing their song, and he was singing too, and he was himself, and yet he was all he had learned...And he rode a Gaudior who had become as large as a constellation, rode among the galaxies, and he was himself, and he was also Madoc...flying through showers of stars, caught up in the joy of the music of the spheres... part of the harmony, part of the joy.""Can you feel that? Can you believe it?Part of the Trifid Nebula, The Unicorn",14,N/A

77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Christopher,139,13,2,"March 25, 2008","I hate to admit it, but getting through this book has been a bit of a chore. I'm not altogether certain if I want to finish this chapter of the ""Wrinkle in Time"" series, though I'm sure I'll press on because I bought the entire series and I want to get through it at least once. What is interesting about this book is that it introduces us to an adult (and very pregnant) Meg, and a teenaged Charles Wallace, who is the center of this book. After getting to know these two characters so well in the previous two books, it's a treat to see them as they get older. The fun is tarnished (for me, anyway) with L'Engle's storytelling device of putting Charles Wallace's soul or essence inside various other characters throughout the book, and dedicating entire chapters to random characters completely unassociated with the world of the Murrays. It feels like a kind of cheating on L'Engle's behalf - as if she were tired of writing about the Murray family and the quirky sci-fi creatures these books have become known for, so PRESTO CHANGO! We'll just cram Charles Wallace's soul into a few historical fiction characters and it can still ""technically"" be a ""Wrinkle in Time"" book. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh here, but I'm finding this book something of a bore, and I really wish it weren't the case.",13,2
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Tiff,568,539,4,"August 12, 2015","4.5 stars. Re-read. Spoilers abound. It amazes me how I can still be finding new things to think about and learn from in L'Engle's work even after 3-4 re-reads. The lyrical bits were a little harder to get through this time around - but no less beautiful. L'Engle has a gift for creating incredible characters - even though you only spend a short time in Madoc, Bran, Harcels, Chuck, and Matthew's brains through Charles, their stories drew me in. And can we talk about the fact that Chuck and Matthew are both probably two of the earliest physically challenged characters in juvenile fiction? I also loved how much this book gave a voice and compelling story to Mrs. O'Keefe - a woman who has several children and who isn't very likeable. Really, L'Engle did a ton of things right in this book that blends history, fantasy, time-travel...I'm still completely floored by her talent and work. ",10,N/A
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Neil R. Coulter,"1,045",97,3,"December 19, 2017","When I was a kid, the L'Engle's Time series was just a trilogy, so this was the final volume. On this re-read, as bedtime stories with the kids, I enjoyed the first volume, A Wrinkle in Time, and liked the second, A Wind in the Door, even better. This one, though . . . it's a different kind of story. Though L'Engle attempted a much bigger, more substantial story, it falls short in some frustrating ways.What's good about A Swiftly Tilting Planet: the language. L'Engle seems to have put much more into crafting every word of this book. She often uses alliteration, brings in some really interesting and unusual words, and infuses the sentences with a rhythm that I don't remember being present in the other books in the series. Reading it aloud was often a delight, especially for a family that loves words and good use of language.I also admire L'Engle for looking at a bigger canvas than before in her storytelling. This book includes extensive use of time-travel, as well as Charles Wallace going ""Within"" other people, in avatar fashion. Elements of this story hint at many other sci-fi stories that have come since. What doesn't work: too much, unfortunately. Though Charles Wallace seems to have some ability to influence the people he goes Within at the beginning, by the end he is lost in the narrative, seemingly not doing much to influence history. It's all a little puzzling--he's supposed to lose himself in the person he's inhabiting, but he's also supposed to repair something in time that went wrong. The idea that something in the future can be changed by making little changes here and there throughout the past is intriguing, but ultimately too simplistic to make a great story. It's also odd how in every generation there is a man from one particular family and a woman from another, who are destined to marry. How can these two family lines always produce people who marry, then after a few generations there is another couple that is distant enough in bloodline that they can marry, on and on? I found it puzzling.So, the plot is a little too much for a children's book. But the bigger issue is what's happened to the main characters in the years since the second book. Charles Wallace is, of course, still brilliant. The Murray parents are still geniuses who are on-call for the President of the United States. Calvin and Meg are married. Calvin, of course, is brilliant, like almost everyone in the book. Even the twins, Sandy and Dennys, the supposedly ""normal"" ones, not especially intelligent, are studying medicine and law, and are, of course, brilliant after all.You know who isn't brilliant and making an amazing career for herself? Meg. The protagonist. Who, it happens, is female. Instead of accomplishing astounding things in the world, Meg . . . is pregnant. She sits around the house, worrying about her brilliant husband, and being babied by literally every member of the family (""Meg, you shouldn't be outside, you'll catch cold!"" ""Meg, would you like some hot cocoa?"" ""Meg, shouldn't you be sleeping?""). It's ridiculous. Meg, who formerly was brilliant, is now just very, very normal, and apparently helpless. During this story, she lies on her bed, observing what Charles Wallace is doing. Sad.I like that L'Engle attempted so much with this story, but I'm disappointed with her treatment of Meg. Had Meg been the true protagonist again, instead of merely an observer, I would like the book a lot more.",9,N/A
77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Melody Schwarting,"1,368",78,5,"January 12, 2023","A Swiftly Tilting Planet is a bit more fantasy than sci-fi, and thus was more to my taste than A Wind in the Door. It is a bit disappointing that L'Engle builds fantastic parts of her world and doesn't revisit them in future books, but as I'm already a few chapters into Many Waters I can tell that she does flirt with them later on.A Swiftly Tilting Planet emotionally compelled me more than A Wind in the Door, too, with its expansive plot and continued question of seeing beyond the veneer to a person who can be loved.

77276,A Swiftly Tilting Planet,Carrie (brightbeautifulthings),809,29,5,"November 27, 2020","There were a lot of books I read well before I was able to understand them. I don’t think there’s any harm in reading ahead of our intellect, since it’s a way of pushing ourselves forward, but it undoubtedly affects impressions. While I don’t remember struggling with A Wrinkle In Time or A Wind In The Door in spite of their difficult concepts, for whatever reason, A Swiftly Tilting Planet went right over my head. Maybe it was all the time travel and the overlapping family lines, but I just didn’t get it the first time around. As I got older, I learned to love it as much as the other two, but it’s earned a new place in my heart and in my life.I don’t often get political on this platform. I have other social media for that. My blog is a place for bright and lovely things, and politics are rarely bright or lovely. But on election night 2020, this was the book I turned to for comfort. It is, after all, about a boy and a unicorn who go back in time to stop a mad dictator from destroying the planet. The stakes weren’t quite that high in America, but on a night when I was filled with fear and dread over the future of my country (and remembering the dread and sadness of our last presidential election), L'Engle brought me hope that people could choose kindness and goodness, that the smallest choices could have an impact if they were made out of love. I don’t often make sweeping statements about books “everyone” needs a copy of, but The Time Quartet would be in that category. In one way or another, these books have always been there for me, as books always are in our darkest hours.The world is on the brink of nuclear war, which could have a ripple effect on the entire universe. In order to prevent this, fifteen-year-old Charles Wallace is sent back in time with the unicorn, Gaudior, and his sister Meg kything from the present to try and alter the Might Have Beens that would lead to peace. He finds himself in a generations-old feud between two Welsh brothers, one who values peace and goodness and the other who seeks power at any price. Trigger warnings: character death, parent/sibling death, drowning, fires, severe injury, severe illness, abusive households, racism (some countered), ableism (countered), grief.The plot of Planet is somewhat more sophisticated and the story more of a slow burn than the previous two books, and it’s harder to follow. It’s taken age and multiple readings for me to track all the name repetitions and crossovers in the multiple timelines. (If I were a more enterprising spirit–or a better English student–I might make myself a family tree of the Maddox/Llawcae families, but I tend not to want to pause and work out details when I’m in a story that I’m reading for fun.) While making all the connections makes the organize-y part of my brain happy, it isn’t strictly necessary to understand the bigger messages of the novel. If Time examined things on a macroscopic level, spanning galaxies, and Door took a look at the microscopic level, Planet’s dimension is time and how one small thing affects another over decades, centuries, or longer. They’re a near-perfect complement to one another.The story is grounded in the much-beloved Murray family, and through Charles’s connection with Meg, the narrative returns to them time and time again like a touchstone. The other settings and characters shift frequently as he jumps among generations, which makes it difficult to get attached to some of them–-at least until I stopped seeing them as separate rather than a continuing pattern. This time around, I felt like I had a better sense of their individual stories: how Brandon’s connection with Maddok makes them stronger, how Matthew’s selflessness saves his family (and, further down the line, possibly the world), how Beezie’s life was a tragic victory for darkness. It’s more subtle, but it continues themes of love and connectedness that I enjoyed from the first two books. In L'Engle’s world, every small action matters and there’s always a chance for redemption.I review regularly at brightbeautifulthings.tumblr.com.",8,N/A
