I really liked the story, although it is a shame that the drawings miss color. Too much yellow/purple and black. This could have been so much better, but still 4 points.This book is in the 1001 Children's Books You Must Read Before You Grow Up challenge I am doing.",8,1 comment

270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Abigail,"7,083",173,4,"August 31, 2019","In this follow-up to his classic picture-book 
  Corduroy
, which saw a lonely stuffed bear exploring a department store at night, looking for a button, Don Freeman once again sends his adorable ursine hero on an unexpected quest: this time for a pocket. When Lisa, the little girl who took him home in the first book, brings him with her to the laundromat, Corduroy overhears a conversation that convinces him he needs a pocket. Never loathe to go exploring, he sets out to find one, becoming separated from his little girl, and having an overnight adventure in the laundromat as a result. Will he ever be reunited with Lisa? Will he find his pocket...?There's never much doubt as to that, in this feel-good picture-book, but that's OK - with its charming artwork and a winsome little hero, A Pocket for Corduroy makes for an enjoyable read, regardless. I didn't love it like I did the first, which was one of my favorites as a girl, but it was still a fun little book, with the same kind of fantasy appeal - what do those toys get up to, when we're not there...? - that made 
  Corduroy
 a success.",6,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Sharon Barrow Wilfong,"1,117",3942,5,"July 25, 2018","A timeless classic from Don Freeman, one of my favorite children's authors.The plot is the simple story of a little girl going to the laundromat with her mother. She brings her bear, Corduroy, who bored, decides to explore. He ends up getting left behind and spends the night at the laundromat. Small children have such a strong sense of wonder that a stuffed bear getting stuck in a laundromat over night is high adventure. I know because I remember loving this book when I was very young.",5,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Matthew,501,17,3,"August 23, 2016","To check out my review: http://dancinginth3dark.blogspot.com
  
    I wish this book was never written.
  
The entire time as I was reading this book I kept having this thought that Corduroy is going to turn into Chucky and kill the little girl. This bear creeps me out and this is meant for children. I believe the author could have written Corduroy as a standalone and you wouldn't hear any complaints for a sequel.We meet Corduroy again and he speaks like it is no big deal that a stuffed teddy bear can speak and communicate to humans. He tags along with his best friend and her mother to the laundromat to wash clothes. The girl puts Corduroy down on a seat and tells him not to move. Then he discovers that pants and jeans have pockets and he wants one. So he gets off the chair and explores other peoples clothes to find fabric to make a pocket.The girl starts to panic trying to find Corduroy but no luck because the laundromat is going to close soon and her mother has a zero tolerance for this type of dilemma and they leave the store and Corduroy is left behind inside for the night. He gets to explore the laundromat and unfortunately cannot find fabric for a button and falls asleep. Come the next day the girl returns and finds him and they live happily ever after as she sews a pocket for Corduroy.Can I mention again how creepy and weird it is that the girl accepts a talking teddy bear like it is no big deal? I know this book is a work of fiction but I cannot help myself think about the real world and if I met a talking teddy bear I would scream and panic. I love Toy Story, Ted, and countless other films that deals with personifying inanimate objects but I wish I will never see that happening in our real world. I was disappointed with this book and felt like it was written for the sole purpose of making money from the iconic first book. This is the last book in the series written by the author caused he passed away a few years later when he published this book and I've seen they have written countless books of Corduroy under other authors and I have no desire to read them. Until next time...",4,N/A

270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,JTownsend,22,1 follower,4,"September 17, 2017"," I liked the diversity in this book. It wasn't in your face, it just was. The human characters were likable and the reader could relate to their feelings and actions. The colors, patterns and textures depicted in the drawings encourage the reader to stop and examine them. This adds to the story. I wasn't as drawn to the character of Corduroy. If not for the supporting characters and the well done drawings I would have given this a 3 rating. I found the supporting characters more likable and inspiring than the bear. This story encourages us to look for beauty in the world around us and let it inspire you. If you don't notice it in the colors and textures or in the the beauty of the how the characters are drawn in relation to each other, the artist comes right out and says it, "" This would make a wonderful painting!...I can hardly wait to get back to my studio."" Corduroy is a creative thinker and finds inspiration in laundry soap, bags of wash and laundry baskets. It is a caring story. Lisa cares for Corduroy, Lisa's mother cares for her, the artist takes care of Corduroy and the manager is helpful to Lisa when finding Corduroy. Corduroy, well, he wants a pocket. Which he gets in the end. One with his name in it.  I would use this to inspire creativity in young children and to remind them to always let an adult know where they are. It would make a nice lead in to an art project or a safety lesson.",3,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy, Mummy Cat Claire,835,15,3,"October 23, 2019","I read this book to my child as it was listed on a homeschool study unit I have been following. Corduroy lives in the big city with his person, Lisa. Lisa tells Corduroy to stay put in a chair but he doesn't listen. He gets the idea that he needs a pocket and decides to look around the laundromat for one. What he finds is a bag of wet clothes and he is almost put into a dryer. After spending the night alone in the laundromat, Corduroy is reunited with Lisa the next morning. My child didn't really take to this story so much. We talked about big cities and how people live in apartments that don't have a washer and dryer. I don't think she got this concept. The story also has some bigger words. We had a worksheet that was cut and paste for some of the vocabulary words in the book. That was enjoyable. We also discussed cultural differences and occupations of people. Lastly, we tried doing a load of laundry at our house and this was fun.I would recommend this story for children who would be interested in learning about how to live in a big city with a lot of different people. The book shows diversity very well. Perhaps, the age of the book could be moved to up to 8. I don't think this story would be limited to just pre-schoolers. ",2,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Derek,366,18,5,"March 21, 2017","I don't know how many times I have read this book but it is probably the best book I have ever received (along with Are You My Mother). In fact, this is the first book I ever read. I remember the day my kindergarten teacher handed everyone a copy of the book, a pair of scissors and a glue stick. In retrospect, they probably shouldn't have given children a book and scissors at the same time, but no matter. I asked my mother to read it to me every night until I had mesmerized the story (which I did because I wanted people to think that I was capable of reading such an amazing book on my own). I still own the book and likely will for the rest of my life. (I also still have that pair of scissors and only recently threw away the glue stick).",2,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Mark Baker,"2,013",141,5,"June 22, 2015","One day while at the laundromat, teddy bear Corduroy decides he needs a pocket. His search for one introduces him to some strange new things. Can he find a pocket? Will Lisa be able to find him?Even as a kid, I liked this book more than Corduroy’s first adventure. I think it’s because of the creativity. We know what Corduroy finds along his way, but his explanations for them are creative, logical, and fun. The illustrations capture the book perfectly, and will please kids and parents alike. This is one all ages can enjoy.Read my full review at Carstairs Considers.",2,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Lindsey Wingfield,50,1 follower,5,"March 2, 2019","Review: I gave it 5 stars because it so detailed and imaginative. I think it gets children thinking about their toys and how they make them talk as well. The pictures and the text go hand in hand. The artistic elements add a lot more detail to the texts. This would be a book to read to students instead of them reading by themselves. Summary: Lisa and her mother are at the laundromat which is very busy at the time. Lisa brought her teddy bear corduroy while she helped her mother do laundry. Corduroy slides off the chair to go find something to make himself pockets. Lisa started looking for her bear because he was gone and the laundromat is closing. Lisa left corduroy there at the laundromat, he was then tossed into a drier with a young man's clothes. Corduroy fell out before the washer started and the young man undressed the bear and dried his clothing. After everyone left he played with some soap flakes and landed into a laundry basket, which he then fell asleep in. Lisa went to the laundry mat in the morning looking for her bear, when she found him in the laundry basket she asked him why didn't he just tell her that he wanted a pocket. They rushed home and she made him a pocket. ",1 like,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Hope Kim,50,2,4,"November 19, 2019","A Pocket for Corduroy tells the story of the same lovable bear only this time, he is looking for something different. Lisa, her mother, and Corduroy all go to the laundromat and Corduroy realizes his desire to have a pocket sewed into his overalls. Even though he is told not to go anywhere he starts to search for potential pockets and gets lost on the way. He almost spends the night in the laundromat until Lisa comes back to search for him. In the end, she asks Corduroy why he took off and he replied that he only wanted to search for his very own pocket. Lisa takes Corduroy home and sews him a pocket. This story is enjoyable for young children because it tells a story of the same and familiar bear. They will have a wonderful time reading yet another story about Corduroy and the adventures he endures. The story also teaches young children that rules are important and they should listen to their parents or guardians, if they do not there might be consequences. This important message is portrayed through a lovable and memorable story that children will love reading. ",1 like,N/A
270067,A Pocket for Corduroy,Becky,"4,980",91,4,"March 18, 2017","First sentence: Late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat. As always on such trip Lisa carried along her toy bear, Corduroy. Premise/plot: Corduroy is ""lost"" at the laundromat when he leaves the chair Lisa placed him in, and goes off in search of something to make a pocket out of. Fortunately, he is not washed OR dried. Though his overalls do come off! Corduroy has a unique way of seeing the world--and his take on laundry baskets and soap flakes is interesting. Will he get a pocket at last?My thoughts: I never knew about this one until I was searching for books published in 1978. I really enjoyed it overall. Lisa has a special bond with her best friend, and, she always understands exactly what he wants or needs. It must be nice to be Corduroy!!!Text: 4 out of 5Illustrations: 4 out of 5Total: 8 out of 10",1 like,N/A
