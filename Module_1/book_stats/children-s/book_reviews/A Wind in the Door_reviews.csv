18130,A Wind in the Door,Ana,60,286,5,"April 27, 2019","My second read in the time quintet!And oh boy, how much and why I still enjoy reading children books is just out of my grasp!Charles Wallace, our brilliant and intuitive 6 year old gets ill. He talks about things, that his elder sister Meg, finds impossible to exist. Do they really exist? Does their existence really matter?All of a sudden, it turns out that Charles Wallace's life is important for the survival of our universe. And somehow, Meg alone with the help of certain creatures, has to sort out ways to save her dear younger brother.The components used in the novel: time and size difference between two galaxies (earth and human body), the Proginoskes, Mr. Jenkins, The Teacher Blajney, Echthroi, Sposors and Yadah, all had very strong character development!Compassion, friendship, empathy, sacrifice, care and above all love has been taught as a lesson throughout the story. I believe not only children but sometimes elders should read such magical books to open the gates of our grown up minds to the possibility of impossibilities.Because a lot of lessons taught in this book are not age specific!“Don't try to comprehend with your mind. Your minds are very limited. Use your intuition.”The story tells us that we are nothing alone. Every particle in the universe exists to complement the other and nothing is complete within itself!That in the battle between good and evil, it is good that always wins, no matter how much difficult does it seem in the start!That you can change nothing into everything by the mere acts of love and acceptance!""The temptation for farandola or for man or for star is to stay an immature pleasure-seeker. When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good, we place ourselves as the center of the universe. A fara or a man or a star has his place in the universe, but nothing created is the center"" One other lesson this story teaches us is that we cannot have wings unless we are rooted! And we cannot enjoy the vastness of the skies unless our roots are deep down in the ground.It is true, small offspring. Now that I am rooted I am no longer limited by motion. Now I may move anywhere in the universe. I sing with the stars. I dance with the galaxies. I share in the joy-and in the grief. We farae must have our part in the rhythm of the mitochondria, or we cannot be. If we cannot be, then we are not.I loved reading this book as much I loved reading ""A WRINKLE IN TIME"".Undoubtedly, 5 happy, loving, dancing stars!",132,21
18130,A Wind in the Door,Andy,357,57,1,"December 18, 2012","Is it weird that I really loved A Wrinkle in Time and I fiercely disliked its sequel? I don't remember it being this bad when I read it as a kid, but bad it is. There are hints of the delightful whimsy of the first book, particularly in the Mr. Jenkins face-off and the ""classroom"" meeting with Sporos. But there are many more scenes of purported seriousness which aren't handled well at all. The climactic scenes, which I think were supposed to be moving and exciting, were unbearably ham-fisted and pretentious. Is there seriously a point where, to illustrate the value of love as a weapon against the bad guys, Calvin suddenly remembers some experiment he did on plants as a nine-year-old where he spoke lovingly to one plant and it grew better than the rest? New ""rules"" and random developments get thrown one after the other at the reader. Apparently you have to X yourself under certain circumstances. Blajeny has some kind of immense power but for some reason also must structure the battle for Charles Wallace's life as a series of prophesied tests which Meg (also for no clear reason) has to be the one to pass. ""Deepening"" is very important, in fact the centerpiece of the final struggle, but isn't mentioned until we're basically right there waiting for it to happen - it's as if Frodo goes to Mordor without an explanation as to why, and then all of a sudden at Mount Doom we find out oh and by the way there's some ring and it has lots of power and he needs to destroy it. Its predecessor was a lovely book and its successors are a bit better, but I found this book to be unbelievably disappointing. ",75,15
18130,A Wind in the Door,Trish,"1,845",3363,3,"February 28, 2018","This is the second book about Meg, Charles Wallace, their family and Calvin, their friend. There is no other obvious connection to the first installment other than that time can be bent and the children go on a sort of adventure through the universe.The universe, this time, is the great idea of everything lying within as without. For example, the galaxy is huge to us, making us tiny, and yet we are a part of it. So, too, are the smallest parts of us (like, for example, mitochondria) still a part of us and we are their galaxy.But again, all is not well in this book. Though Meg's and Charles Wallace's father is back with the family, there is great danger coming, namely in form of Charles Wallace getting sick from ""undoing""/""unbeing"". Help is coming, however, as in the first book. Here, in the form of a quite weird angel (cherubim) and a teacher.Thus, Meg and Calvin have to travel and pass certain tests and even travel into within Meg's little brother.Like I said, the idea (though not new) is done quite well. However, this second book in the series was much less light on the subject of religion (like the teacher that must never be questioned, don't ask ""where"", the teacher being all-knowing and all-powerful but not solving the problem himself etc.) and the entire philosophy of love being the eternal answer to everything ... well, that might sound nice in theory but is utterly ridiculous if you think about it. No matter how much love you throw at your enemy, if they don't have the same tactic, you're not gonna get very far. Just like with the concept of ""save one and you save them all"".In this context especially, it was about bullies. The children in Charles Wallace's class as much as the school's principal. While I can make allowances for misguided children, I certainly won't for an adult bullying children under his/her care!So yeah, while I can see this as a story about growing up and being faced with all kinds of problems in the world and having to learn how to deal with them, I don't agree with the solution presented here.The adventure itself, too, was rather bland when compared to the first. No idea why. It had some truly great and promising elements and the writing style itself was very good once again, too, but neither the quest itself nor the characters accompanying the children (especially the cherubim and teacher) were up to the challenge.",57,28
18130,A Wind in the Door,stephanie,"1,102",378,5,"June 8, 2007","there are some things, i think, that you read that will always stick with you. for me, one of those things is the scene in this book with progo, and the discussion he has with meg about the importance of naming. how once you are named, you are - no matter what. i read this later, again, in college, and i read it as a history student, and through that lens, it says fascinating things about the relationship of history and memory, and what history is, and how we leave legacies. like many of l'engle's books, the theological element is present without being completely clear - this was, in a sense, i think her attempt to answer the question of life after death, and also (as all her books question) how bad and good can exist together in a universe created by a loving god. the three mr. jenkins scene is pretty memorable as well, plus the idea of the little farandola in the mitochondria - her images are so clear and creative, such a wonderful blend of fact and fiction.

18130,A Wind in the Door,Ali M.,315,56,5,"April 6, 2010","I feel like this book is too often asked to be another Wrinkle in Time, when in fact its sparse cast of characters and relatively uneventful narrative seem like L'Engle's deliberate effort to make it the opposite. Wrinkle is all about recognizing the universal ""song"" of the cosmos, and stepping into it. A Wind the Door, however, is about recognizing the cosmos already inside the entity of the human being, and how our choices and sense of identity have an immeasurable effect on the song itself. L'Engle makes the point that biologically, we are a galaxy unto ourselves, and she brings this point home by literally reducing her main cast of characters to a molecular level. The bizarre metaphor works, thanks to some beautiful imagery and a palpable sense of world-ending conflict.Once again, there is endless insight into the nature of human relationships, good and evil, faith, science, identity, knowledge, and the subconscious. The concepts of Echthroi and kything are introduced, two ideas and words that have stayed with me since I was very young. L'Engle never writes without something important to say; part of what makes reading her so rewarding. And the older I get, the more her books speak to me. I don't think I'll ever stop returning to them.",38,2
18130,A Wind in the Door,¸¸.•*¨*•♫ Mrs. Buttercup •*¨*•♫♪,650,325,5,"January 19, 2020","“We don’t have to know everything at once. We just do one thing at a time, as it is given us to do.” You know when you read a book, you absolutely adore it and want so much more of it, and then it turns out it's a series so you pick up the second one and you are terrified it's not going to be up to your expectations? Well, it didn't happen to me with this one. I think the first book in this series is one of the most stunning books ever written, and I had so much faith in the author that I was sure 100% this one would be as well. And I was right. If you want to know what I think about this book, go check my review of the first one. But I should warn you: it's just the rambling speech of a woman in love. Man, do i love this series!!!",29,2
18130,A Wind in the Door,BAM the enigma,"1,765",352,3,"January 10, 2017","""Why do people always mistrust people who are different?"" I think I may have enjoyed this more than Wrinkle. More science-based And of course, a dragon can never go wrong with a dragon tale Also it didn't have that strange, abrupt dad ending like Wrinkle. ",24,N/A
18130,A Wind in the Door,Evelina | AvalinahsBooks,846,440,4,"September 19, 2016","A wind in the door starts out much darker than the first book in the installment - A wrinkle in time. While this one centers on the idea of good prevailing same as the first book did, I suppose it takes into account that the reader has grown a little since the release of the first book, and therefore comes across much darker than A wrinkle in time did (it's something we have observed with the story of Harry Potter as well).The thing I love best about the books of this series is how they treat children as.. just smaller normal people. They don't simplify the narrative, they expect children to be as smart as grown-ups (an idea a lot of children's books lack, unfortunately). We need to treat our children with the respect they should grow into - already seeing the child as smart and strong we want him to be, and not simplify the world for him so he has nothing to strive for. But enough of going on tangents. Onto the book.The Murry family lives in a world where good is always at battle with evil. They do not live in a mundane civilization we seem to live in, instead they are living in a world of breathing creation, fight for the good and prevalence of love and understanding over darkness and ignorance - a world of much bigger things going on behind our daily existence. This is shown not merely through the parents' scientific work to advance humanity, but their spiritual strength and the way they protect their children from this battle, and yet instill their virtues in them. This is where the book's 'spirituality' comes in - a kind of spirituality that could apply for any religion or tradition, although they tend to be thought of as Christian (a label I am not sure of - it seems more New Age for me).Meanwhile, the children take their own part in this battle while strange, magical things happen to them. I'm not going to tell you what happens cause you're not here to read my spoilers. But I'll say that I love how in this book all of the 'peace workers' (my term) do their work the way they think best. Like fighting different battles on different fronts - in the same war. And what it takes is ultimate belief in the ones wiser than you, using your heart over your brain and generally having a conscience - all things that reverberate through other literature of the more spiritual kind that I have read.Ultimately, this book teaches that you need to take everything the way it is, understand it and perhaps love it as much because of its weaknesses as its strengths. It teaches that if we want to be free from hate, we must stop seeing with the eyes of hate and seeing things that are darker than they really are. But at the same time, that seeing things better than they are is no better either. These are lessons every child should learn, and many an adult, cause most of us will have missed them when we were growing up. Apart from that, it teaches the importance of holding together and hints at how humans prefer to live egoistically and imagine they are the center of the universe. This is meant both in the sense of humanity as an item, and every single person that makes up humanity. It talks about how important it is to make the right choice about your life and your actions, and regrets the fact that many people are blinded by culture and just think of themselves.Read this to your kids. Read this to your own inner child.Some of my favourite quotes:""There are still stars which move in ordered and beautiful rhythm. There are still people in this world who keep promises. Even little ones, like your cooking stew over your Bunsen burner. You may be in the middle of an experiment, but you still remember to feed your family. That's enough to keep my heart optimistic, no matter how pessimistic my mind.""""When we seek our own pleasure as the ultimate good we place ourselves as the center of the universe. A fara or a man or a star has its place in the universe, but nothing created is the center.""""But a child-"" Mr Jenkins asked. ""Mod small child - why is he so important?"" ""It is the pattern throughout Creation. One child, one man, can swing the balance of the universe. In your own Earth history what would have happened if Charlemagne had fallen at Roncesvalles? One minor skirmish?"" ""It would have been an Echtroi victory?"" ""And woos history would have been even darker than it is.""",22,9
18130,A Wind in the Door,Christine PNW,671,193,4,"January 14, 2019","L'Engle project - February book.Meg & Calvin confront the opposite of something, which is nothing, with the help of Charles Wallace's imagined dragon, which is actually a cherubim, and the elementary school principal. Like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole, space and time, large and small, have little meaning when cosmic evil can act at a cellular level.This book is weird as hell, extraordinarily original, and deeply touching. Read on, bright and dangerous object.",20,N/A
18130,A Wind in the Door,kristy duncan,10,4,1,"March 15, 2009","I disliked this book so much it almost made me unlike a wrinkle in time. 1-no segue the first wasnt mentioned at all, not that they had already had an adventure, how she met calvin nothing!!2-monotonous the author really wanted her point to get across and though this book is for children I dont think it was necessary to restate the same concepts 8 and 10 times at least!!3-plot simply weak. where the first book was imaginative and interesting the first one limited and contrived. it seemed like she started with an ideology she wanted to beat into the reader and created a plot to go along with it as an after thought!In summation, im worried about the movie option for this book!",19,4
18130,A Wind in the Door,Spider the Doof Warrior,433,238,4,"September 17, 2015","I like this second best in this series, but the problem is why does Charles Wallace have to adapt to his school rather than the asshole who picked on him having to STOP PICKING ON A TINY 6 YEAR OLD BOY BECAUSE HE'S SMART? What is wrong with society that being smart is bad, but bullying is considered normal and something you just have to deal with.Bull! It shouldn't just be something to deal with. We should let people know that bullying is terrible and they need to stop doing it.Other than that, this book is very good and when you talk to a plant, it actually does grow bigger and healthier.

18130,A Wind in the Door,Christina,23,15,2,"October 20, 2008","Talk about strange... This book has a strange resemblance to an episode of the Magic School Bus where they travel inside one of the students... Only that was more believable. I think where L'Engle loses me is that she feels like she needs to explain everything - why not just leave it at - Charles is sick and we are going inside of him to fix what's wrong - see, I just said the same thing she did only she took half the book to say it. Sometimes its better just to leave it to our imagination. If you attempt to explain everything than there's no imagination left to it.I am not saying there is no imagination to this book - there is - it's just not nearly on the level of her first.And, I'm not sure what L'Engle was trying to do with pushing the idea of conformity. ""If your different - you'd better learn to blend in or your never going to make it""... I can see a kernel of truth to that - but I'm not sure that makes it right.",18,7
18130,A Wind in the Door,hotsake (André Troesch),502,6,2,"April 1, 2022",High in concept but very heavyhanded and filled with repetitive and secular dialogue.I will give the third book a try but if it doesn't get better I'm going to drop the series.,16,N/A
18130,A Wind in the Door,Mel,878,340,3,"June 27, 2016","I finished this book with 30 seconds to spare before the end of tbr takedown. 3.5 stars. I really liked this one more than book 1. I think this one was just more exciting and I cared about the characters a bit more. My only issue honestly is that this can't be a children's book. I BARELY understood what I read, so how can a child understand? Still unsure about continuing on the series. But it was better. ",15,2
