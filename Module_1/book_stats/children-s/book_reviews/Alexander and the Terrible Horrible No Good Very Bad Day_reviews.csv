46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,carol.,"1,501",7544,4,"March 4, 2018","Burned in my brain forever. First, because of the wonderful list of descriptors in the title, repeated throughout the story. I must have hit it at the right time in language development, because it stuck in my mind. I think I used that phrase ""terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day,"" for a couple of decades, usually in jest or as a way of mocking my drama. Second, because it was the first library book I ever lost. I'm pretty sure I was freaked out, but I remember the librarians as being nicely firm about it. Yet it remains a guilty scar.",66,10

  “It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.”
I read this to my little niece the other day, let's just say we weren't very impressed by this book. I get the meaning behind it and it's true sometimes you just have a Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day. Days where one thing after another go wrong and it puts you in a terrible mood but... still, I didn't like the overall negative feeling of this book. Really Alexander just came across as a little brat and was a bit annoying at times. I certainly won't be reading this one again and It's not one I'll be recommending either. It's just not for us! 
  “Some days are like that. Even in Australia.”

46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Philip,959,259,5,"February 19, 2011","I bought this book in 1989. Well, my parents bought it for me. There's a half-peeled-off sticker that says, MY BOOK in red bubble/block lettering with ""Philip"" scrawled on the name line. I was in first grade.I loved this book as a kid.I read it tonight to my daughters for the first time. I'm pretty sure they didn't understand the message that everybody has bad days, no matter where you are, but it was fun reading to them - all tucked in and what not.It was a nice piece of nostalgia for me, as well as making me picture myself as an adult and a kid at the same time. I wish I found a Junior Undercover Agent code ring in my breakfast cereal this morning, but I didn't. I didn't either, Alexander.(Granted, I did have coffee cake. One of the perks of growing up I guess.)

46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Calista,"3,791",31200,4,"November 8, 2018","I thought this book was an appropriate book to read. Alexander is having a horrible day. He wakes up out of sorts and the day is one big horror show. I think what I like most about this story is the end. The mother comes in and she doesn't try to make it better or make light of it. She says, some days are like that. Basically - this is life and it's ok. This is part of the human experience. That is the best part to me. I was sick yesterday, which is why I didn't post. I pretty much slept the entire day. I feel like I'm back in the land of the living today. It was a rough day.The artwork is black and white drawings, nothing fancy. The kids related to this story instantly. Both of them were relating stories of bad days. They both gave the book 4 stars. ",18,3
46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Spencer Orey,514,108,4,"January 19, 2020","I remember liking this book when I was a kid, but now it's kind of a downer. Like, I guess it's good that kids can empathize. There are going to be bad days. But still. Downerrrrr.",18,N/A
46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Ben,62,16,5,"May 27, 2007","""Some days are like that... Even in Australia.""This is one of those books that has so many levels (like a parfait, or an onion). It begs for multiple readings. On one level it is the story of Alexander, an ordinary kid whose day doesn't go as he wants it to. Yet it is also a treatise on the human condition - our selfishness and self-centeredness, the travails and hardships that assail each person's life, and the resolute courage needed to stand our ground and live our lives where we find ourselves, one day at a time. Even on the days we'd rather move to Australia.",14,N/A
46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Shelle Perry,480,30,5,"June 29, 2018","Alexander wakes up with gum in his hair and his day just goes downhill from there. His breakfast is no fun, his best friend has new besties and the shoes that he wants are out of stock leaving him with the plain ones, not to mention, he has a visit to the dentist looming in his future. His parents aren’t exactly sympathetic and it still isn’t over because before his day is done he is going to have to watch kissing on television and eat lima beans for dinner. (Actually, I think I got off easy. I HATE lima beans!!) The pencil and ink sketches by Ray Cruz are the perfect medium for conveying Alexander’s day.Alexander is an ‘every kid’ as the success of the entire series proves and this book is just a classic. Which is why it is still in classrooms and libraries all over the world after nearly fifty years because it perfectly captures the fact that bad days just happen sometimes, even in Australia.",10,N/A
46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Ronyell,956,319,5,"April 7, 2013","  “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” (whew what a title) is a children’s book by Judith Viorst along with illustrations by Ray Cruz and it is about how a young boy named Alexander who ends up having a terrible day. “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” is truly one of the most memorable books ever created!I have clearly enjoyed this book as Judith Viorst has done a great job at writing this book and Ray Cruz’s illustrations also contribute greatly to the story’s humor. Judith Viorst makes the story extremely humorous and creative as the book is narrated by Alexander himself as he tells the audience about the terrible day he is having and many children will definitely relate to Alexander’s situation as the situation appears from his own perspective. I also understand Alexander’s predicament since I had my share of bad days and I wished that I was somewhere else rather than the place I am at now when I am having a bad day. Ray Cruz’s illustrations are simply beautiful and hilarious, especially the image of Alexander with his matted hair and a scowl on his face all throughout the book. I also loved the black and white coloring used in this book as it reflects an old-fashioned feel to the story in a modern world.“Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” is truly one of the most inspirational books for children who have had their share of bad days and I’m definitely sure that many children will enjoy this book as much as I did! I would recommend this book to children ages four and up since there is nothing inappropriate in this book.Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog",8,5

46677,Alexander and the Terrible Horrible No Good Very Bad Day,Magpie67,895,99,5,"March 27, 2014","Truly the best children's book out there.... I first read this book when I was in elementary school and since then have read it multiple times to my children, the children I babysat and today to my mentee, a fifth grader who had never heard of the book before I mentioned it. I will never forget the day I walked into my Chemistry class quoting ""I'm having a terrible, horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day"" and have my partner finish it with me.... Kindred spirits. I use this phrase on those days when life is just to hard and I always end with ""think I'll move to Australia."" I own the book and will keep telling everyone I know to read it... A must!",6,N/A
