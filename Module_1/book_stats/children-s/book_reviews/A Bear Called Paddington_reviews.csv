160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Lisa,971,3332,5,"December 12, 2019","""Mum, do you remember when we read aloud each night?"" How many years did we spend, my three children and I, unwinding after a day of toddler, preschool or primary school adventures, by reading for an hour and a half together, cuddled up in a mess of arms and legs and stacks of books for different tastes and levels of understanding?Remembering those days fills me with inner exhaustion and absolute bliss at the same time. There were a few books that caught all children's interests at once while being enjoyable for me as well (like all of Astrid Lindgren's books, or Momo, or Narnia, or Oliver Twist, or Tom Sawyer), but rarely did I get the full attention of all three as long as when we read about the illegal immigrant Paddington, who stood out as different the moment he appeared at Paddington Station with a sign attached to his jacket: ""Please look after this bear!"" Are there still people like the Browns in the world, who are willing to accept diversity and strangeness, clumsiness and innumerable breaches of the conventional codes of conduct to engage with a lovable bear like Paddington - a bear who needs taking care of for sure, but who also adds incredible value to every situation he participates in?Shouldn't we read Paddington aloud again to our current politicians, who seem to have forgotten that empathy is the start of a good life, and that giving is the road to receiving joy?Please take care of the Paddingtons of the world, and you will get more than the Bear Necessities back!",72,23
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Mischenko,"1,012",97,4,"July 16, 2020","A Bear Called Paddington is the first book in the Paddington series, which highlights the adventures of a young bear who has migrated to London from Darkest Peru. After arriving, he luckily meets the Brown family who are more than happy to take him in, and this is where the fun begins. “Things are always happening to me. I’m that sort of bear.”My youngest daughter loved reading this book with me. It's such a delightful story with some silly, laugh-out-loud moments. Even without a plot the book kept our interest and we couldn't wait to see what mischief Paddington would get into with each new adventure. The illustrations are simple, but we loved them.I will say that these books may be a little advanced for my 6-year-old's attention span reading alone, but it worked perfect for a read-aloud together. We ended up grabbing the entire hardcover set and hope to finish them all. 4****",50,6
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Piyangie,504,360,4,"August 23, 2022","Dear Paddington, I've heard of you for a long time, so, it's such a delight to finally meet you. I enjoyed your adventures recorded here, and I think you're a really smart bear. I'm so pleased that you didn't disppoint my expectations. Looking forward to meeting you through your next adventures.",46,3

160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Bill,876,157,5,"August 3, 2022","Michael Bond's 1958 story introduces us to the wonderful bear from Darkest Peru. The adventures of Paddington Bear always put a smile on my face & can lighten the darkest of moods. Michael Bond establishes characters in this first book that stay with Paddington throughout all the stories that follow it.I've read a lot of books this year & will read many more, but for sheer joy nothing will beat a story about Paddington Bear.",34,3
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Trish,"1,845",3363,4,"January 1, 2019","The classic children's book about a silly little bear from Peru that is picked up at Paddington Station by a British family.Paddington isn't his actual name but nobody can pronounce his Peruvian one correctly, or so he says. Therefore, his new family is naming him, resulting in the quirky name so many generations of children have come to know and love.After his aunt is in a home for elderly bears, he is sent on his journey to England because his aunt expects him to have a better life there. And boy, does he ever. The little adorable clutz gets to write letters with real ink, eat as much marmelade as his stomach can take and meets all sorts of people. He even wins a painting competition!The story has clearly been written for smaller children but is enchanting for old(er) readers just as much. There is something chuckle-worthy about all the things that ""just happen to"" Paddington and how he completely up-ends the lives of the Brown family.It's a heartwarming succession of mishaps by an adorable culprit who also happens to be an immigrant (so the issue isn't exactly new) and a family growing together even stronger than before.(You know, jut from the initials, this could be MY suitcase. *lol*)No, I hadn't read any of the Paddington stories before so it was about time and after I heard that none other than Stephen Fry was narrating this fantastic new audio version, I was convinced that this was the perfect start to a new reading year.",21,9
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,GoldGato,"1,117",40,5,"June 7, 2022","Dear Mr. Paddington,I am writing this to you. And I hope that you will read it so you know. I guess I'm just another fan of yours, but I thought I'd write and tell you so.You made me love you. I didn't want to do it. No. I didn't want to do it. You made me love you, and all the time you knew it. I'm fairly sure you knew it. You made me happy, sometimes you made me glad. But there were times, sir, you made me feel so mad.I think you're grand, that's true. Yes I do. Indeed I do. You know you made me love you.Aw gee, Paddington, I don't want to bother you. If you don't want to read this, you don't have to. But gosh, you love marmalade! I love marmalade, too. I've never worn it like you, but one day I will try. And remember when you ruined Mr. Brown's painting because you were on a quest to discover an 'old master'? That was fun. And the way you carry your suitcase with you everywhere you go! Sure. Those are your memories of Aunt living-in-a-home-for-retired-bears Lucy. Paddington...if for any reason...well, if for any reason the Browns decide you can't continue to live with them, you can come here. We can eat marmalade together and wear old hats and drink hot cocoa with sticky buns. Just let me know. You're my favourite Bear From Darkest Peru.I don't care what happens, let the whole world stop. As far as I'm concerned, you'll always be the top! You know you made me love you.

160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Sandy ,348,10,5,"August 7, 2017","This summer, I am attempting to balance my reading with some lighter fare. This is the perfect antidote to the intensity of the winter's books. Fun, frolicking, fantasy! What a wonderful bear!",18,7
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Sita,108,59,4,"October 10, 2011","Wow. And I mean WOW. This is a children’s book, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone now, but it is a good book I can’t say I would recommend it to anyone now, but for children it is a fun, exciting read. I was in love with Paddington; I wished my parents would find a bear like that at the train station.  Mr Brown coughed loudly. “It doesn’t seem a very exciting story,” he said, impatiently. He reached across and poked Paddington with his pipe. “Well I never,” he said, “I do believe he’s fallen asleep!”That is one of the many reasons why I loved this book (as much as 8 year old me could love something).",15,2
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Elizabeth,831,46,5,"November 17, 2022","Paddington is a troublemaker, albeit a naive and innocent one! He's a bit like Bertie Wooster in that he's always getting into scrapes. My favorite involves height and a marmalade sandwich... Stephen Fry is the perfect narrator for this book. ",13,N/A

160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Peggy,295,131,5,"June 8, 2022","After seeing Paddington have tea with the Queen for the Platinum Jubilee (and at last finding out what Her Majesty keeps in her ubiquitous handbag), I thought I should read this. ",12,N/A
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Chrissie,"2,647",1486,2,"August 8, 2018","This is a story for a child, not for the adult reading to a child. It comes nowhere near A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories. Isn’t it best when both the child and adult get a kick out of the shared reading experience?The writing is ordinary, as is the content of the stories. What is drawn is a child’s world. A day at the beach, a birthday party, doing magic tricks. For a child, there may very well be delight in the ordinary. An inordinate number of calamities arise, all due to unintentional mistakes. Isn't this too typical of the life of a child?! The mistakes are smiled at and forgiven. The tone is kept light and cute and sweet. For a young child, the book may be fun, reading about a world they recognize. Paddington is a small bear, just as they are. He may be from the Darkest Peru, but he sees the world as they do.After an excursion to London, a child may enjoy the book. Remembering mammoth escalators and elevators and the flea market on Portobello Road. The excitement and bustle of the place.I am trying very hard to figure out what is good about the book.Yet I am an adult. I find it childish and boring. I see no flair, no imagination and little creativity.As I see it, the charm of Paddington is in the visual, in seeing him on the screen. His movements. His demeanor. Not the ordinary things he says and does.I listened to the audiobook read by Stephen Fry. Set in London, I thought it being read by one with a British accent would be appropriate, and it was. He speaks clearly. A child will have no trouble understanding, but yet again, the reading was all very ordinary. I like a little spark to a story. There is none of that here.",11,2
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Steven Walle,354,121,4,"January 21, 2019",This was a very good children's book. I remember it from my childhood. It is a very cute little story.Enjoy and Be Blessed.Steven,10,N/A
160629,A Bear Called Paddington,Luisa Knight,"2,717",651,5,"January 8, 2019","Oh. my. cuteness!This book has entered into my top favorites for young kids and books to recommend for family read-alouds. The narrative was top notch and as smooth and as delectable as sweet cream. And Paddington and the Brown family: simply the nicest, most endearing host of characters you'd ever want to know. Read it. You and your kids will LOVE it!Ages: 5+Cleanliness: for goodness' sake, goodness gracious, Mercy, Gosh, and Crikey are used. Mentions a man smoking a pipe. Paddington tries to perform ""magic"" tricks - he is only reading a book on tricks and attempting them. **Like my reviews? I also have hundreds of detailed reports that I offer too. These reports give a complete break-down of everything in the book, so you'll know just how clean it is or isn't. I also have Clean Guides (downloadable PDFs) which enable you to clean up your book before reading it! Visit my website!",9,1 comment
