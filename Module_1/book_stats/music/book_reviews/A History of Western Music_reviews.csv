194527,A History of Western Music,Josabry,22,1 follower,5,"August 6, 2007","So, let me be honest. I read this book to pass the Praxis exam for music teachers. It took about four months to read, and I ended up buying four other books to use as references, most of them music theory books.I learned more about music from reading this book than I had in the twenty-nine years and eight months prior to picking it up. It was just amazing. His writing style is very dense - when I say four months, I mean four months, several hours a day of reading, note taking, cross referencing and plunking on the piano to hear what he was talking about. But it was well worth the time invested. And not just because I passed the Praxis. :)",1 like,N/A
194527,A History of Western Music,Alex Kartelias,210,69,3,"January 1, 2015","The sections on Greek and Rome music theory and philosophy was fascinating- as well as the troubadours during the middle ages, and the short bio's from some of the composers from the baroque, classical and romantic periods- but the music theory for most of this book was just long and drawn out. This is not a book to read if you just want an overview of composers and famous classical pieces. The information goes into a lot of depth. But, for those who are music majors, reading this book will be very beneficial.",1 like,N/A
194527,A History of Western Music,Kathryn,22,5,5,"March 7, 2009","Everybody else in my class hates this book, but I think it's wonderful. It does go into a lot of detail about the form and structure of specific pieces. But even that information can be useful and interesting. If you want a resource on music history, this is great. It provides great historical context for the development of musical eras and genres, and makes lots of parallels to literature and art too. ",1 like,N/A
194527,A History of Western Music,elstaffe,747,2,4,"June 22, 2017","A good introduction to the history of Western music, assuming that by ""Western"" they mean ""mostly white men."" Still, a good starting point from which to dive off into bits of musical history that were whitewashed or carefully curated over, not just in this book but in most histories of Western music.Took me five years but I conquered you, HoWM!",1 like,3

194527,A History of Western Music,Lynn,447,6,5,"April 29, 2021","I owned and studied through the first edition of this when I was a student. Somewhere along the line, I acquired the 3rd edition (1980) and have it on my bookshelf but have used it only to look things up once in a while.This link is to the 7th edition. The current edition is to the 10th edition and costs $125 if you want a new one or can even get it. Such is the way with textbooks these days.Instead, I got the 8th edition from the library, which covers things up to about the year 2010, the beginning of the streaming era. Given that it starts with music in the 9th century (or earlier if you count the little bit that's known about Greek music and even less about Roman music), that's a pretty big chunk of art music to cover. The 8th edition is well over 1,000 pages, including final notes, Further Reading, and the index.I have a strong background in classical music all the way back. I didn't need to read this as new information, but as reinforcement, to help me put things into perspective, to help me remember who follows who and when.In the first edition, hardly any mention was made at all of music in the twentieth century, as if it was not anything worth bothering with in a history of Western music. It also does a good job of clarifying what is meant by the term classical music, which is context dependent. Most people who know music understand what usage is meant. Today it refers to a certain tradition and attitude that solidified starting early in the nineteenth century. Before that, music was regarded as more disposable than it is today. After that, a stable repertoire of masterpieces developed along with standardized ensembles dedicated to playing it. Still, there has been a steady stream of composers who have written new music in that tradition, even though their sounds may be vastly different.The eighth edition does a commendable job of correcting the omission of the twentieth century (which was still only about half over when the book was published). It must be admitted that the greater part of what is interesting in art music in the twentieth century and until our day has come from developments in music in the United States that have propagated themselves. In this, we have the folk music of slaves and farmers, the development of jazz as a true art music, and many, many other forms of music that today all seem almost equally important with one another. And to that I happily say: Let it be!",N/A,N/A
194527,A History of Western Music,Benjamin Fasching-Gray,692,12,5,"April 21, 2020","I absolutely loved this book. It's just all love. Even when a particular person or time period is brutal or dark, the focus is on the music and so it stays just lovely. The people who wrote it, they seem to like all music no matter who, when or where. This isn't just the stuff you hear on the classical radio station, it's everything. This 6th edition makes a real effort to go broad and I think it succeeds, including women composers and musics from marginalized peoples wherever they can be found. It took me just about a year to read it, periodically stopping to listen to some of the music they were talking about. Sometimes the theory stuff got a little difficult for a non-musician like myself, but there is a glossary in the back. Bits of sheet music throughout would have given the opportunity to sit at a piano and actually puzzle out the chords or intervals they are gushing over but I didn't nerd out that hard. Where I did nerd out though? of course: the 90 plus pages of suggested further readings!! I love that kind of thing! This might be my favorite book ever!",1 comment,N/A
194527,A History of Western Music,Carl,10,1 follower,4,"February 21, 2022","I’m grateful I took the time to explore this history and its many companion recordings. I’d never taken any kind of music appreciation course before, much less music history. It was mind-blowing. From the obvious things I didn’t understand (“Why is there hardly any music surviving from before ~1100 AD? Ah — musical notation hadn’t been invented yet; or the printing press”) to big revelations — especially around female composers of chamber and orchestral music, dismissed in their day due to sexism, who are finally being rediscovered, and getting their due. History of music, like history of Art, like history of literature, is history itself. It captures the spirit and values of its time. Four months of immersion in this book was a joyful journey. The only reason I’m giving four stars is because it should be two volumes, but I guess I’ll have to do the further exploration myself.",N/A,N/A
