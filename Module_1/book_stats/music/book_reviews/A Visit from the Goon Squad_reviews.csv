7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Patrick Brown,141,2458,5,"August 24, 2010","Spoiler alert: You will get old. You will die. Things will never be like they are right now. And yet, how things are right now will determine how they are in the future. This is so.The ""goon"" in the title of this book is time. It opens with a quote from Proust, the poet laureate of memory, about how we cannot recapture the people we were in past the places where we were those people, but rather that those people exist within us, always. And that, it seems to me, is more or less the book, in a nutshell. But, oh, how it gets there. How the story unfolds -- stories, really -- is breathtaking. This the best book I've read this year.A collection of narratives -- they aren't really stories -- centered around various record industry denizens -- an aging producer, his assistant, her college best friend, the producer's mentor, his wife's brother, a publicist, etc. -- Goon Squad is a novel about lives. It opens with Sasha, the beautiful, troubled assistant to record producer Bennie Salazar -- and continues on through a host of characters who knew them. And knew is the word here, for the lesson of the book seems to be that we are not the same people we were before. Those people are dead, and yet the people we all became -- the sagging, sad, tired, knowing people we are now -- those people are inextricably tied to the people we were. We are simultaneously incapable of recovering what was lost and yet bound to know what it is that we're missing.Does this sound like the book is horribly, horribly sad? It isn't. It's beautiful and clever and very smart, and, okay, a little bit heartbreaking. One of my favorite aspects of the book is how it deals with technology. Facebook, in the novel, is a kind of memory, excavating lost lives from the ether, reconnecting people with the people they were before...or at least the people they knew before. And in the end, it's a burst of horrible, relentless technology that seems to save the music business. And one of the most powerful chapters of the book is told in powerpoint (To wrench soul from the teeth of a Microsoft product is truly a feat unto itself). In fact, this book may be one of the most subtly speculative works of fiction I've read. It presents a future near enough to include all of us, close enough to be recognizable, and still strangely different from where we are today.I realize this review dances around the book. It tells you what the book is about without really telling much of what the story is. And that's because the story of the book wouldn't sound like much on its own: Some people grow up. They work in the music business. Their friends die, and then so does their business. But those people keep going. They have lives and love affairs and children. They make new friends and rediscover people they assumed were dead. Their lives cross with one another in myriad ways. And then they cross again. I keep returning, again and again to the section on Jocelyn, a girl who ran away from home to be with a record producer, a man who spit her out almost before he was done chewing her up. The passage is on page 65, and it's one of several haunting paragraphs in Jocelyn's section:""We stand there, quiet. My questions all seem wrong: How did you get so old? Was it all at once, in a day, or did you peter out bit by bit? When did you stop having parties? Did everyone else get old too, or was it just you? Are other people still here, hiding in the palm trees or holding their breath underwater? When did you last swim your laps? Do your bones hurt? Did you know this was coming and hide that you knew, or did it ambush you from behind?""This book, it ambushed me.",696,48

What.....were.....they.....thinking????? Oh, I forgot, they weren't!When did the Pulitzer become the Puke-litzer? I'll never again trust that prize designation except with books from a long time ago. Don't be fooled by the first chapter, which is not too bad. Sort of an interesting start, about a kleptomaniac aging punk rock chick. After that, FORGET IT! Dumpster filler. A lot of people make a big mention of the PowerPoint section of the book. Cool gimmick, right? But as far as I'm concerned, there's too much emphasis in the book on (cough cough) power ""points"" in general, if ya know what I mean. Left a bad taste in my mouth, and in the mouths of some of the characters, no doubt. So aside from the gamahuche and other potency obsessions, there's a lot of cocaine and 'ludes and really bad punk rock song lyrics. Oh, and a lot of really annoying, unlikeable characters who seem to substitute therapy for actually getting on with their lives.I wouldn't have been so hard on this book had it not been given such a prestigious award. I never would have even tried to read it if not for the Pulitzer. Since when did gimmicky books with no substance merit consideration for literary awards? Was this really the best they had to choose from? I doubt it. I'm now fully convinced that the Pulitzer Prize has become a purely political handout dropped into some lucky writer's trick-or-treat bag. BOO!! ",660,125
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,karen,"3,968",17000,5,"June 24, 2018","hell's bells. believe this hype.this book is the saddest, truest, wisest book i have ever read in a single day. which is not to belittle it - my tear-assing through it is because i did not want to stop reading it and resented any interruption that tried to get in my way. i am someone who plans things. i have timetables in my head - i have to, in order to get everything done. nothing important, just ""at 8:00 i will untangle my necklaces while i watch my netflix. at 10:00, i will fold my laundry and then pay bills, etc etc. this book ruined all of my good intentions. i read straight through one mental time-allotment after another, leaving dishes unwashed and e-mails unanswered. and i did not care one bit. as i read, i kept thinking, ""this is exactly right - this woman gets it, this is just what i was talking about the other day."" because karen has been doing a little bit of dwelling lately, and this book really captured so many universals of youth, adulthood ...and the rest. she knows just how to twist the knife.everyone has been praising this book since it came out, but all i knew going into it was that there was a powerpoint chapter and a dfw chapter (which i had already read, at greg's command, months ago). i didn't even know they were stories that combined to show facets of people's lives in different times and places and stages and manifestations. i didn't know who would attain closure and who would fade away, i just thought it was another book by the lady who wrote invisible circus. i had read invisible circus years ago and had been unimpressed, and then i start hearing all this talk about look at me and how it is this incredible book, but i looked at the cover and i thought - ""no, thank you"".i am pretty sure i bought the keep, but it got sucked into one of the stacks here, never to resurface. but then this comes out and greg and tom fuller are praising it to the heavens, and then tom gives me his copy to have forever, so i pretty much have to read it. i do not disobey my work-dad.and as always, father knows best... i have never seen crash because ""they"" tell me it is retarded, but i did see 21 grams and babel and amores perros and 11:14 and all of those others - disjointed narratives where one thing affects another thing and it's all connected, man... (amores perros is the only one you need to see from the above list), but how often does it really work, and how often is it just flashy storytelling to compensate for lack of a true plot??it's the same in the litworld. i thought michael cunningham's the hours did it really well, and this - well, this makes it work perfectly. because it is less about the impact an action has upon others than having the opportunity to understand a character's motivations from witnessing snapshot-chapters from different periods and the -oh god not again - it is like a sneeze - zeitgeist of the pop cultural (punk rock-ical) and historical climates of these poor broken characters.but elizabeth - it is not a downer!! it is not one of my ""downer books"". it is more... gently nostalgic. and bewildered. definitely bewildered.""she was thinking of the old days, as she and bennie now called them - not just pre-crandale but premarriage, preparenthood, pre-money, pre-hard drug renunciation, preresponsibility of any kind, when they were still kicking around the lower east side with bosco, going to bed after sunrise, turning up at strangers' apartments, having sex in quasi-public, engaging in daring acts that had more than once included (for her) shooting heroin, because none of it was serious. they were young and lucky and strong - what did they have to worry about?? if they didn't like the result, they could go back and start again."" i mean - gutpunch.this kind of blithe optimism is exactly what touched me when i was reading 
  shiver shake
. remember being indestructible?? i sure do. this is also one of the few works where 9/11 is used tastefully and more or less subtly, and the absence of the buildings is worked very well into the pervasive loss that holds this book together. the NYU chapter is greg's favorite, and it is both heartbreaking on its own and bittersweet for me because it could have very easily been me. i remember sunwarmed fire escapes between classes and bobst and for me it was mamoun's falafel, but regardless. it was both familiar and far away. i liked the naples chapter best, because for me it is storytelling 101 - a perfect story and the last line kills me because ""muttered"" is the best possible word there, and it complicates what could have been a very easy and pat ending. jennifer egan i luvs you.come to my blog!",376,89
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Lisa of Troy,375,2778,5,"October 30, 2022","Standin’ on your mama’s porchYou told me that it’s last foreverOh, and when you held my handI knew that it was now or neverThose were the best days of my life-Bryan AdamsHave you ever had a defining moment, one where you knew it was important, where you wanted it to last forever, wanted to keep it in your hand or your pocket but knew in that instant that it was floating away, through your fingertips? It might be someone that you met in college, who you connected with so strongly emotionally, but you knew that things would never work out. You have that moment, future not guaranteed. That is what A Visit From The Goon Squad is about. It is about time, moments that are slipping away. Egan writes so clearly, so beautifully that A Visit From The Goon Squad is soul stirring.At the outset of the novel, we find Sasha, struggling with kleptomania, battling an overwhelming desire to palm and steal objects. She describes the beauty of an ordinary screwdriver, shining, sparkling. After she obtains the glorious screwdriver, it seems so ordinary. I can’t help but think that this is a metaphor for life. How often do we reach, aim, and stretch forward towards a goal? If only we accomplish X, everything in our lives will magically fall into place. Then, if by some miracle, we magically achieve X, we discover that there is no magic elixir in life. But those moments before achieving the goals, aren’t they beautiful? Isn’t it exhilarating to have that fire in your belly, that burn in your soul, that driving force that bolts you out of bed in the morning? The achievement is nothing compared to the ride.One of the recurring themes in this book is music. In some ways, the music industry has changed tremendously. However, music is also still music at the end of the day, especially live music. If you haven’t already, go to YouTube, type in Mr. Tambourine Man (Live at Newport Folk Festival. 1964). This is just Bob Dylan, one man singing, playing the guitar and harmonica. There are no backup singers, no glitzy lights or costumes. This is just raw, pure talent. When you listen to live music, it exists in that moment. Even if you whip out your Smartphone and record the moment, it still won’t be the same. You won’t be able to feel the strum of the guitar or the deep boom of the bass reverberating throughout your body. If it isn’t obvious, A Visit from the Goon Squad is deeply moving.

7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Greg,"1,106",1802,5,"September 17, 2010","This is the best book ever that has a whole chapter done in power point. I hate power point. I think it was invented by the devil and given to humanity to make us even dumber than we are now. I think teachers who use power point should be hog-tied by their intestines and then sodomized by Mary Lou Retton (and probably people in the corporate world too, but I don't know about that first hand, but I'm sure they deserve even worse). I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate power point, but Jennifer Egan can do a whole book in power point and I'd it would probably be more effective than most normal novelists are with whole pages filled with words at their disposal. Back in November 2009 I proclaimed the ARC of Jonathan Dee's The Privileges the best novel of 2010. There are a few books that have come out that I haven't read yet, but which may be better (Citrus County is one that I think might) but I now know that this book is just as good, if not better, than Dee's. This book has a) a lame cover, b) a lame jacket description, c) a chapter kind of poking fun (jesting?) at DFW's writing style, and d) a chapter written in power point; but still with all of these apparent negatives the book is awesome. I'm not going to try to sell you on the book. Coming from a punk background I know that too many people liking something inherently diminishes the enjoyment one can get out of something. Since Jennifer Egan is already a fairly popular author, and me already being late to the game with liking her (for years I thought she was Janet Fitch, I knew they were different people, but I thought they were synonymous with each other) I can't risk you or anyone else that hasn't already read her finding out how great she is and stealing some of my precious enjoyment from me (for example it's a scientific fact that people who listened to Green Day when they were on Lookout! in 1993 enjoyed 97% more than they enjoyed them 12 months later in 1994 when everyone liked them. The enjoyment ratio flew way down and the music essentially didn't change. There is only so much enjoyment in the world to split up, fortunately there is an infinite amount of pain and sorrow so we can all partake in that). Anyway, now that I've gotten that pesky talking about the book out of the way. Let us turn to one of the points in the power point chapter. For those of you who haven't read the book, and will not read the book and steal my enjoyment from me; the chapter deals with a family. The daughter of the family is the narrator, or constructor of a power-point journal. Her younger brother is semi-autistic. He has a thing for silence in music. Pauses. He makes loops of the different silences, he graphs them for duration and effect. And there is a fairly interesting description of different pauses in the history of rock music, but with two of my favorite examples left out, and with one artist who made too much use of them, but who used them effectively also left out. One. The best use of the pause in music (well in punk music) is in the Sex Pistols song ""Bodies"". That NOFX is mentioned in the chapter and ""Bodies"" isn't, is well a travesty. While it's not as surprising a false-ending as ""Please Play This Song on the Radio"" or as quirky / funny / jokey, it is more effective for punk pathos. I read once in a book (I think it was England's Dreaming) that the sound of the Sex Pistol's imploding was captured at the end of ""Belsen was a Gas"" during their last show (in my reality they never re-formed, so we are talking 1978 here), when there was just silence for a second. That silence was preceded by the one in ""Bodies"" though where all of the fury was released in a string of almost nonsensical uses of the word fuck. Two. Sunny Day Real Estate, ""Seven"". Here the use of short almost micro pauses and one slightly longer pause work to create a expectation, excitement and anxiety. One could argue that there are not pauses in this song, but that argument is wrong. Maybe it wouldn't fit in the dynamic of the chapter because it would be very difficult to capture the pauses to sample them. More mention should be made of the first Sunny Day Real Estate album. Three. Matthew Sweet. The man made an art out of the false-ending. He deserved to be mentioned in a chapter dealing strongly with pauses and silence in rock songs. I'm not a huge fan, but he should be given a mention. Hopefully this aside has convinced you to not read this book and allow me to enjoy it more than if you stole some of my pleasure. ",178,107
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Nataliya,710,11300,5,"April 27, 2013","Time is a strange old fella, isn't it? It creeps up on you and changes you bit by bit until you the new you and the old you are barely more than strangers to one another.You can see time as a continuum, a line stretching from the past into the future, a long straight road to travel along with occasional proverbial 'road not taken' splitting off to the side - where barely perceptible changes accumulate one by one. Or else you can look at it as a series of snapshots, a deck of cards randomly and carelessly shuffled, each one showing a face different from the rest - life in snapshots. And these snapshots are so different from one another, separated by the years of smart choices and poor choices, pain and happiness, gains and losses, laughter and tears, having formed an invisible network of scars that forever preclude us from following that once-long-ago good-natured yet impossible advice of 'Please don't change; just stay the way you are!' - the promise we can wholeheartedly make but no matter how hard we try we cannot keep.
  ""Alex imagined walking into her apartment and finding himself still there— his young self, full of schemes and high standards, with nothing decided yet. The fantasy imbued him with careening hope.""
I still can easily remember being sixteen, not knowing anything besides the blissful strong-willed ignorance of youth, where everything was just beginning, everything was still about to start, nothing was decided yet, and the world was one giant untapped possibility with no way of telling where time will eventually take you. But time goes on, and now I can almost see thirty from this point in life and occasional gray hairs are creeping onto my temples (yes, I know - thirty is the new twenty and all that bullshit we tell ourselves to feel younger and preserve that feeling of endless, overwhelming potentiality and possibility that we so took for granted half a life ago), and there's not that much connecting me to that girl in the Land of Ago (to borrow Stephen King's phrase). Time passes, and with it we change, slowly and subtly but unavoidably, until one day, just like a character in A Visit from the Goon Squad notices, we stop being ourselves 'without recognizing it'.
  
And then maybe we learn to appreciate the pauses in songs, like a young autistic kid the glimpses of whom we see through a powerpoint presentation made in the future by a 12-year-old girl (oh dear, how much do I loathe the inescapable omnipresent powerpoints that have reduced public speaking to mindless reading of slides!) - because they make us think the song is over, and then it restarts and we get a temporary reprieve from the end, the real end, and it's that giddy feeling of almost having cheated the inevitable, of having gotten away with something at least for a while longer.
  They resumed walking. Alex felt an ache in his eyes and throat. “I don’t know what happened to me,” he said, shaking his head. “I honestly don’t.” Bennie glanced at him, a middle-aged man with chaotic silver hair and thoughtful eyes. “You grew up, Alex,” he said, “just like the rest of us.”
This is a book about losses and regrets as people change with time - as well as glimpses of personal redemption, especially in the threads of the story connected to Sasha (who I really started to love after the NYU chapter - because how can you not?). It's a book full of little often unseen connections between the characters who have touched each other's lives in the ways they may never understand.
  ""Redemption, transformation — God how she wanted these things. Every day, every minute. Didn’t everyone?""
This book is about people connected by time, connected by music, with moments in life captured just like the pauses in songs, full of realized hopes and shattered dreams, with constant reminders of beautiful fragility of life. The road from A to B - be it in time or on two sides of a musical record - is not always in a straight line; it curves around, zigzags madly, loops back, runs into life itself - and is a path connecting the kaleidoscope snapshots of our beings that somehow will eventually fall into the beautiful but ever-changing patterns, which before you know it will fall apart into another snapshot, something different and unrecognizable - because time is a goon, after all.
  “I came for this reason: I want to know what happened between A and B.”
And in the meantime, while the unrelentless goon is mercilessly dragging us along, we can look around at the fragile beauty of life around and try to remember the world for what it is now - because it will never be the same again. Because time is a goon. But for now, it's not yet over. 
  “Sure, everything is ending,” Jules said, “but not yet.”

  And for an instant he would remember Naples: sitting with Sasha in her tiny room; the jolt of surprise and delight he’d felt when the sun finally dropped into the center of her window and was captured inside her circle of wire. Now he turned to her, grinning. Her hair and face were aflame with orange light. “See,” Sasha muttered, eyeing the sun. “It’s mine.”

7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Joel,550,1574,5,"July 18, 2022","""Time is a goon,"" we're told, and the older I get (and I'm not even old), the more I realize that this is really true, as years fly faster and faster and things that once sounded like a long way off are suddenly in the rear view mirror (like: it is 2010; in one year, 9/11 will have been 10 years ago). I used to think 70 seemed old. With my parents newly retired and pushing the seven-decade mark, though, anyone who dies before 80 seems like they died young. I take heart in the fact that, barring a car crash, cancer, or freak tripping-over-the-cat-related catastrophe, I'm still less than halfway done with my brief time on this planet. Is this morbid? Are you supposed to start pondering your mortality a year from 30, or is this some kind of commentary on The Times in Which We Live? Or am I just shifting my fears that I won't end up doing any of the neat things I want to do into the future, the fear that time is only going to keep getting faster, and pretty soon we'll be talking about where we were on that day 20 years ago when Everything Changed, or seemed like it would.This isn't really about the book, but it is. Egan follows a bunch of characters who work in the music industry, ping-ponging from life to life, from the present, to the past, to the future. It makes total sense: time's a goon; it will creep up on you as quickly as turning a page. Nostalgia is a trap too: I don't miss the good old days for what they were, but for what lay ahead of me, the time I've already spent in-between then and now. This book encompasses all of that, allowing us to see it all: the way past regrets and mistakes shape our future choices, the way our lives will unfold and blossom or wither in ways we can't possibly expect, or maybe can exactly predict.Oh, and it's also fabulously written in about a dozen different styles, from first- to second- to third-person and in newspaper articles and even in, yes, PowerPoint graphics. And it's about the music industry which is very cool but also big business and that's an interesting dichotomy, how do you commercialize and corporatize the spirit of punk rock, the primal scream of youth looking around and seeing nothing but waste, looking forward and seeing nothing but uncertainty?",158,55
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Ilse,440,2774,2,"September 22, 2016","Christmas Eve, 2011. The foreboding sheen of a room filled with excited anticipation and beautiful glimmering presents piled up under the Christmas tree. This traditional family habit blending festive elation with infantile sibling jealousy and rivalry ever fuels surreptitious reflections on the guileful art of giving. Every year, I ingenuously and silently wish for a book. (Oh frustration! Do you recognize this experience? Having to live with an avid or obsessive reader, people might think they should actually help the reader, try to re-educate this pathetic creature, curing his book-addiction by rebuffing him his drug, so stop hoping ever getting a book by your family, get real and grow up, Ilse). Then my father selects a cute package looking like a book from the pile and offers it to….my little sister. While she is unwrapping Visit from the goon squad, the dimmed light fortunately conceals my jealous pea-green complexion. A novel about the merciless effects of Time, even labelled as a present-day riposte to Proust, about rock and punk music, experimental, humorous and elegantly written, showered with euphoric reviews in every paper and magazine I read. Sigh. How could my family torture me like this? This just to explain why expectations were damned high and why I was very thrilled when this was scheduled as the next read by my “real life” reading group.Don’t let me be misunderstood. This novel is barely about music - it is partly an unsentimental defiling of popular music culture, exposing the corruption and perverting of the music business world - how capitalism effects and degenerates every level of life, even infecting and hedging in counterculture and rebellious youth just for profit. It’s the economy, stupid.The start is promising. The structure surely looks clever – the welding together of the different viewpoints taken in the non-chronological 13 chapters – short stories in their own right - entangling the stories by a playful use of characters more or less subtly turning up in each other’s stories; in the beginning it almost reminded me of the narrative techniques used in the wonderful film Short Cuts. In an interview Egan frantically emphasized this is not  merely a collection of short stories, defending its coherence and connectedness, although in the embryo stage there were just a couple of short stories. She compares her novel to a concept album. And there is where the novel misses a mark. Observing a skeleton, few laud the beauty of the bone structure. The novel bears a resemblance to an edifice of which someone forgot to remove the scaffolding. The structure is so obtrusively visible that it obscures the substance (in that respect, Egan��s distracting accent on structure reminded me of another much-admired novel which also left me underwhelmed and which, like Egan’s, also references to Proust, Bonsaï by Zambra). Attempting to pinpoint why I lost my interest in the characters and where a sense of disenchantment slipped in, I discern 2 entirely personal flaws triggering this. First, punk and rock music are Radio Nostalgia to me, and as the flavor of the wild years is still with me, Egan’s prose suffers from a phoniness that cannot be saved by just namedropping one my favorite bands, the Dead Kennedys, or describing slam dancing. Where is the raw power, the energy in sex, drugs and rock-and-roll? Except for the occasional half smile it provoked, her prose is too slick and polished for me to call it sardonic (ever read Flaubert’s letters?). I am aware probably it is just me. I must have turned into some grumpy curmudgeon overnight without noticing, which could clarify another cause why the book eventually did not resonate with me. Reading about the various (mainly trivial) vicissitudes of the aging, over-the-hill rockers and their state of decay, I soon found myself humming snippets of a old Rolling Stones song, thinking about the successive generations at work alternately hitting the dance floor at the new year party when “their” music is played and staring at each other the rest of the time:You're obsolete my baby My poor old-fashioned baby I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time. However entertaining by flashes, it definitely wasn’t a wise idea – and perhaps not fair to Egan - to pick this immediately after reading a masterpiece of world literature, I'm Not Stiller, by Max Frisch. As to aesthetical and artistic taste, I clearly seem to have become a fogey.Time as a bunch of ruthless thugs ever willing and able to beat you up and crush you is a lucky strike as a leitmotiv, but couldn’t prop up the whole novel. Neither could a flake of gold in your coffee. Panta Rei, as Heraclitus said. Memento Mori. Yeah, the Grim Reaper will come and get you sooner or later and everything is ending, but not yet. I think we all know. The British band Crass declared punk dead in 1978 in just a few lines which said it all:Yes that's right, punk is dead,It's just another cheap product for the consumers head.Bubblegum rock on plastic transistors,Schoolboy sedition backed by big time promoters.CBS promote the Clash,But it ain't for revolution, it's just for cash.Punk became a fashion just like hippy used to beAnd it ain't got a thing to do with you or me.Talking about music and the spirit of the age, a pitch-perfect rock song could outdo Egan’s exposé. I still believe in the power of music. There is more authentic despair in this single song of Eels than in the whole idea of Time as a goon squad knocking at your door:Rags To RagsThere's a spider crawling on the bathroom mirrorRight on top of my right eyeAnd I can't stop staring backHow did I get this way?Take a big look at a living lie Rags to rags and rust to rustHow do you stand when you've been crushed?So rags to riches was a bust Sometimes I dream about itWhat it's like back homeThe railroad tracks and the pussy willowBut I had to leave itNow I go back Whenever my tired head hits the pillowRags to rags and rust to rustHow do you stand when you've been crushed?So rags to riches was a bust Busted once againWell I'll show them one dayThat I can buy and sell the world And one day I'll come through my american dreamBut it won't mean a fucking thing Rags to rags and rust to rustHow do you stand when you've been crushed?So rags to rags and rust to rustDon't let me go.Should ask my sister if she read it anyway, meanwhile. Parenthetically, the kitchenware I got from my parents as a change that year (instead of “another” book), was fine for me, thank you. I love cooking and organizing parties. ",148,64
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Kemper,"1,388",6647,3,"August 26, 2016","Reading this book is like going into the future and eavesdropping on a conversation between two old friends who haven’t seen each other in years:“Remember Bennie Salazar?”“Sure. He was that record producer who used to put the gold flakes in his coffee. Didn’t he used to be in a band?”“Yeah, he was a wannabe punk rocker in the ‘80s. He was friends with Scotty back then.”“Was Scotty normal then? Because I heard he’s completely shithouse-rat-crazy these days.”“Oh, he’s totally insane. Hey, what was Bennie’s assistant’s name?”“Sasha?”“That’s it. Whatever happened to her?”“I’m not sure. I heard she was a total kleptomaniac.” “Really? I heard some wild stories about her running around Europe back in the day.”“Someone told me that a friend of hers drowned and really messed her up.”“Huh. It had to be something. Oh, did you know Bennie’s ex-wife used to work for that PR woman Dolly?”“The one who is trying to resurrect her business by helping that dictator rehab his image?”“That’s her. Like she’ll ever get steady work again after that disaster she put together.”“Wasn’t it Bennie’s ex-wife’s brother who attacked that actress that’s been hanging around that dictator, too?”“That’s right! Small freaking world.”See what I mean? You don’t really know these people, but after a while, you get to know their stories and get a feeling for the connections between them. That’s what Jennifer Egan has done in this creative little novel. By telling a series of stories loosely based around Bennie and Sasha’s past, present and future, she builds a web of relationships that becomes large but always feels intimate.One of her cuter tricks is an entire section told via a PowerPoint presentation written by a child in the future. It sounds like a gimmick that might be good for a few laughs, but Egan actually uses it to give us a pretty detailed portrait of the future family of one of the characters we’ve read about earlier in the book.It’s a well-written and clever book, but the tone’s a bit sad and depressing because it deals a lot with the loss and regrets that all adults have over what gets left behind as you move through life. I might have liked it more if I hadn’t just read Super Sad True Love Story, which also dealt a lot with the down side of aging. The two books also share a similarity in depicting a future state where smart phones and constant communication have changed society. (This one is mostly set in the past and present with only a couple of sections in the futue.) So while I liked this, I got a bit of a been-there/done that flavor when reading it, and I think I hit depression overload somewhere in the middle of this.",142,19
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Fabian,933,1525,4,"July 14, 2020","Taking home the Pulitzer, it's clear to me what type of novels are favored: the novels deemed fresh and classic simultaneously. Like ""Olive Kitteridge"" or ""The Interpreter of Maladies"", this is a novel made up of short stories, all of them vivid anecdotes of people surrounding the music industry (as in musicians, roadies, fans, relatives... etc.) in precise clear-cut slivers of everyday life. Jennifer Egan's prose is exciting, her method of bleeding one story onto the next, of building up these, what Mario Vargas Llosa so eloquently calls, ""communicating vessels,"" is a true feat. There is an avalanche effect of moods and tones, which is why the last story, perhaps not the best in the bunch, carries with it the hefty stigma of all those that came before it. I also really enjoyed a whole chapter displayed in Power Point format. The span of years seems negligible, for the feeling of youth & life is expertly crystallized. Enjoyable, a bit chaotic, & certainly not tame. (I mean, even the theme of rock and roll exuberance is interesting in itself.) A sprinkle of Bret Easton Ellis (I mean, the good kind) alongside other ""voices of the Zeitgeist""... & you have a very clever, winning book.",141,7
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Aldrin,56,254,5,"September 1, 2017","There are two paragraphs in Jennifer Egan’s new book, 
  A Visit from the Goon Squad
, that heavily hint on its fundamental theme but were not at all written by the author. One is the book’s epigraph, taken from Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time: “Poets claim that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. It is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find those fixed places, contemporaneous with different years.” The other is a note at the back of the book regarding the typeface used, supposedly written by the book’s typesetter: “The text of this book was set in Electra, [a face that] cannot be classified as either modern or old style. It is not based on any historical model, nor does it echo any particular period or style. It [...] attempts to give a feeling of fluidity and power.” These two extraneous blocks of words could not be more apt in drawing attention to the single intrinsic element of the novel contained between them that, already, unrelentingly makes its authority over the characters known to the reader page after mesmerizing page. That element is none other than time, the cruel visitor of the title as referred to in an aphorism half remembered (or perhaps wholly invented) by a character in the twilight of his life and career. “Time’s a goon, right? Isn’t that the expression?” he asks. “I’ve never heard that,” another troubled character answers. “Would you disagree?” “No.” In Goon Squad, time is also a prankster complicit in an elaborate trick masterminded by the book’s author herself, who goes as far as naming one of her characters after the personification of time in Greek mythology, Chronos. Egan's novel is certainly not of the time travel science fiction sort, but its clever use of a nonlinear timeline of all-too-real events is evocative of one that is. Kurt Vonnegut's 
  Slaughterhouse Five
 quickly comes to mind. Like poor Billy Pilgrim in Vonnegut's novel, the characters in Goon Squad are also, in a manner of speaking, “unstuck in time.” However, given that Goon Squad is decidedly non-science-fictional, they are not by nature predisposed to travel through time and randomly jump from one event in their lives to another as Billy Pilgrim insists he is. It’s Egan who does the unsticking. Although her abrupt transitions to different events, one of which happens in 1973 while another takes place in the 2020s, occasionally generate obvious and disruptive seams in the narrative, she still effectively and eloquently tells her characters’ mostly tragic stories out of sequence and convention and generously gives paragraph-long glimpses of their past and future selves. The novel swoops back and forth through time as it focuses on certain events in the lives of a bevy of major and minor characters created by Egan. But lest a potential reader be turned off by this unconventional chronology which some may interpret as nothing more than another unessential postmodern gimmick that requires more effort than usual, it should be noted that Egan is both considerate and smart enough to drop one or two temporal clues within each chapter of her novel, so that when, say, the central character of one chapter is said to lie about her age in her online profiles, one learns almost instantly that that chapter is set around the time of Facebook and so-called social media, i.e., the present. Most of these clues are easy enough to decipher in a jiffy, while others are less straightforward, requiring a bit of mental arithmetic and recognition of allusions to characters and occurrences in earlier and even later chapters/years. Among the story’s long dramatis personae, a few characters stand out and appear in two or more chapters although each is made the focus of only one. There’s Sasha, introduced in the very first chapter as nothing short of a mess: in a session with her therapist in New York City, she relates how she, while on a casual date, succumbed to another episode of kleptomania and stole a wallet in a restaurant bathroom. There’s Sasha’s boss, Bennie Salazar, divorced and all but estranged from his son, impotent and inclined to look at her assistant’s breast as some sort of a barometer for his erectile dysfunction. There’s Bennie’s brother-in-law, Jules Jones, a struggling writer imprisoned for attempting to rape a Hollywood starlet. They are but three of the twenty- or thirty-odd interconnected characters that inhabit the novel, which for all one knows is actually a short story collection that happens to employ a number of recurring characters. But to dismiss Goon Squad as merely a squad of short stories is to strip it of its underlying theme of redemption and reconnection. True, many of the chapters here would be right at home in the pages of The New Yorker and other high-end literary publications. Also, one is free to read the stories in no particular order, similar to putting a digital album or playlist on shuffle, perhaps cracking the book open in the middle and proceeding to read another story a couple of chapters away from the previous one, thus compounding the obliqueness of the novel’s storyline. But so long as the book is completely traversed, its grip should be easily felt and its message appreciated.It’s no wonder then that the book’s format resembles that of a record album. Its chapters are divided into parts A and B, clearly inspired by the A and B sides of vinyl records and audio cassettes, the analog music storage media of yore. Indeed, music, like time, plays a major role in Goon Squad. Here it serves as a sort of sanctuary to the characters. Often, it affords them, beyond the desultory trips down memory lane, a strong sense of being. Sasha writes on her list of realistic goals, “Find a band to manage” and “Practice the harp,” sandwiching “Understand the news” and “Study Japanese.” Bennie, who is in fact a record producer, is transported back to when he and his high school friends were carefree sixteen-year-olds after listening to a couple of his old favorite bands in his car. Jules gets a new lease in life and gets to cover a musician’s last tour.Whereas time is a goon, here (and presumably elsewhere) music is an ally, even as the latter is nothing if not for the former. Don’t records, cassettes, and CDs normally play clockwise as though to indicate the passage of time? Doesn’t the timestamp on a digital music player continue to increment even when there’s a considerably long pause in the currently playing track? And when one is made to think of a certain period, isn’t the kind of music that thrived during that period among the first things that come to one’s mind? Conversely, when one listens to an old favorite song, doesn’t one immediately think of the important events in one’s life that occurred around the time that song was released? Goon Squad doesn’t necessarily pose these seemingly trifling questions. Rather, what it does, after telling the stories of Sasha, Bennie, Jules, and the other musically inclined characters through a polyphonic pastiche of styles that include first-person narration, journalistic reportage, and most notably PowerPoint (yes, PowerPoint), is to make one ask oneself an important question so that one may be encouraged to take stock of one's life so far and maintain or regain one’s purchase on it. This question echoes a line from a famous Radiohead song: ""What the hell am I doing here?""",125,10
7331435,A Visit from the Goon Squad,Joe Valdez,470,762,1,"September 3, 2017","This novel snaked through my filters--put in place to keep me from wasting time reading books I'll likely abandon and pin with one-star reviews I really don't like to give--due to the following:1. Unanimously positive critical reviews2. Promise of electrifying writing or storytelling (see #1)3. Fantastic title4. Author, whose work I've never read, endorsed a petition in May 2016 in protest of the current president along with 450 other authorsThe positive vibe didn't last long. A Visit From the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan begins with a New Yorker bored enough with her work as an executive assistant to a record company mogul to get her kicks as a kleptomaniac. She's bored on her date with a colleague. They go back to her place and have boring sex; off page (boring!). They never see each other again--too bored. The klepto's psychiatrist is bored by her problems. The mogul is bored by life and spikes his coffee with gold (metal) flakes. He visits with an all-sisters rock band in the suburbs that has gone nowhere in five years, but he's bored by them. He makes a pass at his assistant, but she's too bored by him for her to respond.I don't know, maybe it's just me, but the reaction I had trying to turn 38 pages of this novel was ... boredom. At the beginning of any book, fiction or non-fiction, adult literature or children's book, I'm primed for anything. The author has my permission to book me an all-expenses paid trip to anyplace in their imagination. Egan sent me to New York with some of the dullest upwardly mobile do-nothing think-nothing taking up dead space adults I've ever met in a novel. I know plenty more of this type of novel are out there, but I usually avoid reading them.I don't enjoy reading about successful urbanites and their problems. Many readers do, but this isn't for me. I felt like the glimmer of life support in the early going here was the all-sisters rock band struggling to get anywhere, but Egan isn't writing about a girl rock band. She's writing about the miserably bored adults surrounding rock bands. Before I turned into one of them myself, I abandoned the book, probably my least favorite of those that have garnered near universal acclaim since Annihilation",122,36

Normally, I have no problem with that. I love arrogant people when the arrogance is earned. But these stories didn’t ring true for me. They felt staged and cute and show-offy. “Oh, look what I can do. I can write a chapter in the second person for no reason and another one in PowerPoint and another one in cyber-gibberish. And I can connect a bunch of simplistic but oh-so-quirky characters together and have them do unbelievable things because I created this faux world with the power of my mind (and caffeine) and you will love it because it includes every issue and theme that has ever existed in the history of the world while also being about nothing, which is to say, the beauty and tragedy of life but much more of the tragedy because that’s what wins awards.”This book mostly merits a shrug.

Also like Joyce, Egan has structured her work into a series of loosely connected short stories, though Egan’s novel, or collection of short work, is more narratively connected than the earlier work. Likewise, Egan’s novel features a cast of dozens of characters who collectively add depth and personality to an already entertaining presentation.53rd & 3rdThis was a virtuoso performance. This was like Ali vs. Liston, a devilishly simple looking knockout. This was Jimi at Monterey, flipping it upside down, reversing the strings and playing it left handed. This was badass.Egan uses the vibrant, feral power of punk rock to add spice and contextual verve to her design. The entire book is connected to media and entertainment, whereby Egan demonstrates the omnipresent effect of our information age connectivity.Been Caught StealingOne of the main characters, recurring in more than one chapter or vignette, struggles with anti-social behavior including kleptomania. While several characters deal with and strive against behavior disorders of various complexity, this inclusion is important for Egan’s worldview which examines with a critical eye our global culture’s fixation with the materialistic and publicity mindedness.My GenerationThe title comes from the idea of time as a goon, a hired muscle who comes to inflict pain. So a visit from the good squad is to get beat up by time, an appointment we all have coming sooner or later.While Egan is sensitive to and observant of different generational identities, her central examination is of how the overlapping generations of our multi-cultural, pluralistic society works together in a dynamic group identity.Egan’s loosely connected narrative structure is reminiscent of David Mitchell, with it’s layered together detail. The fragile family ties with the ever present specter of self destruction and mortality casting a shadow over all, along some very slick and inventive stream of consciousness sections (one chapter was presented as a power point slideshow) is evocative of an updated and rebooted The Sound and the Fury. Celluloid HeroesMuch of the book revolves around the recording industry but there is also mention of Hollywood, literature and publicity. Entertainment. Egan shows how our Western culture has invaded, infected and absorbed much the rest of the world. Not altogether critical, Egan does show how media, especially music, can be a defining and unifying vehicle; but the more memorable observation is for the superficial and divisive nature of celebrity.It’s a Small World After AllFinally, A Visit from the Goon Squad, calling on a scene from a realizable and recognizable near future, demonstrates how transportation and media has, for good and bad, made the world’s borders shrink and contract. The connectedness of the book’s many characters and the bringing together of a multiplicity of cultures, times and places shows there may be hope for us after all.",102,8

It wasn't a light read, even though it's fairly short. It had a unique format that works equally well as both a collection of short stories and a novel.
