35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Scott,"1,674",119,4,"May 20, 2018","Turner's latest revised edition - it's frequently been updated and re-titled over the last 20+ years - covering every song written by the Fab Four. (Their early covers, such as 'Roll Over Beethoven' or 'Act Naturally,' are not included in the rundown.) Full lyrics are listed, along with whatever background information is definitively known about a song's inspiration and/or other factoids.There are also a lot of great photographs, nicely sidestepping familiar pics that are often used elsewhere.I've said it in other Beatle-related reviews, but again I'm amazed at the prodigious output (in less than ten years time!) prior to the age of 30 - but then again, it is called show business for a reason.",13,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Jonathan,505,30,5,"March 13, 2022","This was a perfect book for the coffee table. I would pick it up, read a few fascinating tidbits about some Beatles songs, and put it down to read again later. Virtually every bit about a song brought something new and interesting. It was especially cool to read about the songs from Let It Be, as I have watched the first episode of the new Beatles film about the making of that album. So I got to see it from both sides.As with all the Beatles books I have been reading, I am constantly amazed at how little control they had over their own music and how it was package. Even the best rock group of all time (don't @ me) had an astonishing lack of creative control. Constant complaints about reworkings of their songs, packaging of the albums and how it got marketed. At the height of their powers, one guy would say ""Oh, this song needs more strings"", hand it off to Phil Spector of all people, to ""improve"" on their sound. And they wouldn't know about it until the record actually came out! Crazy!But there were some great insights into the creative process, with plenty of research on John and Paul. And he gave plenty of credit to George Harrison, who got the short shift his entire time with the Beatles.This book was so much fun. He wasn't afraid to cast a few critical aspersions at some of the songs, esp. ones included at the end on the Anthology albums, saying there were certainly reasons for these songs to be left off the albums. Definitely worth it for any Beatles fans!",6,2
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Bridge,4,2,5,"August 31, 2007","This is one of my favorite books ever. You can flip to any page and get a completely entertaining story ranging in length from a few paragraphs to one page front and back. Lots of great photos I had never seen before, the Beatles and practically every single famous person from the 1960s. An essential handbook for any beatles fan. ",6,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,William,46,5,5,"January 9, 2012","What a fun read for the Beatles fan. Arranged by album - from those bygone days when we not only purchased our music by the album, but tended to listen and review them as a whole. There are a few gems, as when the details of John or Paul's contributions are explained. But the other delight is the wreckage it makes of high faluting interpretations of individual songs that pop critics and stoners have made of their songs. The lads were crafting 2-3 minute gems, with an eye, or ear, for melody and harmony, a willingness to submit to the authority of rhyme and meter, and gifted with a talent beyond their own - and our - reckoning. Great color from the days of their most prolific periods, with photos to augment the nostalgia. Also recommended for the excellent and humble introduction where the author cites many other books on the Beatles that I was unaware of.I give book four out of four ""Yeah's"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH!)",4,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Hugh,89,1 follower,4,"June 13, 2022",This book is exactly what it says it is. Four stars simply because it wasn't a page turner. You have to chip away at it in pieces. Maybe I would feel differently if I knew even more of their songs.,3,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Bruce,438,72,3,"January 24, 2014","I'm posting this for its relevance to my present reading of Ian MacDonald's Revolution in the Head and anticipated reading of John Blaney's Together Alone, all of which was triggered by the recent releases of McCartney's exquisite ""Memory Almost Full"" (despite its dreadful lead track) and the George Martin Beatles revisitation ""Love.""A Hard Days' Write makes a fitting companion for Mark Hertsgaard's A Day in the Life and Alan W. Pollack's extensive song-by-song musical analyses at http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/D.... It considers the source material for the Beatles' ouerve, track by track by track. As such, it is occasionally revealing (and apparently well-researched), but fairly lightweight inasmuch as the focus is on the Beatles' lyrics -- which for the most part cannot stand alone -- and not their music-making, which was exquisite. Had I not read this simultaneously with the Hertsgaard, I probably would not have bothered. The Alan W. Pollack notes (which ignore the lyrics to focus on the music and follow the MacDonald, which I'm using to fill in the gaps) are much more highly recommended.",2,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Joe,129,9,4,"April 2, 2016","Fun short info on each song from each album, no earth shattering insights. I am using this as a resource for a speech on the Beatles I am giving for Toastmasters.",2,2
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Caleb,76,2,3,"August 11, 2019","I feel really weird rating a book about The Beatles with only three stars. But then again, I'm a huge fan and have been for as long as I can remember, so this book was far less enlightening than I had hoped when I bought it on a whim while on holiday this past spring. I think the problem is just that I already knew something like 80% of the stories related in this book. It just didn't dawn on me until I made my way through this. I'd read it and think, ""Yeah, you got that one right too."" There just weren't that many times where I would be impressed by some new detail about a song or the group themselves.So I suppose the takeaway for me is that this isn't a bad book. But if you already fancy yourself a big fan of the group, think about how much you know about the songs already before you pay good money for a book like this. Odds are it's going to be a waste of time and money in the end. There aren't even enough interesting photos in here to justify buying it for that reason, so don't justify it with that logic either. This is a book that is better suited to the new fan that hasn't already heard these stories a dozen times before.Oh, and while it's not a ton of them, I will say some of the stories do end up being a bit adult in nature too, so I would be mindful of letting kids near this one, if you have a youngster who's a big fan like I was so many years ago. You might be explaining some things you don't want to explain just yet.",1 like,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Rob Paczkowski,163,2,5,"January 5, 2020","It took me a long time to get started as I am not a huge Beatles fan and only knew their most popular music. Technology caught up and I was able to open YouTube, pull up the albums ( the book goes in order until the end with rarities) and I was able to quickly click on a song to listen to it while reading the information on the song. Wow, a fun trip on an amazing group. It seems like some of the information is speculation based on sometimes conflicting information ( even the same Beatle conflicting themselves) but realizing that the vast majority of the music was in a 7+ year window is mind blowing. Think of your last 7 years. What have you accomplished ( my son said this to me as I was sharing info with him. ). Makes the potential for some misinformation tolerable as it’s surprising that anyone remembers anything at all. Not just for Beatles fans but anyone that enjoys music, the writing process and music history.",1 like,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Ryan,178,10,2,"December 1, 2021","The author doesn’t hesitate to offer his own opinionated views on songs. He also loves offering tangents that don’t provide any insight to The Beatles’ songwriting. These are very apparent on songs where the author doesn’t have anything specific to say, which kind of ruins the entire point of the book. And all those tangents and opinions act as nothing but filler, which seems even more bizarre when historical context is either missing or misplaced elsewhere. On the whole, this was a very surface-level book that doesn’t offer anything new. ",1 like,N/A

The Beatles have always been beloved to me, but this book made me certain that they are my favorite band and an absolute force of genius the world will never experience again.",1 like,N/A

35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Danielle,73,2,5,"February 19, 2017",I'm a super hardcore Beatles fan and thoroughly enjoyed learning about the origin behind every wonderful Beatles song. I learned a lot about the Beatles as song writers and their character because of this fun and very informative book. I listened to each Beatles song as I read about it which was a very enriching and satisfying experience. Steve Turner did a great job.,1 like,N/A
35666,A Hard Days Write The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,Garrett Cash,653,1 follower,5,"June 14, 2016","Great rock writer Steve Turner does an incredible job of compiling all sorts of information to bring together the most comprehensive work possible on how Beatles' songs got written. Even for a long time (and encyclopedic) fan such as myself, there's all sorts of information that will surely be new to you, and lots of pictures you've probably never seen. The book illuminates not only how varied the sources of the Beatles songs were but also how each member had their own avenues of thinking that they would return to (Paul's optimism, John's isolationism). In a landscape of many Beatles books this stands out as one of the most important, since it is a place to find reliable accounts of the varying stories of how the songs came to be. And what is truly more important than the songs? The songs are why we fell in love with The Beatles and what brings us back over and over again, so this book is important as a definitive work on arguably the most important element of the Beatles. There are plenty of books out there that examine the music of the songs, and this one probably can't be topped for exploring the lyrics. ",1 like,N/A
