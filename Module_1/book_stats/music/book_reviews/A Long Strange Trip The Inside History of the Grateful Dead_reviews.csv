7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Lee Klein ,785,830,5,"May 15, 2020","The greatest epic I've read since War and Peace. Sort of joking about that but only sort of. A fantastic picaresque adventure featuring a cast of charismatic characters, supremely talented and obsessive yet somehow not very ambitious, dedicated to music/magic and drugs, surrounded by all sorts of supporting acts, from other bands and musicians to their manly, ribald crew and crazy, coke-fueled managers, to all the women they leave in their wake thanks to their ""emotional cowardice,"" a phrase the author repeatedly uses toward the end to criticize Jerry, the non-leading leader of the band at the core of this. Not at all unwilling to call the boys out on their bullshit, including crap records and shows -- but also written by someone who worked for the band as their publicist for years and definitely understood every aspect of their ethos and relays it perfectly, for the most part -- I only felt things were very occasionally slightly discolored by the author's (I wanted to write ""narrator's,"" as though the book were written by a figment of the band's collective consciousness) choice to refer to himself in the third-person as ""Scrib"" instead of simply opting for the less intrusive ""I,"" and sometimes his conservative deployment of full-throttle lyrical description of the music didn't match my understanding of the songs or the playing, especially in terms of chords and notes et cetera (I won't go back through to search for examples -- just that sometimes I felt like the flights of ecstatic descriptive fancy were technically a little off). But the overall structure seemed perfect: imagine all the other ways all this info and all these anecdotes could've been presented. There must have been a temptation to present a loose improvisational structure, form matching content, form matching the formlessness of the band's best moments. But instead, for something so voluminous, containing such multitudes, it's linear, with regularly shaped and consistently sized chapters that felt like they're each about 25 pages, interspersed with interludes detailing an abstracted representative late-'80s/early-'90s stadium show (not a particular date), including most interestingly all the gear, cords, wires, lights, on and on, through the intermission and encore and post-show escape in a van to the airport to the next city's hotel by the time most fans have finally recovered enough to hit the road home. So many great bits like Bob Weir and some unknown black guitarist at the Guild tent at the Monterrey Pop Festival, having fun making semi-hollowbody guitars feedback, playing a little duet of howls -- and of course the unknown black guitarist turns out to be Jimi Hendrix. Or how Jimi was once backstage with his guitar all set to sit in but Mickey Hart, too deep into things on a certain psychedelic, forgot to give him the signal to come on stage and so he took off. The best bits were about how the songs came together, how Jerry's old bluegrass/folk friend from Palo Alto came back around with lyric sheets that saved them from having sub-mediocre psych lyrics like in ""Cream Puff War"" and really made the band what it is, as much as the long jams built on what Lesh called ""bleshing,"" all five or six or seven players playing like the fingers on a hand, all unified. But of course there's constant infighting, cliques, power struggles, a psychedelic game of Survivor played over the course of a few decades. The progression is definitely not linear -- they rise and fall (rise and fall) throughout, all of it leading to the MTV hit in '87 that makes it impossible for them to play anywhere other than massive stadiums, lawless scenes that attract tens of thousands of ticketless revelers. I particularly got a little jolt when shows I attended were mentioned, like the show at the crumbling JFK Stadium in Philly (7/7/89) or the show in Cleveland in '93 I had a ticket for that was canceled thanks to a blizzard (the band spent most of the day at a nearby movie theater). And of course there's everything about Jerry's physical dissolution that started when he started smoking heroin during the '77 spring tour -- found it very odd that the significance of that tour wasn't really covered and realized that its absence probably gave Peter Conners the idea to write the excellent Cornell '77: The Music, the Myth, and the Magnificence of the Grateful Dead's Concert at Barton Hall, which I read before this and loved, which ultimately is why I decided to read this, because I wanted to delve deeper into all this, a nostalgic trip for the soundtrack and experiences of my mid-to-late teenage years I'm more than happy to revisit and appreciate these days again from a completely different perspective, on the other side of so much other music listened to and loved and so many other bands seen live -- to quote promoter Bill Graham: they're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones who do what they do. Highest recommendation to anyone who watched the documentary of the same name available now for streaming on Amazon and thought that a four-hour documentary felt kind of thin. I'll soon read the Garcia bio and then maybe read some more long-form non-fiction, which feels good these days.",15,7
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Jerry Oliver,98,3,5,"September 10, 2014","Wow. What a long strange read it's been. This was the epic rock and roll band biography. I have to give it five stars because it inspired me to dig deeper into the Dead and the individual members music more than ever and as a result of that growing in my own understanding of music. If there is anything you learn about the Dead in this book is that it is all about the music. Really man, no matter how much psychedelics, fame, women, personal drama, hangers on and more came through there lives when they hit the stage the music always had the potential for magic. ",5,N/A
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Michael Lawrence,64,5,5,"July 10, 2008","Instead of writing a review I will just cut and paste something I had written about my experience with the Grateful Dead. It's sums up the reason I bought this book in the first place.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<After my first Grateful Dead show at the Philadelphia Spectrum I was hooked and addicted to the people and scene surrounding the band and it's concerts.It was like no place I have ever known. Certainly not like any concert I have ever been to or even like any people I have ever met.The communal atmosphere was the most intriguing. I was a teenager yet was never judged and was treated like an adult and an equal always. Not common in my time to be treated anything other than a punk teenager. Mostly because I was a punk teenager! :)  Everyone got along. Everybody danced. Everybody sung loud. Everyone was happy. Everyone was kind. Everyone was generous, even if they had very little. This all was a complete 180 degrees from what I was used to. It was awesome.And the music! Finally, I found people that shared my sick addiction to music. A small group of me and my friends were music fanatics but we were only a handful. Now I am surrounded by a whole tribe of people who had the same insatiable appetite for not only music but for live music and being there at live music. The stadiums and arenas.. being in the same space that the music was happening. That was something very profound to me as a youth. The energy from the band, energy from the other fans. All combined into one giant ball of positive energy that you can truly feel. It's indescribable actually and one of my favorite feelings I have ever felt. The Grateful Dead was all of this rolled into one vibe. And that vibe spilled into every aspect of my life from that moment on. It was grand.After Jerry died I was like many other's in search of a similar vibe to surround a band, a tour, a culture of fans. It was then that I went to see my first PHISH show. I'll never forget it. PHISH, to this very day have been my favorite band. I have seen them in concert over 30 times and am still waiting for that reunion to happen. (It will, soon)My favorite band, seeing them from the Mexico border to their final show in Coventry Vermont. The way I was changed my life perspective and general personality... All of it began was with my very first Grateful Dead show. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>So I decided to get this book to learn a better history of this amazing band that exposed me to this new way of living and thinking and being. The Dead was not my favorite band. Not even top ten actually. But they were the one band that launched this change of direction in me and my life. Ok having said that, this book is an amazing account of the dead from its roots to Jerry's death. It is very well written, funny and entertaining all the way through. McNally is close enough to the band to really write an honest account. If you're a dead head you gotta read this book. Its got it all. From beginning to end. I'd even recommend it to anyone that is into the psychedelic era, the 60's in general of just the history of a band that was a cultural phenomenon that will have it's mark on American music forever.",3,1 comment
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,David,227,29,4,"April 21, 2017","Widely considered to be the ultimate compendium for Grateful Dead history, Dennis McNally’s A Long Strange Trip: The Inside History of the Grateful Dead is an extremely dense book. It has taken me a long time to finish it, but it was extremely well-written and contained a lot of information that I did not know prior to picking it up.The book follows the Grateful Dead from their 1965 gig at Magoo’s Pizza in Menlo Park, CA to Jerry Garcia’s death in 1995. McNally was the official band historian beginning in 1980. There’s a lot to be found in this book, from musical trivia and lyrics, feuds between the band members and crew, a sense of what being a Dead Head is all about, etc. It is essentially an encyclopedia for the Dead.The book is presented mostly in chapter format, with an occasional “Interlude” thrown in. These Interludes do a good job of breaking up the flow of time for the reader, making it easy to read such a long book. I wish it hadn’t taken me so long to read, but at times it felt like information overload - I mean, I love the Dead but I don’t need to know absolutely everything! But the good side of this is that if you want to know anything about the Dead, you can probably find it inside.Published in 2003, the book doesn’t have any information on The Dead’s reunification in 2009 (which I was fortunate to witness firsthand) or the musical developments of Phil Lesh and Friends, RatDog and The Other Ones in the mid-200s. But that’s to be expected, and considering this book is about the Grateful Dead, and not the side projects that happened after Garcia passed, there really isn’t anything missing.4/5 Stars. 684 pages. Published 2003.",3,N/A

7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Justin Hampton,10,4,2,"March 3, 2013","Whew. This was a long, rambling, occasionally enlightening but ultimately shambolic and overlong tome on one of the '60s counterculture's most enduring institutions. In this way, it's not unlike the band at its most aimless and self-indulgent. Granted, there's a lot of ground here to cover, from the band's freewheeling early days to the many financial missteps to the band's obsession with sound and fidelity to a full-on cultural phenomenon which garnered the regard of much straighter business entrepreneurs. But it unfortunately doesn't focus on any of these very well. In particular, it really misses an opportunity to craft a truly moving narrative around the book's most intriguing character, Jerry Garcia. Far from being the wise, bearded father figure of the freak nation, Garcia emerges from the brief biographical sketches as a deeply troubled victim of the Dead's success, silently slaughtered over the decades by the demands of countless hangers-on and audience members, resented by bandmates and categorically denied of any solace or chance to heal through love or music, each of which betrays him over time. It is utterly heartbreaking to acknowledge that the scion of a huge underground family should die alone in his sleep in a detox center after a lifetime of horrendous choices caught up with him. A more skilled biographer, or perhaps one not so intimately linked to the Dead (McNally served as their publicist.), could have crafted this into a very powerful, if difficult, object lesson for an entire community. As it stands, there's plenty of unique tidbits in here that make it important for anyone trying to understand why the Dead meant so much for so long to their audience, but hard to wade through if you're not a Deadhead.",2,N/A
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Tim,492,21,5,"November 15, 2018","This trip makes for a great read, and it is a must read for anyone who has ever been a fan of the Grateful Dead. I was enjoying it so much, I skimmed through it a second time after finishing it. You don't have to be a Deadhead to get something good from this. McNally was a member of the Dead's inner circle (nicknamed ""Scrib"" for his writing), their longtime communications director, so he knows plenty about the band. ""A Long Strange Trip"" tells the whole story, beginning with Jerry Garcia's youth up to the band's dissolution not long after Jerry's tragic death. I won't attempt a recap here, because so much happens - a lot of it is amusing, but there are plenty of serious moments as well. The book moves along at a good clip and covers all the bases in the Dead's world, touching on the music, the personalities, the ups and downs, the conflicts, the changes, the romances, the politics, the relationship between the band and its fans, et cetera. The author views his subject with loving but clear eyes; he knew very well that the band had its dark sides, e.g. drug and alcohol abuse was a major problem. This is a classic rock read (and it is a crowded field.) If you have ever been curious about the GD and the stories behind this band's unique presence in American cultural life, you will surely enjoy this.",2,N/A
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Hoagie,15,1 follower,4,"February 7, 2013","I didn't follow the Grateful Dead around the country and I only saw one live show. I'm a big fan of the Dead, however. I owned all of their recordings on vinyl at one point or another. I have enjoyed the improvisational freedom of their music since hearing it for the first time in 1967. Their influences (Jugband, Classic Rock, Jazz, Blues, Country and Bluegrass) have provided the starting point for many of my investigations into the various facets of American music. This book traces the Dead's history from the very beginning through Jerry Garcia's early demise. There are also individual biographical sketches of each band member from childhood. Although I enjoyed the book immensely, there is a lot of focus on personal and family aspects of the Dead that a lot of people who aren't ardent fans might not enjoy quite so much.",2,N/A
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Nora,23,6,1,"April 27, 2011","I picked this 600-odd page up off my friend's bookshelf, and not being a Deadhead, still told myself I'd read up into the point where the Dead became famous, and then I'd stop. (I like reading cultural/subcultural histories, and I was more interested in learning the band's backstory than reading about their days as a cultural phenomenon.) I got farther than that, to around page 250, and then I just had to put it down. Basically all 600 pages might have well have read, ""the Grateful Dead shit gold"". Really; the author was that sycophantic. There must be a more interesting, objective, varied history on the Dead out there. But I don't think I'm interested enough to seek one out.",2,N/A
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Gabriel Clarke,423,20,4,"July 16, 2016","Mostly, I've been re-reading this whilst listening to a lot of Dead shows in roughly chronological order (73-74 and 77, finishing returns IMHO thereafter). It's a compelling, tragic story that covers the last decade of the Dead in about a tenth of the space the first decade gets. But perhaps that's entirely proportionate. McNally was deeply embedded in the band's infrastructure as both historian and publicist for about 15 years but his perspective is unflinchingly warts and all. Garcia's daughter, Annabelle, sums up a great deal with her remark at his funeral - ""Jerry was a great man and a shitty father."" ",2,N/A
7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Chelsea Lawson,284,28,4,"October 18, 2012","It felt a bit like reading someone's diary and I found the writing to be rudimentary at times so I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't meant to be a novel. And when McNally tried too hard to sound literary that was almost worse than when he just gave the story plain and simple. As an 'inside history,' it does what it promises and you're so sad to see Jerry go at the end. ",2,1 comment

Even if you're not a deadhead, and not necessarily into jamband music, I'd still recommend it for being so well-written and engrossing.

7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,James,721,8,3,"July 28, 2015","As the band's longtime publicist, Dennis McMally had a pretty intimate perspective for telling the story of the Grateful Dead, and he makes use of it in this comprehensive biography of the band, which travels from the group's early days in San Francisco to their sad farewell to Jerry Garcia.All of the band members get their time in the spotlight, but as the group's defining presence, Jerry is a key focus. McNally stretches back to Garcia's childhood, taking us through the loss of his father, his estrangement from his mother, an aimless adolescence, a failed stint in the military, and finally a full-bore obsession with music. Jerry started out looking to be an expert banjo picker in a bluegrass band, but a trip through the segregation-era south scared him off that audience and moved him in the direction of rock and roll instead. While giving lessons at a local guitar school, he fell in with a group of musicians that eventually included Pigpen McKernan (a local greaser kid), Bill Kreutzmann (a teen-group drummer), Bob Weir (a thrill-seeking rich kid), Phil Lesh (who went from music school to delivering the mail), and eventually Mickey Hart (a drum freak from out east).The stories of the band jelling are richly captured by McNally, with a nice dose of commune living, free love and San Francisco psychedelia. The band is so loosely organized, and unconcerned with pleasing crowds, that it's a wonder they made a living at all. But they do, persevering to travel the world, play thousands of jams and become millionaires.McNally is a big fan of the band, and at times his writing can be too credulous about their larger, cosmic, impact. It's hard not to scoff when you come across passages like the following: “In the course of the fall’s shows, the six of them took their new material and became the Grateful Dead. Playing together night after night while high as could be, they quite often found themselves in a state of grace, and they discovered they were on a mission from God, serving the universe and evolution.”But ""A Long Strange Trip"" is a warts-and-all treatment. McNally dedicates pages to the band's self-absorption, sharing how the same all-encompassing commitment to music that fueled their careers often made a shambles of their personal lives. He also lays out decades worth of shallow pranks on the road, bad, drugged-out shows and back-stabbings delivered via the grapevine. Jerry Garcia in particular seemed to have a damning tendency to duck and run at signs of trouble, and you come away feeling the band was largely self-centered and unreliable. The good shows were great, but there were a lot of tossed-off ones too, it seems, and when their scene fell on hard drugs there were some tragic casualties.Still, it's fascinating to read about the Grateful Dead's unlikely ascent, and it's nice to get a firsthand look at the circumstances behind some of their biggest successes. McNally focuses largely on the concerts and the music, leaving out much exploration of the Dead's ties to cultural of industry trends beyond the initial Haight-Ashbury scene. But their long career gives him plenty of fodder, even if the book may be overly detailed for a casual fan.In the end, Robert Hunter's ""Ten Commandments of Rock and Roll,"" recorded here, just about sum it up. The group is far from perfect, but they were fiercely independent and in a class of their own.1. Suck up to the Top Cats.2. Do not express independent opinions.3. Do not work for common interest, only factional interests.4. If there’s nothing to complain about, dig up some old gripe.5. Do not respect property or persons other than band property or personnel.6. Make devastating judgments on persons and situations without adequate information.7. Discourage and confound personal, technical and/or creative projects.8. Single out absent persons for intense criticism.9. Remember that anything you don’t understand is trying to fuck with you.10. Destroy yourself physically and morally and insist that all true brothers do likewise as an expression of unity.Additional Quotes“Born Wolfgang Grajonza in Berlin in 1931, [Bill Graham] was sent to a Parisian orphanage ahead of the Nazis in 1939, soon joining sixty-three other children in a terrifying escape from Paris to Lisbon by foot, bus, and train. From Lisbon they traveled to Casablanca, from there to Dakar, then to New York. Only eleven children survived the trip. At that, he was luckier than many of his relatives, some of whom died, or his sister Ester, who endured and somehow survived the concentration camp at Auschwitz. In New York he grew up to be a pugnacious Bronx hustler, interested in sports, Latin dancing, and gambling. He waited tables and ran a gambling sideline in the Catskills, then served in Korea, where he earned one Bronze Star for bravery and two courts-martial for insubordination.”“Stephen Gasking, a power in the freak community, replied, ‘Bill, we’ve heard that rap many times before.

7283,A Long Strange Trip The Inside History of the Grateful Dead,Hillbilly,457,19,3,"April 7, 2019","I once met a fellow who told me he had just read the worst book of his life and I quickly zoned out as he explained why. When he got to Chapter six, 45 minutes later I finally snapped ""Why in the hell are you making me suffer through every horrible detail? Can we talk about a book you did like?"" I feel this book was a little like that. There was an incredible amount of detail about their bad performances, while major events, incredible shows, deaths and important pieces we didn't know about were mentioned as an aside, if at all. There was no mention of Jerry's performance on 10/1/94 where he killed every single song, and late in the game changed the lyrics of So Many Roads just this once to Heal My Soul. No mention of Jerry's 50th birthday, and only little hints at the eerie ""coincidences"". For instance he did confirm that the Grateful Dead were playing Fire on the Mountain when Mt. St. Helens erupted but failed to mention Compton Terrace '94 when Jerry brought back Here Comes Sunshine for the first time since 19 and 74 and litcherally as he hit the first chord the black clouds, torrential rains and cool air were instantly replaced by sunshine and oppressive heat. He portrayed Bobby as a kid with an inferiority complex who became a bitchy, prima donna who held resentments worse than my third ex wife. He portrayed Phil and Mickey as perfectionist, virtuoso's who expected the same from everyone else and split most of their time between micro-pretension and macro-aggression. He said Jerry was the leader who would not lead as if anarchy were a dirty word. If he had ""led"" there would have been resentments that he was a controlling, power hungry, ego driven megalomaniac. He portrayed the fans of the 80's as consumer driven, Deader than thou, narcissistic, Nitrous Oxide sucking, arm swinging gate-crashers. Okay, so he nailed that one but really it was only a few jokers. Besides, every generation thinks they're better and more wise than the next. It's not like we stabbed people at Altamont, killed a pregnant movie star to start a race war, killed a president, his brother and Civil Rights Heros like your generation Dennis. For the most part things don't change that much, however we did start becoming inundated with twenty four hour news in the 80's so it appeared as if bad stuff was happening more often by the weaponized media to scare people back into submission after the revolution of the previous generation. It must be inherent in western society to feel the need to feel better than, terminally unique, and make invidious distinctions. I've seen it in every sub-culture I've witnessed including but not limited to business, social work, Mormons, Baptists, 12 step recovery fellowships, athletes, dudes and all their ""conquests"" and mean girls who for years I thought were giving me the elevator eyes until I realized they were looking at, judging and snarling at the eye candy holding my hand and laughing (most likely at my incredibly witty, relevant, and unique humor). To be honest I've rarely seen any of the boys since Brent died and just a handful since Jerry did. I guess I understand there was not much personal detail in this tome because I wouldn't want everyone to know every detail of my life. I'm sure it was a tremendous burden for Jerry. I have a hard enough time showing up and being ""on"" at work and home everyday and I don't have 50,000 kids watching, expecting me to blow their minds every night. I think he also left out the most important point so I actually wonder who he had access to and who spoke to him and how much truth they told him. I've heard Jerry and Phil say they set out to create a new form of art that relied heavily on audience participation. They wanted to co-mingle music, lights and dance and sister did they succeed at that. For one or two moments, many decades ago, I was able to combine my heart and soul with a band beyond description and 15,000 outcast, freaky friends into one blissful, tribal, soul-melting dance. I had no idea I'd still be alive, let alone deconstructing their songs, shows and lives 30 years later. It's like I tell my super aggressive power, sculpt, cardio, core, yoga instructors, ""If I knew then I'd be in this class at 5:00 am I would have taken much better care of myself and not smoked so very, very many drugs."" Oh well, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.",1 like,N/A
