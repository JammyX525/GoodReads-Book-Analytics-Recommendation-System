57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Matt Jasper,12,4,4,"September 19, 2009","I recommend this book to people through my work all the time (Disclaimer: I work in the music business). When I was hired, my boss commanded me to read this book. It really is the definitive starting point for understanding how the music industry works. You can get the overview, or the advanced view, depending on how far you want to dive in. Passman has a good sense of humor, even about subjects that can cause musicians' eyes to start to glaze in many other industry guidebooks. Be on the lookout for the 7th edition, about to come out!",5,1 comment
57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Abby,37,19,4,"March 15, 2013","For school. Already had a copy from over ten years ago, but finally updated to the newest edition. Passman is great about including accurate and relevant information as the industry continues to change. Have heard this labeled ""the music business bible"" time and again, with due reason.",5,N/A
57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Tim Gordon,407,4,4,"July 14, 2020","Well...now I know everything about the Music Business.Truthfully, the title is a misnomer. It really should be ""All You Need to Know About the Bloodsucking Lawyers Within the Music Business."" Because that's really what it is. It was written by a lawyer, and the lawyer side of things take predominance. Though that title wouldn't sell nearly as many copies.And since lawyers are basically America's version of The Mafia, knowing how to run through the loopholes is absolutely essential.This book is designed for people who are already musicians with a budding music career. Those who have products to sell and at least some buyers interested in picking it up. If you want something a little more ground level, a little bit more about how to get things going from the start, then you'll need to look elsewhere.Which, coincidentally, is what I'm trying to create right now. Considering I stumbled upon this book on my library's randomly recommended book list, it seems serendipitous that it'd recommend potential competitors to my start up.But enough about me. This is a well written, easy to understand book. I would 100% recommend it to anyone looking to sign a contract in the music world. This will help you keep your work yours. And most likely keep those billable hours down.",1 like,N/A
57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Gemma Laurence,26,1 follower,5,"September 20, 2020","I've had this book recommended to me by a LOT of people – a major A&R executive, a music manager, my career counselor at Middlebury, the list goes on! I'm really glad I finally got around to reading it. It's a super informative book on the ins and outs of the music industry - the roles of labels, music publishers, managers, and agents, how sync licensing works, how streaming is affecting the music economy and indie artists, if it's worth signing with a label, how to negotiate a production contract, merchandising, etc. It's written from a legal perspective, but the language Donald Passman uses is very accessible and entertaining. I'm not sure it's ALL you need to know about the music business, but it's essentially ""How to Get Started In the Music Business Without Getting Ripped Off."" Essential reading for any artist kicking off their career.",1 like,N/A
57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Matt B,29,1 follower,3,"February 26, 2016","Not for the casual music fan (such as myself) who is curious about the industry. This is for people in the trenches of the business.From a writing perspective, the first half of the book is interesting and even funny at times. The second half is a grueling death march of absolute boredom. The author himself seems a little bored as the topics become dull.",1 like,N/A
57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Stephanie,135,5,5,"June 26, 2020","Exceptionally well written, informative handbook made for frequent referencing. I took up this read out of pure curiosity and found myself note taking for a few days. Donald is super detailed and amazing in ensuring every type of reader is reached. I will definitely be re-reading this as well as recommending it to well every entrepreneur. ",1 like,N/A

57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,DJ Satoda,107,9,3,"August 25, 2020","Really comprehensive look into the music industry! Passman makes it very easy for a complete outsider to learn a bit about the business, including explicitly demarcating a “fast track” that skips more nitty-gritty nuance ",1 like,N/A
57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,David DeLoach,29,1 follower,5,"November 15, 2020","Read the 2nd edition years ago and now the updated 10th edition. Passman does a really good job explaining the modern world of music streaming.If you want to make a living in music, you MUST read this book. It is a stark reality check about what you have to plow thru and endure.",1 like,N/A

57570,All You Need to Know about the Music Business,Al Medina,24,3,5,"May 15, 2018","I read this a looooooong time ago when I aspired to break into the (music) business. It truly is ALL you need to know about the music business. I'm thinking that what I read back then doesn't apply to today's scene but I'm also sure there have been updated versions of this book with additions and revisions. And, considering that I was reminded that I read this by a recent pic that someone had posted to facebook, it would appear that this book (or, at least the updated versions) may still be relevant.",N/A,N/A

As I referred to it with my friends, the Passman - the bible of the music business - was super informative and educational. When I have to, I will dive back into it for the specifics. It was a little dry, even though Passman tries to work around the dry moments with his humour",N/A,N/A

A comprehensive and honestly-written guide to the music industry, which demonstrates why it makes less and less sense to hand over your music's ownership to those (major labels) who are not remotely willing to give the artists the profit share they deserve.",N/A,N/A
