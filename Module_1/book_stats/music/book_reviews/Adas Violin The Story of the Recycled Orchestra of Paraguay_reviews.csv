27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Brina,873,4,5,"July 30, 2020","Ada Rios lives with her family in Cateura, Paraguay, a slum built on a landfill that services the capital city of AsunciÃ³n. The majority of people in the town work as gancheros (recyclers) in the landfills, and houses are built on the flood plain and worth next to nothing. The outlook for a child being raised in these conditions is dismal if not worse. Adaâ€™s grandmother desired that her grandchildren Ada and Noelia have a better life than the one that generations of Cateuraâ€™s citizens have lead. With a embroiderer or cleaning woman considered a good job, the future does not look bright for the next generation of Caeturaâ€™s youth. This changes one day when Favio Chavez arrives and advertises music lessons. Ada has always wanted to be a musician and now she has her chance. At the initial lesson ten students show up, but Favio only has five instruments- violin, guitar, chelo. The students would need to practice at home as well but there are not enough instruments to go around. Trained as an ecological engineer, he has an idea: with the help of the gancheros, Favio will construct an orchestra out of recycled materials. Adaâ€™s first violin includes materials as cardboard and a fork. Soon there are enough instruments to go around and the popularity of the orchestra sky rockets. After much time and practice, the orchestra grows to two hundred children and twenty five instructors. Eventually, the group is named the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay. They earn exposure and are asked to go on tour with Metallica, leading to giddy eyed teenagers who never thought it was possible to travel the world playing music. Susan Hood and Sally Wern Comport have collaborated into an exquisite picture book for children. The story is inspiring for kids everywhere, showing them that it is does not matter where one comes from, if adults invest in the future and kids dream big, there will always be a way to achieve those goals. Comportâ€™s illustrations are stunning and make the Hoodâ€™s story come alive. I obtained my copy from the library, but all proceeds from this book benefit the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay. Favio Chavez and the teenagers of Caetura deserve it. They went from having no hope to improving their station in life to music being their means to achieve a bright future wherever it takes them. An inspiring story for the next generation. 5 ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ¼ ðŸŽµ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¾ stars ",36,2
27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Lisa Vegan,"2,734",1200,5,"March 21, 2017","Thanks to GR friend Crystal for letting me know about this book. I knew about this orchestra. Iâ€™d seen the 60 Minutes television story and had heard about the movie and had seen them in the news. The last 3 pages of this book upped it to 5 stars for me. More information, photos, resources, and I was happy to see that the publisher had made a donation to the orchestra/community. The true story is 5 stars without question. The way it was told, even though interviews with the founder & conductor and one of the musicians made up the basis for a lot of the text, was good, but something seemed lacking to me. Perhaps I would have liked to read a full length book about these people and this orchestra. What was presented whetted my appetite for more. The illustrations are wonderful in that they perfectly fit the story and their intricacy is interesting. While beautiful and I love how much there is to view, Iâ€™m not wild about their style, though I appreciate how theyâ€™re more sophisticated than the illustrations in many other childrenâ€™s picture books.Iâ€™d say this book is best for school aged kids, perhaps 5-10 and then all the way up. Itâ€™s a story/book that can be appreciated by both children and adults. Be prepared for questions and some discussion about poverty, garbage & recycling, musical instruments, etc.Reading this I felt inspired and uplifted, and a bit sad too. Highly recommended, especially for musicians and artists & craftspeople, those who like to learn about other cultures, teachers, those who like reading about real life creative solutions to problems, and all who appreciate stories about people who make a difference. 4 Â½ stars, rounded up because of the importance of the story",29,11
27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Hilary ,"2,150",393,5,"May 30, 2017","This inspiring book tells the story of Ada, a young girl living in Paraguay in a neighbourhood that earns money from recycling rubbish from the enormous amounts of waste the city churns out. An environmental engineer who was working in the area noticed the lack of a constructive outlet for the children and started to give music lessons. Lacking enough instruments to go round some talented local people started to make instruments from recycled materials found in the rubbish heap.Truly inspiring how these children persevered with their learning despite far from ideal conditions. Thank you to good read friend Lisa Vegan for alerting me to this amazing orchestra. There is a link on Lisa's review to a 60 minute YouTube clip that is really worth a look. I was sceptical that a violin and cello made out of tin could actually produce a sound that could be listened to, but they sound amazing.I really enjoyed reading the factual page at the end of the book, I hope some of these children are able to continue with their music, they are amazing. This story would be an excellent starting point for a class music project.",13,5
27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Abigail,"7,083",173,4,"March 17, 2021","Author Susan Hood and illustrator Sally Wern Comport join forces in this immensely moving look at Paraguay's 'Recycled Orchestra,' a symphony made up of children from one of South America's poorest slums, playing instruments created from trash items taken from the dump around which their village was built. The story focuses on Ada RÃ­os, a young girl in Cateura, a village of gancheros (recyclers) that sprung up beside the main trash dump for Paraguay's capital city of AsunciÃ³n. Part of a music-loving family, Ada had little chance to pursue this subject until engineer and amateur musician Favio ChÃ¡vez came to town, offering free lessons to the children there. When there weren't enough instruments to go around, ChÃ¡vez and the children had to get creative, making their own homemade instruments from what they could find. Learning to play together, the orchestra improved, eventually giving their first concert. Ada herself was made first violin, and the group became better and better known, garnering invitations to play, not just in other cities, but in other countries as well...Although I have been aware of Ada's Violin: The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay since its publication back in 2016, and although I am interested in the subject, I never seem to have gotten around to it until now. I'm glad I finally did, as I found it to be an immensely moving and inspirational book, pairing a story that had me tearing up on more than one occasion with gorgeous mixed media artwork that had me poring over the pages. The style of artwork created by Sally Wern Comport here - she used collage, acrylic glazes and paints, drawing and digital media - is well-suited to the story, as it incorporates various recycled objects (like bits of paper) into the visuals. So too did Ada and her friends incorporate found objects into their instruments, creating music and art from something that others found useless. The story highlights the resilience of the human spirit and the creativity of the human mind, as people with almost nothing find a way to make the world around them more beautiful. I was pleased to learn, in the extensive afterword, that the orchestra has raised money to improve the lives of the people of Cateura. As someone who is a fan of the rock band Metallica, I was also pleased to discover that the orchestra performed with them, in a massive concert in Colombia. Kudos to Metallica for having them as an opening act - I will definitely be seeking out the video of that performance, as well as the 60 Minutes special devoted to the orchestra. Highly recommended to picture-book readers looking for stories about poverty, creativity, recycling and making music.",11,7

So sad about kids and people living near the landfills and looking through landfill for something valuable to sell for survival. An inspiring story as well. Chavez decided to teach children in town to keep them out of trouble. They were short on instruments so they use the landfill for materials to build their own instruments and it paid off. The children practice a lot and became good at playing music. Eventually, They were invited to play all over the world.Read from kindle unlimited.",10,N/A
27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Stephanie Anze,657,110,4,"May 18, 2018","Cateura, Paraguay is a landfill. Its also home to dozens of families that earn their living by selling what they can rescue from the trash. That was perhaps the only thing Cateura was known for. Now Cateura is on the map for another reason: The Children's Recycled Orchestra. When Favio Chavez went back to Paraguay, he started music lessons for the children but lacking enough instruments, he decided to make his own. In time, his small orchestra caught international attention and has since shown the world how ingenuity and perseverance can change a community.Never before has the phrase ""One man's trash is another man's tresuare"" been more true. Cateura is the dump site for Paraguay. Receiving tons of trash per year, the main income source for the families living there is digging through the trash and selling anything salvageable. When Favio Chavez, an environmental technician, arrived to implemnt safety features for the recyclers he wanted to give back to his community. As a musician, he started teaching the children but he had more kids than instruments. In a community where a music instrument is worth more than a house, Chavez had to be resourceful. He used the one thing that Cateura has in excess: trash. With the help of a carpenter, Chavez built violins, drums and other instruments from scraps and trash. In time, his group was called the Recycled Orchestra.I love this story, its moving and inspirational. I had not heard about this group before and now I wish for everyone to know of them. The prose is great as are the illustrations. The impact of this story is even greater. The Recycled Orchestra has performed in South America, North America, Europe, Asia and beyond. They have gone on tour with Metallica and Megadeth and performed alongside Stevie Wonder. They have been asked to perform for monarchs, politicians and even Pope Francis. This is the testament of a man and group of kids that turned literal trash into treasure beyond measure. There is a documentary of the Recycled Orchestra and I plan on watching it. As for the boook, its a must read for people of all ages. Just amazing.",8,N/A
27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Chris,944,14,5,"June 16, 2016"," Nonfiction picture books that tell true stories of what's going on in other parts of the world draw me like a bee to nectar. And when they're well told, illustrated beautifully, and loaded with pertinent information, I'm one happy teacher. However, I don't have a classroom in which to share this book anymore, and this is a book to be shared and discussed. Perfect for the intermediate-grade classroom that is learning about how to make a difference in our world. I can't imagine a town that's built on, at, or even near a huge garbage dump. What a wake-up message for kids AND adults. Lots of additional information so that I can look and learn more, and maybe even help a bit.....",8,1 comment
27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Alex  Baugh,"1,946",107,5,"May 26, 2017","Living in Cateura, Paraguay, where scouring the trash from nearby AsunciÃ³n to recycle and resell is a way of life, Ada RÃ­os liked to imagine that truckload of garbage was ""a box of surprises."" And that turns out to be just what they are when Favio ChÃ¡vez arrived in town and offers music lessons to the children of Cateura. With more children wanting music lessons than instruments to play, ChÃ¡vez knew he had to do something. After experiments, trials, mistakes and finally success, instruments were fashioned for the children from Cateura's garbage dump and the Recycled Orchestra was born, and it didn't take long for them to become world renowned musicians, including Ada and her violin. Comport's beautiful mixed media collages carry the theme of music throughout, including bits of paper with musical notes on them in the garbage piles. She has captured what life is like living so close to a dump so well, you can almost smell it. The author includes important back matter about the Recycled Orchestra.",5,N/A

  Buried in the trash was music. And buried in themselves was something to be proud of.
Ada's Violin is the perfect picture book for kids who like true stories about other places and other cultures. It discusses the overwhelming poverty and hopelessness of the slum where Ada and her family live in Paraguay, but it also does a lovely job of portraying her close-knit family in a positive light. This is mirrored in the hope and aspirations of new arrival Favio ChÃ¡vez and the orchestra he helped this community build. The sections of the book discussing creating instruments from recycled trash were especially fun and finding an art project where kids can build their own (e.g. PVC pipe flutes) would be a perfect complementary activity. Comport's collage backgrounds are truly lovely. Best suited for grades 2-5.",5,N/A

27206444,Adas Violin The Story of the Recycled Orchestra of Paraguay,Krista the Krazy Kataloguer,"3,873",263,5,"June 6, 2018","Amazing story of a music teacher and his poverty-stricken students who create an orchestra of instruments out of junk and learn to play them. What a testament to the power of recycling and of music! I visited some of the web sites about these kids listed at the back of the book. Not only do the instruments sound almost like real ones made of traditional materials, but these kids are playing Vivaldi and sounding darned good! The band Metallica was so impressed with them that they asked the Recycled Orchestra to open for them in a series of concerts they gave in Central and South America. The girl Ada, who is featured in this book, is interviewed in one of the videos. So awe-inspiring! I highly recommend this bookâ€”and watch the videos too. You will be amazed.",4,5
