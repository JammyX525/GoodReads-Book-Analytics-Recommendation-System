1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Julie Ehlers,"1,111",1372,3,"August 16, 2020","A few weeks ago I listened to Blood on the Tracks while making dinner one night. It had been years since I'd listened to it all the way through, but listening to a great album after years away is always a fantastic experience: you're reminded that it's great for a reason. It's not just superb art but also a lot of fun to listen to. Suddenly I wanted to be reading a book about Bob Dylan. I had two in the house, A Freewheelin' Time and Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Fariña, and Richard Fariña, and A Freewheelin' Time seemed like something my pandemic brain could handle.Suze Rotolo is the woman on the cover of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan and was in a serious relationship with Dylan for a few years; her portrayal of Dylan seems honest but, as the subtitle implies, this memoir is more about the whole milieu of the Village in the sixties—the music scene and the activist/political scene. Rotolo was a visual artist, so some time is also spent detailing her years in art school in Italy. The writing was quite basic but it was fun to learn about this particular period of U.S. cultural history. While I was reading this I also watched Scorsese's 3-hour Dylan documentary, No Direction Home, over several nights, and if you decide to read this book I recommend you do that as well—it was fun and helpful to be able to put faces and voices to the many people the book mentions, including Rotolo herself. However, if i'm being honest it would be just as much fun to watch the documentary and skip the book altogether.",21,7
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Lynx,198,79,5,"February 10, 2018","As a “red diaper baby” with two Communist parents, political activism was built into Suze’s DNA. As a young teenager she began hanging out in Greenwich Village with other like-minded friends and was soon a fixture at clubs such as Gerdes Folk City, The Gaslight, Kettle of Fish and The Bitter End. Places that launched the careers of many folk singers such as Dave Van Ronk, Judy Collins, Peter, Paul & Mary, Odetta and of course Bob Dylan.When remembering their first encounter, Bob said “I couldn’t take my eyes off her. She was the most erotic thing I’d ever seen. We started talking and my head started to spin. Cupids arrow had whistled past my ears before, but this time it hit me in the heart and the weight of it dragged me overboard.” Just like that Dylan met his first, and most important Muse. Bob had only recently moved to NYC from his small town in Minnesota and it was through Suze that he would not only discover many of the poets and writers that would greatly influence his work but also learn about the political issues he would soon be known for writing about.But as Dylan began to make a name for himself Suze could feel hers being diminished. “All that was offered to a musicians girlfriend in the early 60’s was a role as her boyfriend’s “chick”, a string on his guitar. In the case of Bob’s rising fame, I would be gatekeeper, one step closer to an idol. People would want to know me just to get closer to him. My significance would be based on his greater significance. That idea did not entice.”But Suze was much more than just a string on Dylan’s guitar. Or the girl walking down the street with him on the cover of A Freewheelin’ Time. In her book she discusses not only their relationship, but also gives an insiders look at 60's Greenwich Village and the numerous political issues the were at the forefront of their world.I recently discussed Suze and her amazing life in an episode of my podcast Muses and Stuff.

1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Adrienne,263,16,4,"February 4, 2009","I have mixed feelings about this book but overall I liked it. On the one hand, the writing isn’t stellar and Rotolo bounces all over the place chronologically and thematically. I found myself often having to go back and figure out where we were in the time line (which isn’t a very accurate term because there is no “line” of time involved here). On the other hand, this book is extremely valuable for its insight into Bob Dylan. Rotolo’s is a unique perspective on Dylan’s transformation from an unknown musician to the phenomenon he became during the years they were together. Who else in the world could tell a better story about that? Nobody. If you love Bob Dylan and/or the Village, Rotolo’s stories are great. And if you don’t, then why would you read this book in the first place?Maybe one problem is that the book seems to be attempting too much. Is it Suze’s story? Dylan’s story? Greenwich Village’s story? The story of the sixties? Obviously they all overlap and each could and should appear in the story of the others, but there doesn’t seem to be a clear focus. At any given time, the focus is on one or another, with the others making little “cameos”. This lack of focus may have contributed to the overall chaotic feeling of the book. One thing is for sure--the subtitle of the book, “A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties”, is not completely representative of the book’s contents.One thing I found very interesting is that Rotolo mentions several times that she didn’t want to be the “supportive woman behind the great man”. She says she wanted to create her own success, separate from her role as the musician’s girlfriend. But isn’t it ironic that the jobs she did most often were things like building stage props and being in charge of sound or lighting for plays? Even when she was encouraged to be an actress and made callbacks, she turned away from it. She kind of filled the supportive role even when she was no longer with Bob. In the end, I gave the book four stars because it is very interesting (sometimes you have to skim to find the good stuff but it’s definitely there). It offers a unique look at Bob Dylan and contains some pearls of wisdom and insight about life in general. I especially liked how human Dylan appears through Rotolo’s eyes. So often, he is seen as an enigma, a God, some untouchable, unknowable genius, etc. But this book shows him as a romantic, a heartbroken lover, an image-conscious artist, a sensitive friend…a human.

1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,KOMET,"1,049",126,5,"March 15, 2016","Suze Rotolo has written a book based in part on her relationship with Bob Dylan, as well as one that recaptures the essence of a decade (the 1960s) that set in train both progressive-revolutionary and reactionary forces that transformed the world in ways that affect it to this day. Though I was born in the 1960s (in fact, the same year that the Beatles came to the U.S.), my memories of it are largely personal and seen as vignettes and random images as one would find in a photo album. So, I am thankful for memoirs such as this which help to give me a more solid sense of what that time was really like. For Rotolo, ""the sixties were an era that spoke a language of inquiry and curiosity and rebelliousness against the stifling and repressive political and social culture of the decade that preceded it. The new generation causing all the fuss was not driven by the market: we had something to say, not something to sell."" Rotolo shares with the reader much of her early life in Queens as the youngest child of 2 leftist parents, her subsequent escape while in her teens (following the premature death of her father, an artist by training) to Greenwich Village, where she took in the burgeoning folk music scene and first met Bob Dylan early in 1961. It is a rich, fascinating, and well-told memoir. This is a book to be savored and read again when one seeks reaffirmation in the possibility of helping build a more open, just, and better society through artistic expression. ",5,N/A
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Jammin Jenny,"1,341",180,4,"January 24, 2021","I really enjoyed this memoir written by Suze Rotolo, a close friend of Bob Dylan's, talking about their life (and more specifically her life) in the 1960s. It was interesting hearing some behind the scenes action of those days, the interactions with Andy Warhol, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the New York Subway Strike. A really good read for anyone interested in those times or the music of that period.",4,N/A
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Ben,18,1 follower,4,"April 10, 2008","So, thanks to H and L, I managed to get a reviewer's copy of Suze Rotolo's new memoir ""A Freewheelin' Time"" and devoured it over the weekend. As Todd Haynes says on the back, this is a welcome perspective - finally, the voice of a woman at the epicenter of the 60's folk scene, speaking strongly and warmly and passionately about what she saw and what happened.So what prompted this amazing book? Why, after years of silence did she finally open up? In the ""Acknowledgments"" section at the end of the book she thanks Jeff Rosen who interviewed her for ""No Direction Home"" and says that he ""opened the door to the past and gently led [her] through it."" And so, in addition to my deep gratitude to Suze for opening up her life, some thanks also goes to Mr. Rosen.She does an excellent job of describing her childhood, her family, and life as a ""red diaper baby"" in Queens during the 40's and 50's. And she's able to weave all of that into her time in the Village, her time with Bob, and her life after Bob. She comes into focus as a real person with a poetic, but not naive voice. Her descriptions of life as a woman in a circle of artists - her frustration at being called a ""chick"" and treated like a ""guitar string"" on Bob's guitar - are amazingly accurate. The irony of life for women, during Civil Rights, being treated as second class even among progressives (folksingers, artists, etc.), is acutely observed.Her personal political journey is fascinatingly told as well - from the child of Communists reading ""The God Who Failed"" on the subway, to her thoughts about repression of artists under both capitalist and communist systems once she visits Prague and Cuba.The media is probably going to jump on a few key passages - namely the three paragraphs where she describes her pregnancy, and subsequent abortion of Bob's child. This occurred after she moved out of Bob's West Fourth Street apartment and she was living on Avenue B. Some early news reports suggested that she was going to shy away from addressing this directly, perhaps saying simply that she ""lost"" the child. However, the copy I have, doesn't dodge the issue at all. But like other sensitive topics in the book it's handled delicately.She describes Dylan, upon first meeting him, as ""funny, engaging, intense, and.. persistent"" and that those words completely describe him - only their order would shift depending on the situation. Sharp observations like this are throughout the book - she sees and feels keenly, then writes it well.The book is full of great, rich, stories - stolen moments. Dylan and Suze going to MOMA to see Guernica. How Suze and Terri Thal smoothed out Dylan's theft of Von Ronk's version of ""Rising Sun."" The route of their favorite walk home through the village - past Zito's bakery for late night bread.Other interesting tid-bits for Dylan-o-philes include: * Ian Tyson giving Dylan pot for the first time. * Watching Jack Ruby shoot Lee Harvey Oswald on live TV in her Avenue B apartment with Dylan and her sister Carla, then going to see Lenny Bruce a few days later - hoping he'd have some answers, some way to make sense of things - and realizing he didn't. * The way she describes her realization that Baez and Dylan were having an affair - and the pain of private events being made public. * The story of her time in Italy, why she went, how she felt, and excerpts from the often funny, very heartfelt letters Dylan sent her while there. * Stories of her and Dylan's friendships with other Village folks, including Dave Von Ronk (and wife Terri), Noel Stookey, Paul Clayton, Mell and Lillian Bailey, Phil Ochs.. with cameos by Bill Cosby, Woody Allen, Odetta, and the list goes on. Its not perfect by any means - sometimes the stories jump around a bit too much, or the descriptions are a bit perfunctory, or the focus is too much on her (ignoring for example her sister's record collection and efforts to promote Bob to Robert Shelton and others - described in Heylin's Behind the Shades). But that's all understandable - its her story after all.The book folds perfectly into Chronicles and Positively Fourth Street - providing a counterpoint, a fresh voice - full of strength and warmth and wisdom. It tells a story we haven't heard before, but needed to all along. ",4,N/A
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Donna,335,12,5,"June 8, 2008","In her book American Bloomsbury, Susan Cheever writes about the amazing proximity in time and place of the great writers and thinkers who came together in Concord, Massachusetts, in the 19th Century—Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, the Alcotts, and others. She notes that such “genius clusters” seem to occur regularly throughout history. They represent every area of human endeavor, including the arts, philosophy, science, politics and social change. In A Freewheelin’ Time, Suze Rotolo documents just such a phenomenon, which occurred in Greenwich Village in the early 1960s. The music that came out of that time and place moved and inspired a whole generation—my generation—and significantly changed the world.I was 13 in 1962, when I went to New York for the first time. My cousin Glenn gave me some albums by Joan Baez, and I was stunned by the power of her voice and words of her songs. Later, my frame of reference was shaped by the songs of Bob Dylan, Paul Stookey, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, and many others whose names I didn’t know at the time and probably still don’t. I fell in love with the folk music of Peter, Paul and Mary, Simon and Garfunkle, Judy Collins, Pete Seeger. At the same time—without associating it with the music I loved—I always yearned to see the place with the seemingly magical name of “Greenwich Village.” I had a powerful sense of having just missed something, but I didn’t know what.Suze Rotolo’s book finally helped me understand the mystique of that time and place. By the time I finally went back to New York and got to visit the famous neighborhood, everything had changed. It was 1972, and the poets and minstrels had moved on. It was August, and the temperature and humidity were both in the 90s. I saw a man in an overcoat sleeping on the street. I was too late. I went back to the west coast, to a culture I understood, and all these years, I wondered what I’d missed. Now--thanks to this remarkably forthright chronicle--I know.",4,N/A
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Nick,678,29,3,"May 5, 2011","Okay, I'm nostalgic about the Sixties. I enjoyed this memoir of Greenwich Village in the early 1960's--despite the cover photo and Rotolo's well-known status as Bob Dylan's girlfriend at the time, she writes about so much more than Dylan. This book covers, among other things, the Red Scare and its effect on left-wing families; the folk revival; experimental theater; the Cuban Revolution and the ban on travel to Cuba; and Rotolo's childhood and early adulthood. It's very engaging, and near the end she states a truth that needs to be stated now more than ever: the Sixties wasn't just about sex drugs and rock and roll, it was about making a better world.

1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Erik Graff,"4,983",1082,3,"February 19, 2018","While there's much mention of Bob Dylan, this is basically an autobiography by his one-time girlfriend, Suze Rotolo. It is as well an homage to the 60s scene in Greenwich Village and to youth itself.Rotolo writes without apparent conceit, conveying the sense that hers is a true self-portrait--not deeply analytical, but true, even familiar. I've known persons like Suze Rotolo.I read much of Rotolo's story aloud with Chelsea Rectanus, owner of a local used bookstore--a pleasant shared experience.",4,N/A

1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Shannon Bett,31,3,2,"July 24, 2009","I have to admit, I only read this because it was cheap and I wanted to suck what juicy marrow I could about Dylan from it. There were a few anecdotes that brought to light the fullness of the Dylan/Rotolo relationship by filling in the gaps left from all the biographies I've read about him. However, I skimmed through the endless ramblings of Rotolo, who through her own words, seems stuck in the idea of proving to the rest of the world, herself and possibly Dylan, that she was more than his girlfriend. I think this would have been obvious through the telling of her own stories but the ""beat"" language and need to ""justify"" herself as more than his girlfriend, took away from her interesting personal history. I am glad she told her story and maybe her need to ""protect"" Bobby kept her from divuldging the truth and complexity behind their years together or maybe the truth is, they weren't as complex as we would like them to be. Maybe they were just two teenagers in love during a time of historical significance. Either way, I think this book will sell simply to those neophyte's hungry for more information or insight into the myth, the legend and the man that is Bobby Dylan. ",3,1 comment
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Billy,45,3,3,"June 7, 2009","This was an enjoyable read. It covers much the same territory as Dave Van Ronk's recent memoir. But, of course, this one was written by Dylan's girlfriend of the time. (She's the one on the cover of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.) There's some new insight into Dylan's rise in the early 60s, and insight into his personality, but, in many ways, Rotolo doesn't reveal much that is new. (In her defense, she seems to respect Dylan's privacy, or better said, the privacy of the relationship the two of them once had, so she is pretty restrained in her descriptions of their lives together, and of his shortcomings.) Basically, I love reading about this period, she was there, and she tells good story.",3,N/A
1438457,A Freewheelin Time A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties,Tom Choi,61,1 follower,4,"August 9, 2017","I was struck by the charity of Suze Rotolo's reflections on Bob Dylan. She strips her reminiscence of self-aggrandizement and tabloid-minded sensationalism. While Bob Dylan is still remains a bit of a mystery in the end (he was really that aloof all along), Rotolo remembers the little moments that sheds light on the Artist as a Young Man: the sweet love letters, the nights of cigarettes, coffee and conversation, and his confident, burning ambition.But this book is more than ""Bob and Me."" It is a portrait of a Young Woman as an Artist, a story of an Idealist, and an engaging document of the spirit and characters of Greenwich Village in the 1960s. By the way, did you know that Bob Dylan and Bill Crosby crossed circles in the Greenwich Village cafe scene of the 60s? ",3,N/A

This book is just what the subtitle purports: a history of a time (the early sixties) and a place (Greenwich Village). Rotolo was more than a ""singer's chick"" and she provides some interesting insight on that role. Unlike Pattie Boyd in Wonderful Tonight, Rotolo was uncomfortable in the role of muse and unconditional support to her man. She excuses no misbehavior by citing his talent or his demons. Rotolo's voice is strong and she was an interesting young woman in her own right. Consequently, this is a history of the art, theater, and politics of the era, as well as a history of Bob Dylan.",3,N/A

Rotolo states at one point that the autobiography is an ""emotional"" rather than a factual recollection of the time. The book does seem to get better when their relationship is troubled and especially after they break up. It takes Rotolo almost 300 pages to admit, like almost every other book out there about Dylan has stated, that he was basically a jerk.",3,1 comment
