64481,A Northern Light,karen,"3,968",17000,4,"September 20, 2018","this monday-morning float is for you, alfonso!oh, a northern light, you were way better than i expected. i used to get really angry at this book, because it would come up in resort all the time and some people would just shelve it in my section because it looks like a grown-up book, not like teen fiction, and i would always have to be yanking it off the shelves and saying ""nooooo, you go downstairs!!"" like shooing away a mischievous dog. while i was reading it, i loved it.a few days after, i am aware of plenty of weak spots - underwritten parts, the ambition of too many storylines that maybe with a little pruning would have resulted in a fantastic book that i would want to read again and again. but maybe that is what teen fiction is - a stepping stone to truly great literature. i don't mean this to be disparaging (observe how i have grown in my teen fiction stance), but younger readers lack the literary scope of people who have been around the block a few times with a few books. their critical faculties are not as honed as more experienced readers, and so the soft spots an adult reader picks up on go unnoticed by younger readers who are carried away in the power of the narrative voice and the excitement of ""what will happen next"". and that is good enough, really, for teen literature - get them engaged in the text, get them hungry for reading, tell them a new and interesting story and teach them some new words along the way. i am totally content with that.mary k says, somewhat cynically, that books like these are written with the printz award in mind. this was in response, not to this book, but to marcelo in the real world, when i remarked that it would sell quite easily to an adult audience, so i wondered why it was being marketed at teen fiction. this book, as is, i think would not do so well as an adult-fiction title, but the care that went into writing it, and the multilayeredness of it - it is certainly more ambitious than many of the other titles intended for a teen audience, and i say ""three cheers"". the voice of this book is excellent. the main character is very well-drawn, for teen audience or otherwise. but tying together race issues, struggles with poverty, women's issues, a true crime story, and a family drama, just makes for a muddled focus, that you don't necessarily notice during the reading, but afterwards, there is a lot of, ""hm, wonder what happened to thus-and-such"".it's just too much content. i love that she based this whole story around the murder that inspired an american tragedy, but i think even without that storyline, this would have been a wonderful novel of a girl with aspirations above her gender and financial situation, torn between her family and her ambition, with a strong subplot about her best friend's struggles with racial inequality in his own life. done. call it a day.i did love the french canadian uncle (very very familiar voice there) - but many other elements seemed too fleeting. i would have liked more resolution with some of the storylines, but overall, this was a very fine novel, and i won't get mad if it tries to sneak onto my shelves again. i won't let it stay, but i won't frown at it, i will give it a soft, ""oh, you scamp"" kind of look...come to my blog!",124,45
64481,A Northern Light,Aleeeeeza,334,174,5,"August 7, 2012","Last year, I used to go every day to the library of the bank where my dad works at (ain't that a mouthful or what?!)—I was homeschooled, and it was the perfect place to study for upcomin’ exams. There I stumbled upon a Reader’s Digest Condensed Version book, which basically features up to 4 abridged books in one volume, and one of the novels it featured was A Gathering Light by Jennifer Donnelly (which I later found out was called A Northern Light in the states). Since I am the queen of procrastination, I began reading it and soon was so swept away by the beautiful story I couldn’t stop until I was finished. And when I did reached the ending, I loved it so much I was actually CRYING and doing my best not to cheer aloud since I was in, you know, a library.So when I got the chance to order some books from Amazon some time ago, I had only a quota of four books and I selected this one first-up. My sister was confused, since she couldn’t understand why I was ordering a novel I’d already read when I could order a new very-highly-anticipated one. That’s because I love this novel so much it was never even a question I’d get a copy for myself. And soon after it arrived, I began reading it, tossing away the resolution to not before exams (see, exams never seem to end in my life). It was just too tempting! And the book…WOW. The condensed version did NOT do it justice. Because I savored every single word of it and only fell even more in love with it, so much that it’s officially my No. 1 favorite book EVER, Hands. Down. And if you know me, you’ll know it’s not very easy to get that title. But that’s just my history with the book. And now I’ll review it, and hopefully I’ll do it justice so that you’ll go read and fall in love with it too. I mean, it DID win the Carnegie Medal, was a Michael L. Printz Honor book, and fetched numerous blurbs as well as starred reviews, which in itself makes it a must-read book.The first time I read this novel I was a bit puzzled by the simplicity of the prose. At that time, I believed you needed to use Big Words often to be a good writer (thank you, Steph Meyer!), and this novel barely employed any. And I was struck by how, despite this, the novel read so beautifully. And that’s when I learned that the best kind of writing is not the Overwrought Kind, but the one that seems utterly effortless. Mattie is a lover of all things literature, and you wouldn’t believe how well the author has incorporated this fact into the story. This book pretty much nails the rule of ‘show, not tell’. Every day Mattie learns a new word, its origins and all, and does her best to use it in that day. And a fellow word-lover meself (actually, I can safely bet that whoever’s reading this review is also fond of words, right?), I loooved this aspect.And you can see how much she loved words through the following passages:""Well, it seems to me that there are books that tell stories, and then there are books that tell truths...The first kind, they show you life like you want it to be. With villains getting what they deserve and the hero seeing what a fool he's been and marrying the heroine and happy endings and all that. Like Sense and Sensibility or Persuasion. But the second kind, they show you life more like it is. Like in Huckleberry Finn where Huck's pa is a no-good drunk and Jim suffers so. The first kind makes you cheerful and contented, but the second kind shakes you up... Why don't they tell the truth? Why don't they tell how a pigpen looks after the sow's eaten her children? Or how it is for a girl when her baby won't come out? Or that cancer has a smell to it? All those books...I bet not one of them will tell you what cancer smells like... I don't mean to be coarse. I just...I don't know why I should care what happens to people in a drawing room in London or Paris or anywhere else when no one in those places cares what happens to people in Eagle Bay.""""I had looked around. I’d seen all the things she’d spoken of and more besides. I’d seen a bear cub lift its face to the drenching spring rains. And the silver moon of winter, so high and blinding. I’d seen the crimson glory of a stand of sugar maple in autumn and the unspeakable stillness of a mountain lake at dawn. I’d seen them and loved them. But I’d also seen the dark of things. The starved carcasses of winter deer. The driving fury of a blizzard wind. And the gloom that broods under the pines always. Even on the brightest of days.""""What I saw next stopped me dead in my tracks. Books. Not just one or two dozen, but hundreds of them. In crates. In piles on the floor. In bookcases that stretched from floor to ceiling and lined the entire room. I turned around and around in a slow circle, feeling as if I'd just stumbled into Ali Baba's cave. I was breathless, close to tears, and positively dizzy with greed.""The setting is so, so vivid, and I felt as if I were really transported back to the early 1900s. In the same way, I felt like I personally knew every character. And their feelings! They all mirrored mine so perfectly it was almost creepy. Especially how bad Mattie's got it for Royal, her spankin’ good-looking neighbor, regardless of the fact that I knew how hopeless it was. I distinctly remember the first time round I read this book, how my heart both soared with hers and then came crashing down when things got rough.And it’s not just this: Mattie yearning to be both an educated woman and eventually an author, as well as have a family and a loving husband…it was so very relatable. Especially since I often go through the same dilemma, even in this day and age, thanks to the backward society I’m from. I remember this quote really affected me:And I knew in my bones that Emily Dickinson wouldn't have written even one poem if she'd had two howling babies, a husband bent on jamming another one into her, a house to run, a garden to tend, three cows to milk, twenty chickens to feed, and four hired hands to cook for. I knew then why they didn't marry. Emily and Jane and Louisa. I knew and it scared me. I also knew what being lonely was and I didn't want to be lonely my whole life. I didn't want to give up on my words. I didn't want to choose one over the other. Mark Twain didn't have to. Charles Dickens didn't.So, yeah, that’s my review. Jennifer Donnelly is now one of my all-time fave authors, and her novel Revolution also definitely deserves to be read. In fact, if you read both and compare then, you’ll be seriously shocked the same author penned both books. I mean, yes, they’re both at least partially historical, but that’s kind of as far as the similarities go.",99,19
64481,A Northern Light,Tabetha,66,131,4,"December 18, 2015","Rating: 4.5 Review: 
  ""Words fail me sometimes. I have read most every book in the Webster's Dictionary of the English language, but I still have trouble making them come when I want them to. Right now I want a word that describes the feeling you get - a cold sick feeling deep down inside - when you know something is happening that will change you, and you don't want it to, but you can't stop it. And you know, for the first time, for the very first time, that there will be a before and an after, a was and a will be. And that you will never again quite be the same person you were.""
This is the story of Mattie, sixteen years old, and full of the passion and need to express herself, to find her true voice, and to break out of the mold that could trap her into a role, of doing what others want for her. This historic YA novel, set in 1906, weaves in the true crime story of young and hopeful Grace Brown, who was cruelly drowned and murdered by her lover, and who left behind a legacy of love letters, so sad and tragic. Mattie is so deeply affected by this horrific event, that it changes her life's path and her dreams forever.I discovered this Printz Honor awarded novel when I was placing Jennifer Donnelly's newest novel ""These Shallow Graves"" on hold at the library. This is such a beautifully moving story, character driven, with so many different events happening, that I was very involved in this time period of 1905-1906, in the setting of the Adirondack Mountains. There are many deep elements at play, which include the racism of the time period, made all the more personal by Mattie's friend Weaver and his mother, who undergo such hardships, even though they are not, under any circumstances, slaves. There is the beauty of family, and there is also an ugliness that is portrayed, that can occur during times of extreme poverty. There is also the implication that young girls, especially those with little means, had a narrow choice of marrying, while University and careers were still a luxury that not many could afford. Mattie has such a tremendous desire to become a published writer, but her circumstances may prevent those dreams from ever coming to fruition. There are actually two stories of Mattie being told in alternating chapters: one when she comes face to face with Grace Brown's murder, and the next is told a year before, as Mattie attends school and helps her father out with her siblings and the farm. A sweet romance develops, which completely adds to the story, and gives Mattie a new way of looking at the world, of appreciating things other than bookish words and quotes. I highly recommend this coming of age mystery that adults and young adults alike will appreciate.A final quote from the incredible Jennifer Donnelly, ""Voice is not just the sound that comes from your throat, but the feelings that come from your words.""

I remember myself growing up on a beautiful island with my family. I often seeked solitude and I always had a feeling I was supposed to live some place different. When I left the island I took all these memories and stories from home with me! Just like Mattie... Definitely a page-turner!""I believe these things. With all my heart.

64481,A Northern Light,Keertana,"1,126",2162,5,"June 12, 2013","A Northern Light is one of those books you come across every few years; the type of novel that buries itself in your heart from the first page and simply lingers in your thoughts for days, weeks, and even months afterward. Although I've probably read at least two books and three novellas since I set this story down, it has still been in the forefront of my thoughts. I will likely tell my parents to yell at Jennifer Donnelly if they want someone to blame for my bad grades and sleepless nights. After all, how could I have done anything with my life until I knew what happened in Mattie's? And now how can I possible continue do anything without her voice by my side? It's the cruelest kind of paradox, one that only arrives when you love a protagonist as much as this one. Without a doubt, A Northern Light is very possibly the best book I've read - and will read - this year.Prior to having read A Northern Light, the only Donnelly novel I'd read was Revolution, which made me sit up till 3 AM wracked with sobs while I finished the book. Now, let me tell you, that was not a fun reading experience. I had swollen cheeks, red eyes, and an aching heart by the end of it. Needless to say, I more-or-less swore off of Donnelly after that. Any author whose words had that type of power over me was dangerous. Quite thankfully, though, a lovely review convinced me to pick this one up and I'm so very glad I did. A Northern Light is a quiet, unassuming sort of tale, one that is filled with courage and strength and hope instead of despair and death and loss. It isn't always a happy story, but it is a truthful one; it never glosses over the harsh realities of life, especially for women of the time, and it faithfully empowers women in a manner that is never overbearing, merely subtle.Donnelly's A Northern Light is told cleverly with two timelines neatly converging into one, creating an ending that is both satisfying and powerful. When the novel begins, the body of a drowned woman, Grace Brown, is found near the inn where Mattie works. Shortly before leaving for her boat ride, Grace gave Mattie a bundle of letters to burn, but just hours later, Grace herself is found dead. Mattie, suspicious of the circumstances surrounding her death, begins to read the letters Grace gave her. As the contents of these letters are slowly revealed, so is Mattie. For every present-day chapter there are even more chapters from the past, not only detailing Mattie's journey but also showing who she really is. Mattie's story takes place in the early 1900s, a time when women were expected to run a household and raise a family. Mattie, however, yearns to attend college, despite the fact that her mother recently died and her father needs her help on their farm. Although there are many other responsibilities Mattie has, from the beginning itself it is hard not to root for her. After all, this is a protagonist whose love for language pushes her to learn a new word from the dictionary everyday. And though I regard A Northern Light to be a tale that empowers women and celebrates feminism, Mattie herself is no Alice Paul. Instead, what makes her such an endearing and unforgettable protagonist are, first and foremost, her passions and secondly, her own inner battles. While society pushes Mattie towards a life of love and comfort in a house with children, her own heart begins to push her that way too, which makes the decision to chase her dream that much more difficult. All the more, Mattie is not a perfect character. Although one of her best friends is an African American boy who is on his way to Columbia, Mattie doesn’t always treat her own family properly. In fact, these family dynamics are what make the novel so fascinating, what make us keep flipping these pages frantically. Will Mattie convince her father to allow her to go to college? Can the inspirational teacher Mattie had help her in this endeavor? Is Mattie really going to be tied down to her small town by a promise she once made to her dying mother? In such a subtle manner, Donnelly uses Mattie’s life to build her era. Instead of paragraphs of bland information, Mattie’s society is build around her and stems from her perceptions, making this the best kind of historical fiction there is – the kind that doesn’t feel like fiction at all. In all honesty, though, I can keep prattling on about this book for days if you’d allow me. Mattie is such a vivacious, strong, and courageous character that her story captures you from the beginning. You yearn for her to fulfill her dreams, for her to realize her true calling in life and pursue it despite what others may say. You begin to pray that she will somehow escape her small town and farm life. You keep the book aside and tie your hands behind your back because you don’t want to know what happens even though you really do, but you’re so very scared of the outcome. You begin to hope feverishly that her love for her family will not cause her to disregard her love for words; that she will finally gain the opportunity to do what she wants to do. It’s a beautiful book, the kind you’ll always carry around with you – in your heart.",26,5
64481,A Northern Light,Janina,215,526,4,"September 1, 2011","I don’t quite understand why this book hasn’t caught my attention earlier. It is excellently written, features a strong and likable heroine and perfectly captures her hopes and fears in an era so different to our own. It touches on a lot of issues – racial injustice, the situation of women at the beginning of the 20th century, poverty and family ties – and it does so in a very realistic way. It doesn’t look at things through rose-coloured glasses, and it certainly doesn’t offer an ending with a bow safely tied around all problems, but that is just the way I prefer endings with books like these. Life seldom offers cure-alls.At its core, though, this book is a book about women and the problems they faced, the restrictions imposed on them, the difficult decisions they had to make in order to fulfil their dreams and the consequences these decisions so often had. It follows Mattie, a sixteen-year-old girl dreaming of going to college in New York City and becoming a famous writer. Unfortunately, Mattie’s family situation doesn’t allow for dreams: Her mother died of cancer, her older brother has run away and her father has lost all his joy of living. Money is tight. Mattie is required to care for her younger sisters and help at the farm and expected to marry soon and become a farmer’s wife. Her father refuses to acknowledge the chances New York offers for her. Mattie is torn between wanting to be there for her family and wanting to make her dreams come true. Working at the Glenmore hotel gives her the chance to earn her tuition, but will she be able to leave everyone she loves behind?Told in alternating chapters – past and present merging towards the end (loved this style), A Gathering Light brilliantly captures the hopes and dreams of a young woman and the general feeling of the era and time. Mattie’s voice is spot on; the language is poetic but not overly so and evokes an overall feeling of nostalgia, of things ending, new ones beginning, of lost hopes and lost chances, with just the right amount of humour and lightness.The mystery revolving around a young woman drowning in the lake is not so much a mystery, but more so just the most important one of the many episodes Mattie encounters on her way that help her make her decision at the end.This book is not weighed down by an all-consuming love story, but I would have wished for the romance to be a bit more … romantic and for me to actually be involved in it. It is important to Mattie, but it was pretty clear for me as the reader that her choice would never make her happy – even if she wanted to believe otherwise. Random things I loved: Mattie’s word-of-the-day ritual and the ""word wars"" she fought with her friend Weaver, Cook the cook, Miss Wilcox’s library (so jealous) and the way the girls dealt with the guy from table six.Something I wanted to add: I've only read one other book by Jennifer Donnelly, Revolution, and it's amazing to see how different the two books are in voice. I loved both of them, but I really applaud Jennifer Donnelly for successfully capturing two heroines who are poles apart.",26,13
64481,A Northern Light,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,4,"September 13, 2010","An excellent YA novel. It didn't make me bawl my eyes out however, therefore only 4 stars. Set in 1906, the book follows an important period in a 16-year old girl's life, when she faces the dilemma of what her future will be. Mattie is an aspiring writer and yearns to attend university, but her family responsibilities hinder her dreams. Will she choose to risk it all and try to find her own independence or will she succumb to her family's wishes and abandon her aspirations to instead become a farmer's wife? A crime committed against a young woman might finally push Mattie to make this important choice. A Northern Light is an interesting blend of historical fiction, murder mystery, and commentary on sex, race, and social status at the beginning of the 20th century, but mainly this story is feminist at its core (but not in an ""in-your-face""/bra-burning way). Ultimately, A Northern Light is about how limited life choices for women were and how hard it was to assert independence. It presents an honest portrayal of the positions women occupied a century ago, the hardships of their lives, the limitations of their freedoms, and the price they had to pay to pursue their dreams.I would recommend this book to any reader looking for a quality YA story that doesn't involve vampires, fairies, TSTL heroines and abusive boyfriends.

64481,A Northern Light,Erin,"2,815",494,3,"April 27, 2017","3.5 stars. Hope Davis narrates audio book (8h 49m)Jennifer Donnelly's historical fiction/romance books for YA readers are always a real treat. Her female characters tend to be determined, strong-willed, and bookish. In ""A Northern Light"" we are taken into the rural life of one girl in 20th century America. Sixteen year old Mattie Gokey dreams of a life beyond her vacation resort town and the life of a writer in New York City. But Mattie 's widowed father, her little sisters, and her first love all question why Mattie wouldn't just be content to do her duty to her family. But as Mattie views different relationships between the women and men around her, she begins to question what type of path that she wants to choose for herself. It is also into this story that the body of a female guest at the hotel where Mattie works is found and this becomes one of the many threads of the book. This vein could have been explored much more quickly because it wasn't much of a mystery to me. Donnelly's strength is truly the characters in her stories. Coupled with the superb talents of Hope Davis on the audio, I felt that I ""knew"" each of these characters so very well and came to care for them in much the same way that Mattie did. Mattie, herself, is incredibly naive as a reader would expect from a girl in the early 1900's. Lastly, I really enjoyed the ""title "" dropping of dozens of books. Maybe, just maybe, we will eventually get a sequel.",21,2

Mattie drowning in responsibility and weighed down by her sense of duty and others' expectations. Weaver choking on prejudice and small mindedness. Emily fighting to break the surface of her own stifling marriage. Using the framework of the drowning of a young woman in 1906 Jennifer Donnelly gathers up the threads and images present in a poor close knit farming community in the Adirondacks and uses it like a loom to weave together a complex pattern in which oppression and repression intermingle with ambition and vision. The oppression of racism is addressed not just in terms of violent brutality or patronizing conversations but its knock on effect on dashed hopes and impoverished ambition. The tyranny of the powerful and influential where subservience, the norm in so many relationships whether marriage, employer/employee, tenant farmer and owner, results in dreams having to be curtailed. The gloom of the crippling effect of poverty which can lead to a hopelessness where your sense of self-worth disappears and anything goes if it will keep 'the wolf from the door' and then over-arching the whole novel, or perhaps underlying it as the unspoken ground of everything, is duty and responsibility. What can be expected of a person? what should be expected of a person? Promises made to the dying or the dead; how should these be fulfilled ? Do the needs and desires of others supersede your deepest hopes and dreams? When do childish imaginings stop being so and become reaonable ambitions and how can you tell ? Must you take the tapestry you have woven with care and talent and unpick its beauty simply because others tell you such a tapestry is a waste of thread and they declare your image of beauty to be mistaken and foolish.Mattie is a great character. Plain and poor but charged with her own special beauty and her own drive to speak out with her own voice. Words are her life; she loves them, she explores them. Each day she learns a new word and with Weaver,her friend, she plays a wonderfully simple game in which they do battle firing associated words back and forth. However it is the written words of the drowned girl, her love letters entrusted to Mattie, that prove the great catalyst for Mattie's inner struggle. As Mattie uncovers the tragic past of Grace it shines an inescapable light into her own future. There are an enormous number of plot strands here, perhaps slightly too many but they do, in the main, gel together and are all intertwined. Some of the characters seem less well drawn than others and some of the plot movements are contrived and awkward but it is an enthralling read. It is written for young adults and is another of those novels which i can see, in the hands of a clever teacher, could be a great leaping off point for all sorts of reflection and debate. Aside from that anyway it is just a good story and the fact that the tragic Grace, dead when the novel strarts, is a real-life character just adds to its sadness and effect.",18,6
64481,A Northern Light,Becky,"1,308",1595,4,"June 2, 2009","I love books about booklovers. I love the feeling of connection that I have with people who appreciate books and words the same way that I do. I felt this especially with Mattie, because she loves words and language and writing, but doesn't know exactly how to use those words... they are just built up inside her, preparing her for when she will be able to express herself. When I started this book, I wasn't sure if I would Love it (with a capital ""L"") as some of my friends here Loved it. It is very beautifully written, and the descriptions of Mattie's life are poetic, yet very bare and simple. About halfway through, I found myself turning the pages almost without realizing it. Somewhere along the line, I went from saying, ""Yes, this is a nice coming-of-age story"" to forgetting it was a story at all. And it is very nice to be sucked into a book like that. The characters are wonderfully real. Mattie is the awkward ""eldest"" child for all intents and purposes (which makes me think of certain unlucky eldest child and all her adventures chasing after a moving castle... but that's another story entirely), and is forced into a position of grudging submission to a promise she made her dying mother to stay and take care of her family. Doing this means denying the very essence of who Mattie is and all of her dreams and aspirations and goals. Weaver, I must say, is my favorite character. I loved him from the moment I met him out-wording Mattie in the field and getting to read The Count of Monte Cristo (one of the best books I've ever read) to her as a reward. I loved his courage, and his tenacity, and his spunk. I loved his linguistic kinship with Mattie, and that they were able to relate so well with each other. (To be perfectly honest, I hope that they actually end up together, and damn the social repercussions of their era! They are meant for each other.)Miss Wilcox is a headstrong, forward-thinking, women's rights activist in her own, special, very unappreciated way. She bolsters Mattie's love of writing and shows her how to be courageous in order to achieve her goal, even though Mattie doesn't realize that she's learned anything.Royal is the good-looking, business-minded, but selfish and hard-hearted farmer-to-be. I had hoped that he would maybe play a different hand, but alas, no happy endings here. I realize that I haven't even mentioned the mystery yet. To me, that was, surprisingly, the least important aspect of the story. True, that is what appealed to me most, thinking of the mysterious contents of a bundle of letters and the finger-pointing that they must surely contain. That aspect was interesting yes, I love true crime and I especially love dramatizations showing what most likely happened, but the real joy of this book was in the scenes between the dramatic lake-side mystery. Mattie and her family and her life. I have to say that she, and Weaver, touched me. This really was a lovely story. ",18,2
64481,A Northern Light,Paul,"1,143",1908,3,"January 11, 2014","This isn't my normal fare and I'm not entirely sure how it ended up on the bookshelf! However for bedtime reading I'm willing to try pretty much anything. This is a coming of age story set in early twentieth century America in New York state in a rural farming community. The author has quite neatly woven the story around an actual historical event; the murder of a young woman called Grace Brown (also the basis of Dreiser's An American Tragedy). The story revolves around Mattie, who is 16, her family and community. Mattie has aspirations to write and be educated and is held back by her responsibilities to her family since the death of her mother. She also has a boyfriend who only has aspirations to farm. She has a friend, Weaver, who also has aspirations to be a lawyer and he experiences the casual racism of society at the time. Mattie works at a local hotel over the summer to earn extra money, which is where she meets Grace Brown. The story is rather sweet, but is also formulaic; the heroic teacher, the older males in the book are a pretty grim lot, Mattie grumbles about happy endings in literature but the author delivers a predictable ending (not entirely ringing true). Many of the minor characters are a little flimsy. Mattie herself is endearing but rather predictable. I think overall, analysis of a book like this is pointless because the plot disintegrates under scrutiny, but it read easily and late at night my standards are less demanding and the author can get away with more!A sweet undemanding story which was ok despite my initial scepticism.",14,4
64481,A Northern Light,Scarlet,187,1145,5,"September 12, 2018","Halfway through A Gathering Light, I logged on to GoodReads wondering why I’d seemingly never heard of this absolutely riveting book, only to discover that I had. This is the UK title for A Northern Light - a book I’ve had on my TBR for years.A Gathering Light is the most feminist and empowering YA book I’ve read. I related to Mattie on a visceral level, to that need to be free of what everyone tells you is right, and the urge to go after what you know is right for you. I wish I had read this in my adolescence when I first realized the implications of gender roles in our society, particularly in my country - all those times I thought of impending adulthood with dread, because it seemed an inevitable and devastatingly straight road toward an avalanche of predefined roles I did not wish to embrace. I still sometimes struggle with this at 26, though I am much surer of myself as a person now and lucky enough to have met that rare creature called a “feminist man.”
  And I knew in my bones that Emily Dickinson wouldn't have written even one poem if she'd had two howling babies, a husband bent on jamming another one into her, a house to run, a garden to tend, three cows to milk, twenty chickens to feed, and four hired hands to cook for. I knew then why they didn't marry. Emily and Jane and Louisa. I knew and it scared me. I also knew what being lonely was and I didn't want to be lonely my whole life. I didn't want to give up on my words. I didn't want to choose one over the other.
Recommended to every teenage girl and young woman, or anyone who enjoys a good YA/historical fiction.",13,2
64481,A Northern Light,Sarah,477,26,1,"November 20, 2008","Disliked this book for three reasons:1. Mattie irritated me. She was supposed to be so smart but I thought she was stupid, I'd figured out the big 'mystery' by the second page but she was clueless until nearly the end.2. Weaver also annoyed me. I mean yes he was discriminated against and treated badly, blah blah, but I felt no pity for him because he so obviously pitied himself enough for both of us. His constant self-righteous rage made me want to smack him. 3. I thought the writer was projecting her own viewpoints (eg feminism, equal rights, being a stay-at-home-mum is a waste of intelligence, *real* literature is miserable and makes you depressed and the rest is just fluffy chick-lit) onto the characters instead of trying to think how someone in that period would feel. I hate it when writers give characters in historical fiction MODERN ideas and sensibilities. It's just lazy and incorrect.",13,2
64481,A Northern Light,Manybooks,"3,006",104,4,"November 27, 2022","Jennifer Donnelly's 2003 Carnegie Medal winning young adult novel A Gathering Light (which was originally published under the title of A Northern Light in the United States) is basically a historical fiction coming of age story (and also somewhat of a murder mystery). Set in 1906 and partially based on true events (the famous homicide of a pregnant Grace Brown by her faithless and callous lover), A Gathering Light first and foremost tells the story of sixteen-year-old Mattie Gokey throughout one summer, when while working at a posh hotel, Mattie is given a stack of letters to burn by one of the hotel guests, by Grace Brown (a day before Grace is found drowned, and the question in A Gathering Light of course is if her death was accidental or if Grace Brown had been the victim of foul play). And Mattie must after Grace's demise decide whether or not to read the letters she has been given or to simply burn them as Grace had originally requested of her (and read the letters she does, with Mattie Gokey soon discovering that Grace Brown had indeed been murdered). And with Mattie in A Gathering Light being fascinated by books and writing, desiring a post-secondary and also feeling weighed down by her familial responsibilities (as she has as the oldest daughter become the prime caregiver for her younger sisters after her mother's death), she is also torn between going to university and pursuing a romance with Royal Loomis (and indeed, whilst reading Grace's letters, Mattie realises not only that Grace's drowning has indeed not been an accidental death but callous murder but also that much of Grace's life kind of mirrors her own and that she, that Mattie should not consider continuing her romance with Royal, his charismatic and tempting seductiveness notwithstanding). Well, I absolutely love historical fiction and have from childhood (but only if it is good, of course), and I do find it really and wonderfully compelling how in A Gathering Light Jennifer Donnelly uses extracts from Grace Brown's actual and original letters. For albeit that aside from Grace, most of the other characters characters in A Gathering Light are entirely fictional and that A Gathering Light is of course first and foremost Mattie Gokey's first person and not Grace Brown's story, these letter extracts are extremely poignant and render A Gathering Light much more realistic and painful than if the murder mystery described were fictional and not in fact a crime that really did occur (or if it had only briefly been alluded to by Jennifer Donnelly in passing). Gloriously descriptive is A Gathering Light and with for me, both main protagonist and narrator Mattie and the Grace Brown we get to know from her letters being very likeable and kindred spirit like characters, that we feel for (and who we mourn for and feel indignant for once we learn that Grace's death was definitely not accidental), I really and truly enjoyed A Gathering Light, and with my only very mild and rather insignificant annoyance being that I kind of want Jennifer Donnelly to write a bit more about Grace, that for me, while the letters are definitely compelling, they do not give me a full enough picture and portrait.",11,N/A
