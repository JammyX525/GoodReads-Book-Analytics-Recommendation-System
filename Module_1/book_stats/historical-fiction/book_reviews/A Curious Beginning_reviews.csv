28186322,A Curious Beginning,Chelsea *Slowly Catching Up* Humphrey,"1,387",77200,5,"September 23, 2022","It is a rare day that I pick up historical fiction of any kind; I have nothing against the genre, but I feel as though all the flashy, contemporary books shove my good intentions out of the way and I never get around to reading those golden oldies I claim I'll dive into. Lucky for me, Berkley offered the opportunity to review all three books that currently make up the Veronica Speedwell series and am I glad they did. These books are amazing! I cannot believe it's taken me so long to read them, as they have come highly recommended time and again, but better late than never I suppose. If you, like me, shy away from books labeled as historical fiction, please don't overlook this exquisite book. Give me a chance to win you over, please?""I am quite determined to be mistress of my own fate, Mrs. Clutterthorpe, but I do sympathize with how strange it must sound to you. It is not your fault that you are entirely devoid of imagination. I blame your education.""So our heroine, Veronica Speedwell is a little firecracker; if people were to be related to animals then she would be the love child of a butterfly and a pit viper. She is a lady (almost) completely to the core, yet she is incredibly feisty and will strike out physically, or intellectually, if provoked. The first few chapters may seem a bit confusing and may cause you to wonder just what all these seemingly unrelated tangents could possibly have to do with each other, but I assure you that in time it all becomes clear. The fact that we are reading a mystery novel set in Victorian England, with a protagonist who is a progressive female with the determination to live her life on her terms gives this series a feel that bridges the gap of time. Here we have a nice blend of escaping to (and learning about) another time while also envisioning a world not so different from our own, one where women have to fight tooth and nail just to be considered of equal value to the opposite gender.He sat back in his chair, his mouth now slack with disbelief. ""I could smother you with that tea cozy and no one would blame me,"" he said in a voice thick with emotion.""Why ever should you want to?""""Because you daft, impossible woman, you have been concealing a possible motive from me for the whole of the time we have been together!""The witty banter between Mr. Stoker and Veronica isn't the only reason to love this series, but it sure does shoot to the very top of the list. Yes, these books have quite a few little shocking twists and exciting action scenes, but the developing relationship between these two characters are what makes this book a standout in a sea of other, similar books. I adore that we aren't given all the answers to Stoker's backstory in this installment, as well as seemingly not all the answers in Veronica's life as well. Just enough was provided to give us closure, but enough was left hanging to make me crave the next book. I was able to buddy read this alongside my sister Irina and we both were blown away by how taken we were with this book, so much so that she's grabbed the sequel from the library so that we can read it together as well! I mean, we have to know what happens next! Highly, HIGHLY recommended to those looking for a true Victorian mystery full of class, humor, and intrigue!Thanks Berkley Publishing for providing my copy!Buddy read with my sister Irina! <3",343,49
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Riley,422,20500,5,"December 4, 2021","after re-reading i think i have decided this is my all-time favorite book. it has everything I love- murder mystery- victorian london setting - rivals with the BEST banter - traveling circus- ""only one bed"" trope veronica and stoker are seriously two of my favorite characters ever. and their chemistry is unmatched ",198,3
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Robin (Bridge Four),"1,573",1462,4,"February 10, 2017","A lepidopterist and taxidermist run away and join the Circus….Wait what??? First I didn’t know what a lepidopterist was, it’s a person who studies butterflies and when I started this I think I internally groaned thinking that this was about a woman who loved to chase butterflies but lucky for me Veronica Speedwell is far more interesting than that. Veronica might not be the quintessential Victorian heroine. She is headstrong, opinionated and even has taken a lover or five in her time (she has very specific rules on this). Unlike the other women her age the last thing she wants is a husband or anyone else that will tell her what to do. When her last familial tie passes away she is ready to spread her wings with her new found freedom and start a new adventure in some foreign land. Little did she know that the adventure would find her right on the doorstep of the cottage she was just getting ready to leave. After a break-in where Veronica might have been a target or something nefarious she is met and semi-rescued by a nice gentleman claiming to know her parents and adamant that she is in great danger. It isn’t that Veronica necessarily believes him but she is always up for a good adventure and London is as good a place to start as any. When a murder happens Veronica seems to be in the middle of a mystery and wants to find out why so many unusual things seem to be centered around her.Left in the care of the ruggedly handsome Stoker with an even more mysterious past Veronica sets out to try and figure out what any of this has to do with her and the parents she never knew. The banter between Stoker and Veronica was perhaps my favorite part of the book. He has never met a woman quite like her and the chemistry between them is definitely of the slow smolder variety. On the run and in hiding they end up in some peculiar places including a traveling circus of sorts. While Stoker might think he is dragging her along make no mistake Veronica does not go where she doesn’t want to be.
   I had just returned to the caravan and resumed adventuring with Arcadia Brown when Mr. Stoker burst in, soaking wet and covered in a soapy lather. His hair was dripping rivulets onto the floor, and he had wrapped a bath sheet about himself like a toga. He loomed over me, drenched and panting, having obviously run all the way from the bath tent. “You look like one of the less capable Roman emperors,” I observed. “Go back and finish the job properly.”“I have a crow to pluck with you. It just occurred to me – “ “It just occurred to you that I was at liberty and might make my escape. Yes, I know. You are a wretched abductor, Mr. Stoker. I suggest you do not take up felonious activity as a career.”His expression was sullen. “You will have to make allowances. It is, after all, my first abduction.”
 I was a little sad to find out that this wasn’t a standalone novel as I really wanted a resolution to the building desire that was clearly between Stoker and Veronica. As they traipse around London discovering what in Veronica’s lineage could have led to so many chasing after them and be so dangerous I grew to love the idea of them together. The mystery of this was okay. I was really more interested in the dynamics between Stoker and Veronica and all the shenanigans they seemed to get into together more than an actual resolution to the mystery. Also I did get tired of always being reminded that Veronica was a strange woman. It was made clear time and time again that she is slightly odd, a little overly logical and peculiar in her fascinations. She is still pretty likable I just didn’t need any extra reminders. She reminded me a little of Dr. Bones from Bones the TV series, if she would have been in Victorian London.I will definitely continue on with the series since I enjoyed the Nancy Drewness of the story and I’m thoroughly intrigued by not only Stoker’s past but also by the chemistry between the two characters. It was fun following them through this first escapade and I can see them getting into all kinds of trouble in the future.",162,11
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Jaclyn,780,167,2,"August 23, 2015","A Curious Beginning is the launch of Raybourn’s newest series featuring amateur sleuth, adventuress, lepidopterist, and lover of foreign men, Miss Veronica Speedwell. Veronica has just buried her spinster aunt, her last living guardian, and she’s ready for another adventure. However, this adventure is much closer to home than she could have anticipated. Arriving home from her aunt’s funeral she surprises a burglar and hitches a ride to London with a German baron that claims to have known her mother and father, both of whom Veronica has no remembrance of.Once in London, her self-appointed guardian stashes Veronica with a trusted ally, Stoker. Stoker is none to happy to have Veronica as a guest; he is not impressed with her opinions on his collection, but he nonetheless complies. When the baron is murdered, Veronica and Stoker are suddenly on the run. Stoker is the prime suspect and doesn’t quite trust the fact that Veronica wasn’t complicit in the murder of his friend. And well, Veronica, she's not one to turn down an adventure.What should have been an amazing read ended up being a bit lackluster for me. Veronica should have been an intriguing heroine; however, her quirkiness ended up coming across as a caricature rather than something authentic. While Veronica's originally was intriguing and refreshing for a Victorian mystery, I have to confess to finding somewhat over-the-top by the end of the book.I had been an obstinate child and a willful one too, and it did not escape me that it had cost these two spinster ladies a great deal of adjustment to make a place for me in their lives. It was for this reason, as I grew older, that I made every effort to curb my obstinacy and be cheerful and placid with them. And it was for this reason that I eventually made my escape, fleeing England whenever possible for tropical climes where I could indulge my passion for lepidoptery. It was not until my first butterflying expedition at the age of eighteen – a monthlong sojourn in Switzerland – that I discovered men could be just as interesting as moths.Initially, Veronica is a wholly unique and adventurous young woman. However, Veronica’s individuality quickly ventured into pure artifice. Veronica’s character was so unique that it became unrealistic and less entertaining. The idea behind Veronica was great, but for me, the execution of such a character was lacking. I didn't need to be told over and over again that Veronica was a different kind of woman.As for readers of the mystery genre, I have to say I think you’ll likely be disappointed by A Curious Beginning. This one is all snappy dialogue and not much substance. The dialogue between Stoker and Veronica is fantastic:I had just returned to the caravan and resumed adventuring with Arcadia Brown when Mr. Stoker burst in, soaking wet and covered in a soapy lather. His hair was dripping rivulets onto the floor, and he had wrapped a bath sheet about himself like a toga. He loomed over me, drenched and panting, having obviously run all the way from the bath tent. “You look like one of the less capable Roman emperors,” I observed. “Go back and finish the job properly.” “I have a crow to pluck with you. It just occurred to me – “ “It just occurred to you that I was at liberty and might make my escape. Yes, I know. You are a wretched abductor, Mr. Stoker. I suggest you do not take up felonious activity as a career.” His expression was sullen. “You will have to make allowances. It is, after all, my first abduction.” However, snappy one-liners and witty repartee does not compensate for the lackluster mystery. Stoker and Veronica never really do any investigating. Instead they run off to the circus and say witty things to one another. A small part of A Curious Beginning was actually devoted to who killed the German baron who helped Veronica. And the discovery of Veronica’s parentage just didn’t seem as impactful as it should have been. As mysteries go, this one was very light.So, A Curious Beginning didn’t particularly impress me. That said, the back-and-forth between Veronica and Stoker was entertaining and that alone would make me consider reading the next book in the series, although I will be hoping for a stronger mystery and not side adventures where our hero and heroine seem to forget all about the murder they just might be imprisoned for.Originally reviewed at The Book Adventures. *Review copy provided by the publisher via Edelweiss.",114,10

No. I couldn't stop thinking about these characters. So I read it again almost immediately and fell head first in love. I adore Veronica and Stoker. It took a reread for me to completely attach to them and fully understand them. Their my new obsession. I don't find OTP's often but they are fitting the bill.January 2022: 3.5⭐HEAR ME OUT! I’m giving this a 3.5 for now cause at first I said “this was pretty good” and thought that was it. Then when listening to another audiobook, I kept thinking about this one. So ima frugally going to reread this book immediately and see what happens. It feels like a tv show where the first few episodes just get me into the world and I haven’t fallen in love with the characters yet. Hopefully upon reread I will enjoy it so much more 🤞🤞",110,2
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Julie ,"3,989",58900,5,"September 18, 2015","A Curious Beginning by Deanna Raybourn is a 2015 NAL/Penguin publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. I don't know how she does it! This first book in the new Veronica Speedwell mysteries gets off to a rip roaring start! I absolutely loved it! Veronica has lived an extraordinary life for a young lady raised in the 1800's. Taken in by her two aunts after being orphaned, Veronica has been shuffled around often, but this has worked to her advantage, giving her a view of the world most young women of her time never got to see. As an expert butterfly hunter, Lepidopterology being her specialty, Veronica has seen many places, gone on exciting adventures, and embarked upon passionate love affairs. Now that her both of her aunts have passed away, Veronica intends to continue pursuing the things she loves most in the world, but her plans are immediately thwarted when the Baron von Stauffenbach arrives on Veronica's doorstep just in time to chase away a house-breaker. The Baron claims to know something of Veronica's heritage, but also warns that she is in grave danger and must come away with him at once. Seeing a chance to travel to London without paying for a ticket, Veronica agrees to hitch a ride with the Baron. On their journey the Baron convinces Veronica to stay with an old friend of his, a man he refers to as “Stoker, whom he trust completely, until he feels Veronica is safe again. From the moment Stoker and Veronica meet, life will never be the same for either of them. Stoker will find himself drawn into Veronica's dangerous situation, and in a way he never dreamed possible. Deanna Rayborn is a favorite author of mine, so I super excited about getting to read this one, but I also felt just a twinge of trepidation. Having loved the 'Lady Julia” series so much, a change of pace can go one of two ways, but I am happy to report I loved this book every bit as much as I loved the 'Julia' series and I can not wait to read the next installment! I don't know which character was the most outrageous, Veronica or Stoker. Both were outstanding characters, very odd, unique, clever, and funny. I will lay odds that every person who reads this book will absolutely adore Veronica. She is so forthcoming, smart, and honest, yet, she has a way of cushioning her observations so that the truth doesn't hurt too terribly bad. Stoker, is a man of mystery, a taxidermist, and a carnival act, but one gets the distinct impression that the man is living beneath his original station in life. He's grumpy, gripes, is suspicious, but like the Baron promised, is honorable. Be warned that Stoker is a very complex character and you will not solve the mystery of who he really is or garner all the details of his tumultuous life. Stoker is a tough nut to crack, but in time, I do believe Veronica will draw out all of his secrets. While it may not seem like things are going to fare so well between Veronica and Stoker,in the beginning, what with the two of them holding back secrets and pertinent information from one another, not to mention the awkward position they find themselves in, but in the end they wound up working together very well, and made an excellent detective team. The mystery stays a mystery for a long time as the author drops clues, plot twist, and red herrings around at a pace that only adds to the suspense. It's obvious Veronica is in grave danger, but she insist there is nothing at all interesting about her and can't seem to understand what all the fuss is about. I will admit to becoming impatient a time or two as information about the case trickled in a snails pace, but Veronica and Stoker kept me highly entertained while I cooled my heels. But, when all the pieces of the puzzle begin to click into place, the mystery takes on very serious and far reaching ramifications. The intrigue Veronica finds herself in the midst of isn't merely dangerous, but shocking and explosive. I was riveted, tightly holding onto my kindle with both hands, barely even breathing! To say I enjoyed this book goes without saying. It's smart-witted, amusing, with near perfect characterization, sharp and snappy dialogue, with a very compelling and interesting plot. I highly recommend this book to all mystery lovers and to those who enjoy historical fiction. 5 stars",96,20
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Linda,"1,166",1213,4,"January 12, 2018","""I have little doubt your bark is worse than your bite,"" he retorted.""How do you know, Mr. Stoker? I haven't bittten you yet.""And there's quite the bite in this one. Teeth-sinking......gonna-leave-a-mark kind of bite.Veronica Speedwell has been raised from early childhood by two spinster aunts in London. 1887 brings the last chapter to that relationship as Veronica returns to close up the small cottage after their deaths. Walking through the rooms she recalls the memories. Such confined quarters were the springboard to propel her into more wordly adventures. Her professional butterfly net leans against the wall as a testament to both her natural science pursuits and those of various romantic flirtations.Just as Veronica is making her way out the door, she is accosted by a sizeable man who roughly pulls her down to the ground. She fights him off until her cries for help are met by a German baron who chases away the abductor. Baron von Stauffenbach tells her to grab her bag. Veronica is in much danger and they must flee immediately. With no time to even question the baron, they climb into his carriage. The baron brings her to the small home of Mr. Stoker, a natural scientist, who is working on a huge elephant specimen. Stoker is reminded of his debts to the baron and a deal is cut in which Stoker will keep an eye on Veronica until the baron can return. He tells Stoker that he will explain everything later. But later never comes for the baron. When the baron's body is found, Stoker and Veronica know that they must take to the road and find a place of safety. It is this game of hide and seek that brings the plot to a fine boil. Who is pursuing Veronica and why?Deanna Raybourn spices up this storyline with a pistol of a main female character. Her feisty nature floats right on the story's surface and her witty comebacks are not lost on the readers. She's experienced quite a bit during her wordly travels much to the dismay of Stoker. Smart and analytical, she's quite the challenging figure. This is the first book in the Veronica Speedwell series and it lights the fire well for the upcoming books. There is a very creative ""twisty"" at the end of the book that is worth the price of admission. I'm looking forward to the next one in the series. I'm sure Veronica will be smiling a toothy grin like the Cheshire cat in all these future offerings by Raybourn.",80,11
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Magdalena aka A Bookaholic Swede,"1,910",763,4,"February 10, 2017","I did enjoy the book very much for the most parts. It was entertaining, funny to read sometimes and I really wanted to know what was so special about Veronica. One thing I thought about when I read the book was that even though I liked Veronica, she just didn't seem to suit the century. I mean this is the year 1887, not 1987. She is freely talking about sex, she had several dallies, she even asks Stoker when the last time he had sex and she seems so liberated in a period when women absolutely weren't that liberated, well not without losing their reputations. I still like her, she is a marvelous character, sure sometimes she was borderline annoying and a bit know-it-all. But still, she is great, loves her freethinking way even though it goes against everything I know about the period.The one part of the story that I found dragged down the story a bit was the circus part. Stoker and Veronica have run away after the barons murder and is hiding in a circus and I just felt that it took far to much of the story and that it just didn't feel that relevant. This was more a get to know Stoker's background. And, the whole thing with them pretending to be married was kind of amusing, but mostly I just wanted the story to get moving towards more about veronica and why there seem to be people after her.But after that, the story took off again and I loved the part where we got to know more about her family. That was a very gutsy twist to the story! I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this series when it is released.I received this copy from NAL through Edelweiss in return for an honest review! Thank you!",65,8
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Beverly,773,266,3,"March 2, 2018","It is strange that I read this one after A Murder in Time, because the heroine in this story is smart, disciplined, and a modern thinking woman of the 1800s, where as the actual modern day woman who traveled back in time to the 1800s did not seem to be terribly smart or self-disciplined. She was unable to stop flinging epithets about, not even to protect herself from exposure. I liked this heroine more and admired her fortitude under extremely trying circumstances. It makes me consider A Murder in Time to be more of a 2 rating than a 3.",59,14
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Emily,181,7,1,"January 22, 2019","In an attempt to be organized:What I liked: ...What I disliked: Characters. Plot. Dialogue Revelations. Let me start with Veronica Speedwell, our main character and narrator. In the first 9 pages, we find that what she calls being ""blunt"" is really the rudest and most offensive way to say what's on her mind. There are many ways to say, 'no, I won't marry their father whom I don't know and become the mother to his six children' that isn't ""'Mrs. Clutterthorpe, I can hardly think of any fate worse than becoming the mother of six. Unless perhaps it were the plague, and even then I am persuaded a few disfiguring buboes and possible death would be preferable to motherhood.'"" Followed by other insults disguised as ""bluntly honest."" A fine introduction to the narrator of this entire book.Now, the idea of this book is that the last connection Miss Speedwell has to England, her Aunt who is not at all related to her, has died and she is about to go abroad to catch butterflies since she is a Lepidopterist and Scientist. However, her trip is aborted when, to quote the dust jacket summary of this book, she ""thwarts her own abduction"" and meets a mysterious older German gentleman who claims to have known her mother. This German gentleman leaves her with a surly taxidermist, promising to come back and reveal Speedwell's parentage, but is murdered. The rest of the book is Speedwell and the taxidermist, Stoker, trying to unravel the murder and how it's related to Miss Speedwell. I must say though, Veronica Speedwell does NOT thwart her own abduction. The German gentleman, Baron Maximilian von Stauffenbach, does. In fact, Veronica nearly ASSISTS her own abduction by rushing into her obviously broken-into cottage to confront the person who is still in the house! And upon finding the person and realizing he is huge, admitting that she underestimated her opponent (she couldn't even see him! how could she even make an estimate of this person?!). But then she  runs after him  and confronts him. He grabs her arm and it's only when Maximilian holds up a revolver to the person...so, that's in the first 15 pages.And what does our lovely, kind, well-mannered narrator do upon meeting a taciturn taxidermist by the name of Stoker? She spends most of the page trying to one-up him (he mockingly offers her a cigar, she declines, saying his are inferior tobacco and pulls our her own cigarollo), point out his mistakes (pointing out a label mistake on butterfly, literally one of the first things out of her mouth), and educate him on how to get expeditions. It's really condescending, and she seems to think that she's being compassionate and helpful. ""'I suppose it was expected that you would lose your nerve.'"" SO KIND. Reading though this part was excruciating. It took me HOURS to go 30 pages. And she's found her second opportunity to talk about her sex life. It's great and all that she doesn't live by the rigid morality of the time, but when she spends a good bit of time explaining why she doesn't ever enter onto an affair with an Englishman because it's on native soil and rumor could get out and society isn't forgiving, it makes me side-eye each time she spills about her sexcapades. Its amounts to the same thing she's trying to avoid! Not to mention she supposedly doesn't care about society or what they think of her!Quick side note: Veronica Speedwell is Unconventional, Unfeminine, Odd, Peculiar, Unique, Astonishing, Intelligent, a Scientist, a Lepidopterist, Eccentric, Self-Taught, Intellectually Free, Shocking, Original, Unusual, etc. These are important traits in her. She's Been Around The World on expeditions and had several Lighthearted Affairs (I really don't care that she has, its just her whole attitude about it is contradictory to her rules! And she likes to throw them in people's faces). One of these affairs may or may not have been with a Corsican Bandit that attempted to either marry or murder her, and taught her to defend herself. He's mentioned no less than FIVE times. He must be a favorite. (I have formed two lists for her while reading. The ""OF COURSE she is"" list and the ""List of Adjectives"")There's also the whole bit where Speedwell says ""'We are, as a gender, undereducated and infantilized to the point of idiocy.'"" On the next page she says, ""The men there were not half so tiresome as the ladies who arrange the flowers'"". WHY spout feminist arguments only to go and side against the rest of your gender? Ugh.Moving on the Stoker, the taxidermist. Also the expeditionist. And natural historian. And gentleman. And reader of romantic poetry, tattooed, eyepatch-ed, scarred by a jaguar, navy surgeon, conjurer, and knife thrower. I can refer to him by many titles, and still be only referring to him. His full name is Revelstoke Templeton-Vane. And he is full of revelations. I forget how old he is, but no more than 32. Yet has been in a traveling show 3x, once in his childhood, which is weird as he is born into a gentleman's family. And for the first half of this novel, I was convinced that he was some unformed, unfinished foil of a character existing only to heighten Veronica's intelligence by the reader's estimation. I think he was better fleshed out by the end. I think. (I formed a list for Stoker too. The ""Of Course he is/did"" list)And any other character in this book is either: a two-dimensional stock character (the jealous dancer from the traveling show) or falls under Veronica's supposed charm. And they all feel like Stoker did at first, meaning that they exist to accentuate Veronica's intelligence. Sometimes Stoker's as well. I think I've covered characters. Moving on: Plot. It dragged for about 150 pages or so. There was no advancement in trying to figure out the cause and the murderer behind the murdered German baron. Just pages and pages of Stoker and Veronica bickering, one-upping, etc. And a traveling show. Just because. Dialogue Revelations. This is not something that I talk about in every book. I've actually not encountered it before at all. And I truly dislike it. I cannot be convinced that saving character revelations or the process of deductive reasoning being reserved for dialogue only is a way to make the characters smart. So many revelations that are thrust upon readers happen not during Veronica's internal narrative, but when she is talking aloud. Same with Stoker. Like that Veronica had malaria. We don't find out until Stoker confronts her (in dialogue, of course). Or how Veronica knew that Stoker actually came from an aristocratic family--his boots and vowel pronunciation. Or Veronica witnessed Krakatoa (Of Course she did). Or her parentage, which is all written in documents. The author could have chosen to have Veronica see it upon the page and SHARE that part with readers, but instead we know Veronica reads it and its shocking, but we don't know WHO or WHAT until she hands it to Stoker so he can read ALOUD (see: dialogue). All revealed in dialogue. It's kind of annoying, and it feels like a cheap device to amplify shock value and/or prolong suspense and anticipation. Speaking of both plots and dialogue revelations, Stoker and Veronica spend a good deal of time trying to discern motives for the murder of the baron. And so much time has been spent trying to establish that the characters are Intelligent that it just seems absurd that they cannot see the obvious link between the murder of the baron and Veronica. I'm convinced this is also a device to try and make the plot last longer. (And Veronica spends an embarrassingly long time denying that she is related to the whole affair despite her Intellectual Prowess. Her reasoning in the end? Miss World Traveler Scientist Lepidopterist Astonishingly Unfeminine Unconventional Unusual Speedwell thinks herself Not Very Interesting. <--- WTF I CANNOT HANDLE THIS)I do not know if I covered everything that bothers me about this book. It's hard to say because I couldn't keep track. I can say, though, that the ending was extremely fitting for this rather extreme book. Is that a plus? I don't know. BTW, name-dropping does not convince me that a character is smart. Using a feminist argument that is modern in today's world for a character in 1887 London does not convince me a character is smart. Having a character admit to being abducted numerous times and is still alive and unharmed does not convince me a character is smart. My favorite part: ""He shook his head as if to clear it. 'I smoked opium once. It felt like listening to you...'"" He's referring to Veronica.",58,8

  incoherent stream of thoughts & feelings
- this book follows our free-spirited, know-it-all, opinionated, main character, Veronica Speedwell, a lepidopterist by trade (thats just a fancy name for someone who studies/collects butterflies) who finds her safety in danger after the passing of her aunt- she is teamed up with a grumpy, unkempt taxidermist due to unforeseen circumstances and now they're working to solve some mystery- and oH MY GOD YOU GUYS, THEY ARE THE PERFECT PAIR- they're so snarky with each other, they bicker endlessly and get on each other's nerves but at the same times they build this comradery and friendship and it's so sweeeeeettttt aaaaaaaaaaa- and ok the chemistry between the two of them is so GOOD. it's slow burn but x 32193 and it just makes it so much better jfkljdalfkjal (but i'm also annoyed bc i want them TO BE TOGETHER) 
  ""...Perhaps some tidying up would be in order."" I suggested hopefully, regarding the chaos of his surroundings.""Touch so much as a hair of a sloth's head, and I will have you shot,"" he said darkly. 
ugh their banter really is just top tier- theyre like audrey and thomas from Stalking Jack the Ripper but older, more mature, and grumpier, it's fantastic - they literally join the circus like,,,,,,excuse me this calls to my inner clown- theyre so soft with each other like if the other one gets hurt (which happens more often than not) they're always freaking out and rushing to help and losing their mind bc THEYRE SO IN LOVE BUT THEYRE BOTH BLIND- like Stoker is an absolute grump but when he's with her, he's less of a grump and you know what, that's true love right freaking there heart emoji heart emoji- ok i've gone on about the romance far too much for a book that barely features any- so the mystery aspect isn't the greatest, probably because the main focus of the book is veronica herself - (or thats what it seemed like to me) but it is very entertaining to read and it was set up and delivered well.- the plot itself is quite slow and things take time to progress, BUT the main reveal did make me raise my eyebrows in shock !! (amazing)- BUT I JUST LOVE THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND ARCS SO MUCH I WOULD READ THE BOOK JUST FOR THEM- there is so much more background to learn about these characters, it seems everyone is harbouring some secrets and basically i'm going to throw myself into the next book as soon as possible- so if you like victorian detectives, character centered, and a slowburn romance, and clownery, sign right up4.5 stars",58,19

I literally knew nothing about this before going into it, but it was a lot of fun. The story was a little all over the place, but I really liked the main character, Veronica. I look forward to reading the next book in the series!",56,1 comment

  ”But those of us who have been given the benefit of learning and useful occupation, well, we are the proof that the traditional notions of feminine delicacy and helplessness are the purest poppycock.”
 Veronica Speedwell, Victorian lady and globetrotting lepidopterist extraordinaire. Her wit, her sass, her quirkiness, her own original brand of early feminism, I loved each and every page in her company.London, 1887Just back in England due to the loss of her only remaining adoptive aunt, Veronica is already planning her next scientific expedition to continue studying exotic butterflies and enjoy the occasional romantic affair around the world when a ransacked house and an attempted abduction force her to prolong her homecoming. With the help of an elderly German baron who strangely seems to know many things about her unknown origins as an orphan as well as about who might be trying to harm her, Veronica repairs to London and, urged by the foreign aristocrat, accepts the protection and the unenthusiastic hospitality of the only man the baron trusts with her life.Reclusive, enigmatic and grouchy as much as handsome, Stoker would like nothing more than to go on with his work as a natural historian and taxidermist without pesky external interferences though, bound by a debt of honour, he has no choice save for accepting the meddling, and maddening, bluestocking into his care. But when, few days later, the baron is found murdered before he was given the opportunity to reveal what he knew about Veronica’s past, it’s clear someone would go to great lengths in order to silence all of them forever. And so the eccentric spinster and the solitary fallen gentleman must join forces, ignore the most inopportune attraction developing between them and embark on a wild run to escape the clutches of the faceless and ruthless enemies chasing their every step... Narrated by Veronica’s smart, unconventional and unique voice, A Curious Beginning is a delightful blend of mystery and adventure, the pace and the breeziness catering to a more contemporary taste while the rich, polished style and the vivid and atmospheric setting evocative of Victorian suspense novels of yore. Peppered with intelligent humour all along, the author takes us on a fun ride and introduces us to a very likeable and layered leading duo. I found their amusing bickering alone worth the ticket and despite the romance remaining in the background, there is a delicious tension between these two punctuated by a sparkling banter which makes the chemistry even more palpable, so much that they quite don’t go a chapter ”without a feisty discussion and a pitched battle of wits.” They both have recognised a similar inquisitive, free-thinking and independent mind in each other, and if she’s the more provocative and flamboyant of the two while he harbours a well-hidden emotional side, they can’t help but feel strong, and reluctant, mutual admiration and attraction, a simmering push and pull that promises some nice fireworks for the rest of their ongoing romance throughout the series.The main mystery plotline is carefully built, slowly composing the bigger picture, giving more immediate answers and leaving loose threads for future developments at the same time. But for me, what really shines is the exuberant and refined writing, the tongue-in-cheek light tone allowing nonetheless multifaceted characterisations and storytelling.An exciting and wonderful series to look forward to.Buddy-read with Jill :)",54,15
28186322,A Curious Beginning,Jacob Proffitt,"2,849",1490,5,"June 6, 2021","What an unexpected delight! Veronica has a very strong voice and it comes out strong right from the beginning. Veronica is brash, intelligent, and driven and she engaged me from the start. I was happy to find that her confidence and straight-forwardness never wavered, even when she was was at her lowest. And my favorite was how little time or anxiety she spent worrying about Stoker or catering to his tantrums—and how refreshing he found that treatment.Indeed, the back and forth with Stoker was a highlight and I found myself laughing out loud at many of their exchanges. And I liked that Stoker could hold his own with her without feeling a need to diminish her in any way. They made a great partnership, frankly, and seeing them combine their respective talents to take on all comers, however powerful, was extremely fun.And anything else I have to say would be spoilerific, so I'll just say that some of the plot twists were twisty indeed, and I loved the chance that Raybourn took with her inventive history and how, for all I know, yeah, something like this might very well have happened and the historical figures involved could very well have behaved as depicted at that time and place.So this gets all the stars and I was very happy to have found it.A note about Chaste: While Veronica has sexual exploits in her past, she does not believe in liaisons with Englishmen and sticks to that determination despite having to acknowledge an attraction to Stoker. We've no idea what Stoker thinks about that, but I love how her frank talk disconcerted him a time or two. So this is chaste, but there is talk of sex, just not in much detail. That may not be considered ""chaste"" to many, but it works for me.",53,4

A sparky relationship develops between them as they are chased across the country by various rogues and scoundrels. Looking forward to the next instalment. Recommended.,49,2
