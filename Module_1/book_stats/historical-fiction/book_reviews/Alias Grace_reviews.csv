72579,Alias Grace,Annet,570,710,5,"September 12, 2019","Sometimes I whisper it over to myself: Murderess, Murderess. It rustles, like a taffeta skirt along the floor... Highlight of 2017 for me!A pure gem. That is Alias Grace, for me. Another grand work of Margaret Atwood. Atwood, described as ‘one of the most brilliant and unpredictable novelists alive’ (Literary Review)……and also: ‘A witty, elegant, generous and patient writer.’ I would say a strong-minded, self-willed, wayward writer, sometimes also dark and ruthless. This story keeps you hooked from beginning to end, following Grace Marks in her troubled life. A colourful, multifaceted and intriguing story, that keeps you reading for more than 500 pages…. This is how Atwood describes the story outline in her Author’s Afterword, which I recommend everyone to read in full: About Grace is a work of fiction, although it is based on reality. Its central figure, Grace Marks, was one of the most notorious Canadian women of the 1840s, having been convicted of murder at the age of sixteen. The Kinnear-Montgomery murders took place on July 23, 1843, and were extensively reported not only in Canadian newspapers but in those of the United States and Britain. The details were sensational: Grace Marks was uncommonly pretty and also extremely young. Nancy Montgomery had previously given birth to an illegitimate child and was Thomas Kinnear’s mistress; at her autopsy she was found to be pregnant. Grace and her fellow servant James McDermott had run away to the US together and were assumed by the press to be lovers…..The trial was held in early November. Only the Kinnear murder was tried. …. McDermott was hanged in front of a huge crowd on November 21, but opinion about Grace was divided from the start and due to the efforts of her lawyer and a group of respectable gentlemen petitioners –who pleaded her youth, the weakness of her sex and her supposed witlessness her sentence was commuted to life…. She continued to be written about over the course of the century, and she continued to polarize opinion. Attitudes towards her reflected contemporary ambiguity about the nature of women: was Grace a female fiend and temptress, the instigator of the crime and the real murderer of Nancy Montgomory, or was she an unwilling victim, forced to keep silent by McDermott’s threats and by fear of her own life? ….So this story takes you in more than 500 pages in a quiet pace through the life of Grace… and a variety of characters surround her in the progress of the story. Including the fascinating Dr. Jordan, who comes into play to assess Grace and in that process we witness his struggle and moral decline….As Atwood says in her afterword: she stayed with the historical facts, but there were gaps there or unclarities/various versions and in that case she took the liberty to fill those gaps in. What can I say. I think Atwood is a true artist – solid writing – sharp observations – great writing. What more can I want? 5 stars and highly recommended. I'm a fan (was already, now it's official :-))",299,70
72579,Alias Grace,Kalliope,681,22,5,"December 17, 2015","Working with patches. Patchwork. Putting together various pieces of material that already existed and joining them into a new design.This is the theme that Margaret Atwood has developed through her novel, and I am not making this up for the sake of my review. Her concluding paragraphs, spoken by her heroine, are about the patched Tree of Paradise.
  The Tree itself is of triangles, in two colours, dark for the leaves and a lighter colour for the fruits; I am using purple for the leaves and red for the fruits.
And so Atwood constructed her fiction. She has taken fragments from a past reality, from a crime committed in the Canada of the 1840s. The unifying thread is the fictionalized account of Grace Marks, one of the two people convicted for a double murder. The other person accused was hanged, but her sentence was commuted to life in prison. Through her novel Atwood has called her to live again--in fiction. Thanks to her stitches.Using this textual thread, one spun out of the materials of memory and invention, Atwood has joined many other pieces. Some add colour and veracity, for she includes fragments from newspapers – for as this became a famous case, a plethora of texts narrated this event before Atwood did – as well as extracts from the written confessions by Marks herself, or from letters written by real life figures such as the Medical Superintendent of the Asylum where Marks was interned, or from the Diary of the Warden of the Penitentiary where Marks spent the early part of her sentence. Other fragments included add a different tonality and ingenuity. Stanzas from poems, sonnets, stanzas and tragedies interspersed here and there add insight and sensitivity. This crafty use of lyrical and dramatic elements appeal to our fancies and sharpen our awareness, and the overall effect is new and compelling.And as we notice Atwood’s abilities in working with patches, we recognized her literary artistry and her understanding of the powers of fiction. When stories are woven they are nothing at all, but when they are finished, with all their parts sewn together, they become what they are. Not surprisingly is Scheherezade invoked in the novel. For stories, mixing truths and falsities acquire the nature of something else. They are not too different from the Tree of Paradise, the tree of Life and of Good&Evil.",284,49
72579,Alias Grace,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,3,"June 6, 2011","I felt about Alias Grace the same way I did about probably half of Atwood's novels I've read so far - I just didn't fully get it. Nobody conveys Life ain't easy for a woman message as well as Atwood. Past, present, future - the living is rough for women. It is particularly unpleasant for Grace Marks, a young servant girl in mid-19th century Canada, accused of murdering her employer and his housekeeper with the help of her co-worker and alleged paramour, and who is locked up first in an insane asylum and then prison. Atwood finds a way to explore plenty of issues from a feminist standpoint here - poverty, servitude, sexual repression, violence, insanity - and does is marvelously.What didn't work for me was Grace's story itself. Evidently, this real-life criminal case got a lot of attention back in a day. Was Grace a cunning murderess? Or did her supposed lover force her to participate in this gruesome crime? Did she make up her convenient memory loss? People speculated about this 150 years ago without coming to any definitive conclusion. Atwood doesn't give any answers in her fictionalized version either. After establishing Grace's character so well, the author failed in my eyes to come up with a convincing solution to the mystery, or a believable motivation for either scenario. If Grace was in fact the evil murderess, why did she desire to kill her master? And if her co-conspirator was in charge, what was his reason? I never understood this.I appreciate ambiguity on fiction, but what is the point of reconstructing a crime, examining it if you do not give any opinion as to what actually took place? Frustrating.",191,17
72579,Alias Grace,Fabian,933,1525,5,"April 23, 2020","I keep kicking myself for having ditched the Atwood Speaking Gala at A.W.P. in Chicago this year (2012). The fierce literati kept the attendance so high that it was virtually as if Lady Gaga herself were to give a lecture on her impressive body of work. I was more interested in walking all around Chitown, anyway, but I really (sorta) regret not having nabbed a coveted seat. She was probably amazing: uberclever & brilliant.Without two minor (teeny) infractions, “Alias Grace” is pretty much a well-rounded, totalizing, COMPLETE novel—one which paints a full world with such realistic colors that the reader quickly forgets that the plot actually comes from the 1850’s Annals of Canadian Crime. Before I start extolling it madly, let me quickly state what those two “minor infractions” are: Grace’s 1st-person accounts are not completely authentic-sounding; they are far too articulate and intelligent—symbols become too clearly presented to the reader (who should feel slightly MORE confused, as psyches are often deep chasms) as the author’s own signature is made overly-clear in Grace’s own declarations (Atwood adds on her character’s openly-questionable credibility pretty early on, to her credit). Also, there is this feeling that without that added spice of changing POV’s and tenses, the plot would have been banal & tedious—the middle indeed sags, but the conclusion, the last 80 pages of it, is ultimately positively stellar. Luckily for us, the writer was hyperaware of how much of her own added element would befit this seemingly-simple story of homicide. Those symbols of femininity (the red peonies, the patchwork quilt, the washing & scrap-booking) have never been placed in such intense context before—I was genuinely enthralled, impressed like a rabid Atwood fanboy. I truly like this one, perhaps not as much as her fantastic “Oryx and Crake,” but far more than her most famous “Handmaid’s Tale” & her more recent “Year of the Flood.”",167,6

  ‘if we were all on trial for our thoughts, we would all be hanged.’
the year is 1843 and grace marks has been arrested and convicted for her alleged involvement in two murders. she is only 16 years old and will spend the next 29 years incarcerated. but what would possess a young girl to commit such a crime? and why did she give three conflicting confessions of what happened? was it a crime of passion or unfortunate circumstances?the answers to these questions is exactly what dr. jordan hopes to discover. as the doctor prompts graces memories, the reader is immersed in a story surrounded by sex, violence, and insubordination, with the uncomfortable realisation that not everything is so black and white.atwood is a very thorough storyteller. its evident by reading this that atwood has exhausted all sources when researching grace marks and that tragic day in history. and whilst the subject matter is hauntingly gripping, my only complaint it this is a little dry. its a long exposé of graces character and is very slow at times (especially when recounting her early life), almost to the point where i become emotionally deattached from everything that was happening. but i cant deny that this dramatic tale is thought-provoking, as much as it is entertaining. its a definite must read for those who enjoy the true crime of historical fiction. ↠ 3.5 stars",160,8
72579,Alias Grace,Bionic Jean,"1,212",999,4,"January 28, 2023","""When you are in the middle of a story it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shattered glass and splintered wood; like a house in a whirlwind, or else a boat crushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboard powerless to stop it. It's only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story at all. When you are telling it, to yourself or to someone else.""This powerful passage is from Margaret Atwood's 1996 novel Alias Grace. She developed the novel from her television script ""The Servant Girl"" of 1974, and it was shortlisted for the Booker prize. The story is about the notorious 1843 murders of Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper Nancy Montgomery in Canada. Grace Marks and James McDermott, both servants in the household, were convicted of the crime. McDermott was hanged and Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment.Alias Grace is based on factual events. However the author explains that she has used verifiable facts wherever possible, but that where there were none she felt at liberty to embroider or invent. One of her creations is the character of a doctor, Simon Jordan, who researches the case. Although he is conducting research into criminal behaviour, he slowly becomes more and more personally involved in the story which is gradually unveiled to him by Grace Marks. He finds it increasingly difficult to reconcile the gentle, self-controlled woman he sees every day with the murderess who has been convicted.The novel follows the story of Grace's life, as she relates it to Doctor Jordan. These parts with Grace as the viewpoint character are cleverly written with no punctuation. Therefore, because they are written from Grace's point of view, the reader is never sure whether Grace is speaking or thinking. Atwood's use of language is poignant and evocative in these descriptions of events. Colours, smells, feelings - all are described in minute detail, which would be extraordinary feats of expression if spoken aloud by Grace herself. An example of this is the quotation above. It is attributed to Grace, but was this spoken aloud? Were these her own innermost thoughts? Or is it being addressed to the reader?Other parts are written from Doctor Jordan's point of view, although Atwood uses the third person in these passages, whereas for Grace, it is always ""I"". This switching between points of view makes the reader uncertain, and the narrative quite edgy. In addition, authentic newspaper articles and letters from doctors and those in charge of Grace during her time in prisons and asylums are interspersed at the end of some of the chapters. They are not chronological, which again adds to the disjointed feel of the text. Most of the detail is of events prior to the murders, and some date from a long time earlier, but we do find out what happens to both Grace and Doctor Jordan after the long consultations. Although in the afterword Atwood states that the facts are inconclusive, throughout the reader is trying to ascertain what really happened. We feel there is a mystery.  Was Grace insane, as some people believed? Was she a calculating murderess? Was she, as Doctor Jordan was grasping at, suffering from an as yet unidentified mental illness such as multiple personality?  At this distance we will never know, and in any event this is a novel. But it is very well-constructed and parts are beautifully written.",153,39
72579,Alias Grace,Lisa,971,3331,5,"November 13, 2018","""If we were all on trial for our thoughts, we would all be hanged."" When I first read Alias Grace, I thought it was ""less"" relevant than her other, almost prophetically painful novels. I changed my mind. Not immediately, and not deliberately. But slowly, steadily, like a patchwork taking form, I could see the novel in a new light long after I finished it. It grew in my memory as it faded, and all of a sudden, it occurred to me that it was a masterpiece of quiet rebellion where the other novels, like the Handmaid's Tale, Oryx and Crake, the Penelopiad or Cat's Eye are angry, eloquently shouted manifestos.What is sanity? That painful interregnun between phases of blissful insanity, as Poe wittily claims, or the opinion of the (insane) majority? What is murder? What is guilt? How can one determine what really happened if all people involved in the action live in different minds, meaning different realities? How do we establish ""truth"" in the tangle of myths, passions, prejudices and conventions?As always, we solve the mystery of a story by telling another, and Margaret Atwwod seemed to define my journey as a reader long before I knew what I was reading myself:""When you are in the middle of a story it isn't a story at all, but only a confusion; a dark roaring, a blindness, a wreckage of shattered glass and splintered wood; like a house in a whirlwind, or else a boat crushed by the icebergs or swept over the rapids, and all aboard powerless to stop it.

72579,Alias Grace,Jamie,321,238,5,"February 7, 2009","Margaret Atwood occupies a strange nook in my heart. She's become a bit of a chore lately, as I'm including her in my senior honors thesis; on the other hand, I've now read almost all of her novels, and while none are bad or even...not really good. Just that because a few of the novels shine so brightly, that the others seem duller in comparison.Well, Alias Grace is a supernova. It's an absolutely phenomenal novel, and a truly thrilling read. It's a departure for Atwood, as it's historical fiction (of course, she did do the Journals of Susanna Moodie before), but moreover, it employs similar narrative techniques as detective fiction, while turning them on their head--in any case, it's definitely a page-turner, which is not something you usually mention in conjunction with Atwood. This doesn't discount the literary merit--there's enough meat in the book to write a dissertation or five on it. There's something quite fresh in her style here, with many many passages I absolutely had to read aloud to whomever was (un)fortunate enough to be near me as I read.The general structure of the novel is from the outset quite fascinating--each section is tied under the flag of a quilt pattern, and each begins with a series of epigraphs, combining historical documents, poetry, ""witness accounts"" and so forth--ultimately questioning the validity of each, and how we reconfigure the past with necessarily limited frameworks at hand. Writing a fictionalized account of a historical person is itself an indictment of history, but Atwood takes it so much farther, and in much more wonderfully 'political' ways. Grace is still a frustrating enigma by the end of the text, but you'll adore her and her sly moves, her secret longings, and her storytelling ability--Dr. Jordan, as we discover, has no idea what he's getting into with her. It's certainly a dark read, and often I would have to lay the book down for at least a minute or two to catch my breath. But Atwood has a wonderful way of infusing humor into even the bleakest of moments, so there were just as many times when I found myself laughing aloud. This book will not leave you for a long time.",129,6
72579,Alias Grace,Candi,598,4532,5,"September 2, 2015","This book is a gem. A work of fiction, but based on actual historical events, Alias Grace is the story of the convicted murderess, Grace Marks. Sixteen year old Grace and fellow servant James McDermott are said to have brutally murdered their employer, Thomas Kinnear and his housekeeper and supposed mistress, Nancy Montgomery, in Canada during the 1840’s. However, Grace claimed to have no memory of her own culpability in these murders. Both were found guilty; James McDermott was condemned to death and Grace Marks was sentenced to life imprisonment in the Provincial Penitentiary in Kingston, Canada.In the novel, Grace’s story is revealed to Dr. Simon Jordan, a fictional, progressive, young doctor who is trained in the study of mental illnesses. Dr. Jordan’s expertise has been requested by a group of individuals who are petitioning for a pardon for Grace. Grace’s story, as she relates it in the first person to Dr. Jordan, is so very compelling, I could not put this book down. I was immediately drawn to Grace as she so expressively recounted her memories of her childhood, her migration to Canada from Ireland, her new life as a servant, her trial and her life in prison. Just like Dr. Jordan, I at first wondered about her guilt, her sanity, and whether or not she was speaking with candor or artifice. The prose here is so wonderfully moving. At the end of one of her sessions with Dr. Jordan, Grace says, either to the reader or to herself:“While he writes, I feel as if he is drawing me; or not drawing me, drawing on me – drawing on my skin – not with the pencil he is using, but with an old-fashioned goose pen, and not with the quill end but with the feather end. As if hundreds of butterflies have settled all over my face, and are softly opening and closing their wings.”“But underneath that is another feeling, a feeling of being wide-eyed awake and watchful. It’s like being wakened suddenly in the middle of the night, by a hand over your face, and you sit up with your heart going fast, and no one is there. And underneath that is another feeling still, a feeling like being torn open; not like a body of flesh, it is not painful as such, but like a peach; and not even torn open, but too ripe and splitting open of its own accord. And inside the peach there’s a stone.”Grace also has a way of discerning others that is at times both shrewd and witty. I felt as if she could easily have switched roles with Dr. Jordan – she being the analyst and he being the subject of her scrutiny rather than vice versa. And, Dr. Jordan, I felt was verily in need of some rehabilitation of his own psyche!  In addition, I found even her general observations of her surroundings to be rather droll. I found myself laughing out loud on occasion. In her description of a bustle, she says “it was like having another bum tied on top of your real one and the two of them following you around like a tin bucket tied to a pig.” Grace’s narrations of her dreams, too, were so vivid; I could feel the stirring emotions these evoked. “I was seeing it all for the first time, although I also knew I had been there before, as is the way in dreams… And I longed to be there, although in the dream I was there already; but I had a great yearning towards this house, for it was my real home.”I grew to admire Grace throughout this book. But, was she innocent or guilty of the heinous crime for which she was convicted? Are we, the readers, able to come to a conclusion based on Ms. Atwood’s spin on this factual event? Or, is that not the real purpose here – to come to a veritable conclusion? No matter what you conclude, the consummate storytelling in this Atwood novel is well worth your time.",125,31
72579,Alias Grace,Baba,"3,503",725,4,"April 16, 2022","Margaret Atwood had a long time fascination with 19th century Canada's most sensational murders and trial, where the Irish-Canadian 15 year old housemaid, Grace Marks was co-accused and divided many - those that thought she was a cold killer and those that thought she was a tad naive and just another victim of the 20-year old James McDermott. In Alias Grace, Atwood takes us for a whirl with a number of 'well-meaning' narrators pro and anti - Grace; and one honourable and honest, but stoic narrator or a very cunning unreliable narrator ...Grace Marks, devil, angel or something in between?With such a salacious topic to write about, it's almost a marvel that the book still completely centres around Grace and what we learn from what she thinks and tells us. I sat down almost presuming innocence from the off, her being a highly underprivileged girl with no real power, yet despite this, the more I read, the more torn I was. That's what I really liked about the way the story is presented to the reader, the more you know, the less you know. Yes Grace was and is treated horrendously from her childhood through to her trial and then imprisonment; but did that make her a murderer or did it make her vulnerable to being caught up in a murder?This is technically an epistolary novel, although some of the entries are so long it doesn't feel like it is. Atwood conjures up a not often seen Canada a few years before the American Civil War, and through a number of characters sets the out the status quo of the time. The historical backdrop is fascinating, as was the way they diagnosed and treated mental health; but of everything, it made me think, when I realised that sexism may have been the key to Grace's escape from the death penalty! Yet another Atwood good read, in this case, one that I feel went on too long - 8 out of 122020 read",124,N/A
72579,Alias Grace,Lotte,527,1102,5,"October 27, 2018","So, so good!Alias Grace questions the existence of an absolute truth. Moreover, how is what we think of as the truth informed by power structures (specifically, gender and class disparages)? Can someone who is deemed mad tell the truth? Who do you believe when push comes to shove? Even though this book was written in the 90s and is set in the middle of the 19th century, it remains an incredibly relevant read. I couldn’t help but read this story as commentary on current developments, such as the #MeToo movement – and what poignant commentary at that! Margaret Atwood manages to point out injustice and sexism, both overt and subtle, and I marked a lot of passages while reading. She also gives insight into the historical treatment of mental disorders and the development of what we know think of as psychiatry, which I found very fascinating.Apart from the interesting and important topics it discusses, Alias Grace also tells such a well crafted story and it managed to keep me completely engrossed while reading. It remains an ambiguous read until the end and it’s very much the kind of book that only gives you answers if you want them, while also offering some kind of resolution and closure, and I really appreciated that.I'd highly recommend Alias Grace and it's definitely the kind of book that will stick with me for a while!",116,1 comment
72579,Alias Grace,Paul Bryant,"2,161",9019,4,"July 7, 2009","At the very heart of certain narratives is a lacuna, to which the reader is drawn ineluctibly, as the centre of a whirlpool of meanings. It may indicate something essentially unknowable, ineffable - the lacuna in the Old Testament is when God tells Moses I AM THAT I AM, which lets us know in no uncertain terms that this thing is not of logic or language, whatever it may be; the lacuna of the New Testament is Christ's three days in the tomb - we are not told anything about that, it is unknowable. Or this gap in the story may indicate simply something someone does not wish to tell us - the very heart of the matter, the thing of shame, the motive. Here the gap is a void or avoidance. Psychologically powerful avoidance fuelled by intense guilt makes a hair-raising narrative, as the reader, writer and protagonist gradually converge together and find themselves in the belly of the beast - two memorable examples from non-fiction are Fritz Stangl's horrible wrestling with his past as commandant of Treblinka in Gitta Sereney's series of interviews with him (""Into that Darkness"") and Michaud & Aynesbury's interviews with Ted Bundy (""Conversations with a Killer""). In both cases we are caught up in the subtle and confrontational stratagems the interviewers use to get the monster to acknowledge an identification with the previous self who committed the atrocities. Stangl ferociously hangs on to the ""it was just a job, a really really difficult job"" line until he cracks - and how dramatic to read that a day or so after he finally - finally - admits that he was personally responsible for what he had done, he dies of a heart attack. Bundy constructs a way of describing his crimes by ""speculating"" about them in the third person, contemplating how the person who perpetrated them ""might have been"" feeling, of how he ""was reacting inappropriately to stress in his life"". He edges to the very rim of acceptance of guilt but can't manage the swan-dive into what we non-serial killers assume to be the cleansing waters of catharsis which await those who accept their crimes and seek atonement.  Alias Grace's story likewise is a stately sarabande of 550 pages around the central question - did she do it? Suspended from that mystery, the ponderous but pillowy narrative describes the life of Grace Marks in her own languid hyper-observational manner (a great fictional voice) and counterposes this with the fervid cavortings of the brain doctor sent to ferret out her great secret. He's quite a scream.  So anyway, this book is squarely in that genre I call Modern Victorian, in which the contemporary novelist writes us another great big Victorian story but being modern can put in all the filth and flesh, all the naming of parts which the real Victorian novelists couldn't do. It turns out, from what I've read so far, to be a great idea. Consider these -1) The Crimson Petal and the White (Michel Faber) - completely brilliant and nearly 1000 pages too 2) The Quincunx (Charles Palliser) - completely brilliant and just over 1000 pages3) Fingersmith (Sarah Waters) - yes, just about completely brilliant too4) The French Lieutenant's Woman (John Fowles) - acknowledged by all to be fairly brilliantVery glad to add Alias Grace to this select list and will be happy to grab up other Modern Victorians as they swim my way. Alias Grace likes, in its modern way, to leave a lot of stuff unanswered and without chucking in a huge horrid spoiler here, I can't reveal why I think that part of the Central Revelatory Scene was pure codswallop, but that didn't make no never mind. Margaret Atwood's big book sails onward, sad, sumptuous, and very slightly sexy too.",115,22
72579,Alias Grace,Luís,"1,791",431,3,"September 24, 2022","Margaret Atwood relied heavily on an authentic and famous fact to imagine what could have happened to Grace Marks, a beautiful fifteen-year-old girl accused of a double murder and sentenced to death before being finally sentenced to perpetuity. For this, it features the fictitious doctor Simon Jordan who came to study the twists and turns of the brain and, more specifically, of memory to retrace the entire journey of this young woman locked up for already fifteen years: her birth in Northern Ireland, the alcoholic and violent father, their migration to Canada, arrival in Toronto, and finally her work as a servant with Mr Kinnear and his housekeeper and mistress Nancy Montgomery, whom she was accused of complicity in murder with her so-called lover James McDermott.The story's genuine interest lies in the ambiguity of Grace's words when she agrees to confide in Doctor Jordan. She appears at the same time young, naive, weak, gentle and intelligent, vaguely manipulative, secretive, jealous and vengeful. Is she sane and simulative? Did she forget what happened on the day of the murder? Or is she demented, simple-minded?Many points will remain unexplained at the novel's end despite the latest adventures, particularly his guilt.Margaret Atwood made all the characters complex and made us go around in circles; it's never really as we imagine. In short, it's an excellent psychological novel that I enjoyed reading and opened many doors.",92,2

  Murderess is merely brutal. It's like a hammer, or a lump of metal. I would rather be a murderess than a murderer, if those are the only choices.
 This is the story of Grace Marks. A most unfortunate woman-- depending on how you look at it.The story starts with Grace in prison, serving life after being granted clemency in the trial after the murders of Thomas Kinnear and Nancy Montgomery. Out of the gravel there are peonies growing, the story begins. A dream that Grace had which she is relating to Dr Simon Jordan. A perpetually horny and well-meaning doctor on a tour to study crimes of mania and insanity. Grace Marks was working as a maid at sixteen years of age when her employer, Thomas Kinnear and his mistress/housekeeper are brutally murdered by James McDermott and her, allegedly. Some accounts believe that James is her paramour and he conducted the killings on Grace's coercion. However, other people believe that Grace was just a hapless captive. A stupid witless pawn who got embroiled in a conspiracy that had her in way over her head. This book is startling. I often had to remind myself that Atwood published this in 1996. It reeks of Victorian era Canada, accurate in its gothic nature and sensibilities. Oft times it got caught in its own dogma. The puritanism, sexism, ignorance, marginal progressivism and proto-feminism of the era. In his student days, he used to argue that if a woman has no other course open to her but starvation, prostitution, or throwing herself from a bridge, then surely the prostitute, who has shown the most tenacious instinct for self-preservation, should be considered stronger and saner than her frailer and no longer living sisters. One couldn't have it both ways, he'd point out: if women are seduced and abandoned, they're supposed to go mad,(I now realise this was remarkable foreshadowing) but if they survive, and seduce in their turn, then they were mad to begin with. The language in this is also enticing. When we get to explore Grace, I sit with my rough hands folded, eyes down, staring at the flowers in the Turkey carpet. Or they are supposed to be flowers. They have petals in the shape of diamonds on a playing card; like the cards spread out on the table at My Kinnear's, after the gentlemen had been playing the night before. Hard and angular. But red, a deep thick red. Thick strangled tongues.It's so easy to find yourself mired in the world of Grace who suffers from chronic main character syndrome. She often reacts to things that affect others way more than her but it's all about her feelings. Her reactions. Her world rocked. She recounts the story about how her family immigrated from Ireland to Canada, only for tragedy to strike during passage and once more it was all about how it affected her. Grace is also obsessed with the imagery of flowers and water. I was often befuddled as to whether her obsession with peonies had any narrative value. Eventually I wondered if it was just Atwood high on her own prose just having a ball. This book is surprising in its relatability. For all of her naivete, Grace has an alacritous ability to peer into the human condition. When she remembers that she may never have children due to her prison sentence, When you are sad it is best to change the subject.When she reminisces the tragic life of her old friend Mary Whitney...saying what you really want out loud brings bad luck, and then the good thing will never happen. She was even a bit of an amateur nihilist, A sea voyage and a prison may be God's reminder to us that we are all flesh, and that all flesh is grass, and all flesh is weak.This book is also ridiculously funny. ...as with crows, when you see two or three of them gathered together you know there is a death in the offing, and they are discussing it. With the crows they are deciding which parts they will tear open and make off with, and so it is with the doctors. Especially, according to Grace, if they have a leather bag or knives. Before going to bed, she greased the skin of her face like a boot.Perhaps the strongest arsenal in this punch of a book is its characterisation. Grace's anecdotes of the people she encounters give such powerful portraits of them. Grace's pragmatic observations of the people around her (while possibly mendacious) showed dynamics that created room for treachery, jealousies and negative passions. One that particularly stood out to me was a moment between Grace and Nancy. 
  Oh Grace, said Nancy, we will have to kill a chicken, just step out and request McDermott to do it. I said that surely we would need two chickens, as there would be six to dine, with the ladies; but she was annoyed, and said there would be no ladies, as the wives of these gentlemen never condescended to darken the door of the house, and she herself would not be taking dinner with them in the dining room, as all they would do was drink and smoke and tell stories about what fine deeds they'd done in the Rebellion, and the would stay too long and play cards after, and it was bad for Mr Kinnear's health, and he would catch a cough, as was always the case when these men came to visit. She allowed him a poor constitution when it suited her.
 Grace's sometimes uncharitable opinions of Nancy make you wonder, could she have possibly been more complicit than she would have us believe?She was fond of fainting spells and espousing her aforementioned weak constitution, even so much as crying when the chicken was slaughtered. My favourite part of the book, apart from the prose, was the subtle commentary of society. Atwood jabs at norms relevant to modern day human behaviour. From pathologising women, to the patriarchal expectation of women to perform and exist for the whims of men, to tabloid culture the newspaper journalists like to believe the worst; they can sell more papers that way, as one of them told me himself; for even upstanding and respectable people dearly love to read ill of others.This book had everything and then some. I'm so glad I got to buddy read it with Raul. And while I may be able to write a thesis on the feminist relevance of villainised women, I shall just leave you with this quote by Grace which left me shook, 
  ...you may think a bed is a peaceful thing, Sir, and to you it may mean rest and comfort and a good night's sleep. But it isn't so for everyone; and there are many dangerous things that may take place in a bed. It is where we are born, and that is our first peril in life; and it is where the women give birth... And finally beds are what we sleep in, and where we dream, and often where we die.

72579,Alias Grace,Madeline,766,46900,3,"September 15, 2008","I'm giving this three stars, but the correct rating would be 2 1/2 stars - I liked this book, for the most part, but there were just too many unanswered questions and minor annoyances for me to want to read it again. Usually, I hate giving away the endings of books in my reviews, but I honestly cannot talk about Alias Grace without giving away major plot points. You've been warned. So: for the most part, this was a cool story, mostly because it's based on the true story of Grace Marks, who supposedly helped murder her employer and his housekeeper. She served thirty years in prison, plus several years in a mental institution. Atwood's story has two perspectives: Grace Marks and Simon Jordan, a doctor who's interviewing her and basically trying to get her to remember the day of the murders. This was all pretty cool, and I liked Grace a lot as a protagonist. So let's move on to the negative. Stuff I Didn't Like:-Simon creeped me out. One minute he's half-heartedly flirting with the daughter of the prison Govenor while mentally undressing her, and then he's screwing his landlady for reasons that even he doesn't understand. And then towards the end of the book he's suddenly like, ""Oh wait! I'm in love with Grace! Yes! Totally in love"" and it made NO SENSE. This was the first time I'd read a book where Atwood writes from a man's perspective, and it did not go well. -I guessed the ending. This is an extremely bad sign, because I can NEVER guess book endings, ever. But with this book, I'd gotten to the part where Grace describes how McDermott told her she'd promised to sleep with him, and she was like, ""I did not"" and I thought, ""She's being possessed by the spirit of Mary Whitney."" And then I thought that it had to be more complicated than that, and that there would be a scientific explanation for it. But there wasn't. Which brings me to my next point...-Atwood's half-hearted commitment to the paranormal aspect of the story. The hypnosis scene revealed that Mary was possessing Grace, but then everyone was like, ""But that's not possible, there's a psychological explanation"" but they never gave one. All the elements of a good ghost story are here: the peddlar who reads palms, divination with an apple peel, people making strange, random prophesies (like Grace's mother saying she wouldn't survive the voyage, and Mary telling Grace she'd cross water three times before getting married), and the bizarre possession. But Atwood, probably because she didn't want to lose her credibility or something, refrains from going all-out with the paranormal events. If she'd have relaxed a bit and written the book as a ghost story instead of historic fiction, it would have been really good. -The whole hypnosis. I was sure it was all an act, because Jeremiah had been telling Grace earlier about setting up a fake spiritualist act, but then Grace didn't seem to remember anything about the hypnosis or what she said during it. So could Jeremiah actually hypnotize people? After the hypnosis scene, and as soon as I realized I was expected to believe that it had been authentic, was when my faith in the story really started to drop. It was all downhill from there.-No twist ending. I was waiting, up until the last page, for Grace to be like, ""I'm so glad I killed those two bastards. Mwahahahaha! The end."" But no such luck. In retrospect, I should have known better - Atwood hates giving readers a straight answer to anything, and conclusive endings where everything gets wrapped up in a neat little package is for lesser authors, I guess.
