10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Stephanie *Eff your feelings*,239,1173,3,"March 21, 2013","*Poke* *Poke* *Poke*""AAAAHHHHHH!! What the?.....who the?....where the?""""When the?""""Stephanie wake up! It's Claire Fraser. What are you doing here? And should you be driving that contraption? You smell like a brewery!!""""Oh Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ!....whaa....I'm not *hicup* a-saxtly sure how I ended up here. Oh look..hee...hee... I'm sitting on the time mower.....Kemper ish going to be sooo pissed at me, but what else is new?....haaaaaaaa!"" *slowly sides off time mower in heap* “Claire, what happened to her?” “Jamie....do you remember Stephanie? She’s another time traveler like me, but she’s from somewhere in the 2010’s.”The corner of Jamie’s mouth twitched in a wry smile, “Aye, I do. I’d say that lassie is drunk!” he rubbed his knuckle on his long straight nose. Holding my hand up “That’s because I am....very, very drunk. Ya see, I read another book *hic* in the series that has been written about your lives, A Breath of Snow and Ashes. Don’t ask me how this is poshsible, I don’t know, but it’s most likely something to do with you messing about with time. Anyhow, just for funnzies I decided to make a drinking game out of the book, whenever you said “Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ” I took a shot of whiskey since you all drink the stuff like water and I thought whatzz good fer the goose is good for the gander.......Haaaaaa.......weeee!“Why would you do that? Not a wise move if you asked me, I say that ALL the time.” Said Claire. “I KNOW! That was the point......Well, I didn’t ask you Claire because I don’t think you make the wisest choice with the whiskey yourself! By the way, who the hell do you think you are judging me about my alcohol consumption? Around here it’s the answer for everything. Pregnant? Drink some whiskey. Just vomited from being sedated with homemade ether? Drink some whiskey. Been gang raped? Drink some whiskey....okay that one makes sense. Whatever is going on the answer is “drink more whiskey!!” One has to admire that. It’s a damn good thing that I didn’t pick the words ‘wry, knuckle, or rubbed’ or I would be in an alcoholic coma or worse, dead.”Jamie looked at me and narrowed his cat eyes “If our lives and the words the lady who writes these books uses bothers ya so much, why do ya keep reading them?” The corner of his mouth twitched in a wry smile and he rubbed his long straight nose with his knuckle......again.“That’s an excellent question Jamie and I don’t have a good answer for you other then that I can’t quit you.....either of you.” *sigh*“Awe Stephanie, that’s so sweet I could cry. I think we need to drink to that!” said Claire. “Suuure…..what’s a little more whiskey gonna hurt at this point?” Said I. Jamie pours us all a dram of whiskey, says something in Gallic, and we all drink it down in one swallow. He then rubs his long straight nose with his knuckle and smiles wryly. “One thing I can say in the positive about the authors’, Diana Gabaldon, word choices is that she never ever uses the words ‘throbbing’ and ‘member’ together, and with all the sex scenes in all of these books that’s saying something.” *Blushes* “She writes about…..mm hmm? What happens at night between me....and my wife?” asks Jamie. “Oh sure…between the two of you, and between Roger and Brianna, between any two people who may cross paths, I’m pretty sure that’s why so many people read the books.” I said.“She’s also obsessed with describing hair. Seriously how many times must we hear about hair? I know everything there is to know about everybody’s hair in the history of ever. Yours Jamie is always a fire and Claire, you constantly have escaping curls.” I said “but I guess that’s better than the last book, The Fiery Cross, where Diana was obsessed with describing every detail about every dirty diaper, or clout as you call them, that adorable little angelic Gem produced. Forget about the obsession with lactating breasts…..and sex with, around, and about lactating breasts…..and the sticky aftermath. I couldn’t even come back and talk to you about it, any review I tried to write just came out dirty, and not always in a good way.”“That sounds disgusting.” Said Claire. “At times it was” I said.“Well, I better get this thing back to its owner before he misses it. I’m not scared of the guy, he likes to pretend he’s evil and all by wearing fake felt mustaches….but he doesn’t fool me.” I said, and then set the time mower for home instead of Kansas; if Kemper wants his time mower back he’ll just have to come to Ohio and get it.“Haahaa ha…..Mwa ha ha……MWAHAHAHHAHAHAAAAA!!!” I did enjoy this book more than the previous one. It's a 3.5. There was a new time traveler from her time that enter the story and I was disappointed with how the author handled this character. There was a potential there for something really interesting and she decided to make the character boring instead. But overall it was entertaining.",298,125
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Trudi,615,1393,2,"September 3, 2008","The paperback edition of what is the sixth book in the Outlander series is over 1500 pages long and sorry to say, I did not hang on every word. Who could? There's so damn many of them! Talk about bloated. Diana Gabaldon's editor must love her a lot, or is just too nice for the business. ""Kill your darlings"" -- remember that timeless piece of advice from Mark Twain? I love Jamie and Claire (not so much Roger and Brianna) and have been hooked since Outlander, but the series is floundering, and has been for some time. I could not even finish the fifth book, The Fiery Cross. As for Breath of Snow and Ashes, how many times can any handful of people escape from prison, mob scenes, near death, kidnappings, etc, etc. Maybe I'm just cranky because while I was reading this tome, I could have finished at least four other books on my to-read list. But I sacrificed, I persevered, and I wanted to LOVE this book, I really did. But alas, it was not meant to be. There was enough Jamie and Claire antics, and classic Gabaldon humor, to recommend this title, but only to hardcore Outlander fans. Remember, 1500 pages is a huge chunk of prose which translates into a huge investment of your precious reading time. Approach with caution. ",202,52
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Melissa ♥ Dog/Wolf Lover ♥ Martin,"3,365",9426,5,"May 30, 2017","I got through another door stopper =) But this one made me freaking cry in the end. Just nooooooooo. I will talk about that later. I still love it though! I guess I'm going to add some *SPOILERS*So this review is in no particular order. As I have said before I'm listening to them on audio and marking my place in the book and they are all starting to run together. And there are lots of things going on in the books and I love most all of it. Not the bad stuff! There are some funny parts in the book. I think my favorite is when Bree is in the shed chasing off a raccoon that is eating their food and Roger comes in - scares her- and she nails him in the head with a potato! I wanted to add the excerpt of this but I didn't mark the freaking spot, but I was rolling with laughter at that part and Roger's reaction. There's a funny part about a snake in the church. And I can't remember the others because I'm all upset about the ending. Nothing major just wait. Life is going along with everyone. BUT . . . Marsali (Fergus wife) and Claire are out at the thingy working on the stuff for booze. They are all by themselves because they think nothing of it. Some arsehole men show up, attack the women because they want the booze but the woman can't give them what they don't have. These freaking jerks kick Marsali in the pregnant stomach and take off with Claire. Claire gets raped of course and beaten to within an inch of her life. I think these are also the same men that killed a family, sold some of the kids and burned another one alive in the home. I think these were the same ones. Oh, how death needs to come to them. And it does. . . all the evil people should meet the same end. Anyway, Jamie wrings a neck and has the boys kill the rest of the gang. Takes Claire through to make her look at all of the dead so that she knows they are gone and can't hurt her any more. It was horrible. And the part before all of this, when Jamie and Roger find that family killed and the little girl still alive in the burned house, OMG, I can't even. I mean Roger had to suffocate her because it was so dreadful and I felt sorry for everyone involved. Marsali and Fergus have another child and he's a dwarf that Marsali names Henri-Christian. So they have a ton of kids now. But some arsehole jerk little kids tried to drown Henri and luckily Roger was there to save him and give those evil kids what for. Not long after that Fergus tried to kill himself and luckily Jamie was there and it made me so sad. Jamie and Claire had to send them away and got Fergus a job at a printer and Fergus was happy so hopefully all of that will work out. Bree got to finally get her vengeance on her rapist. She shot him in the head. Good riddance. Bree and Roger also had a little girl named Amanda Claire Hope and there were some medical issues with her that Claire couldn't fix because it was one of those advanced things. This is where I get really sad because Bree, Roger and the kids went back through the stones to save the baby. And now Claire and Jamie only have Ian and it's so freaking sad because that whole family was there and I want them back. Just damn it all =( Also, in these books there are always references to the other books and things that happened. Explanations and I like that! Even still, I'm sad - BUT. . . on to the next.MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List",191,28
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Karen,793,1004,5,"August 7, 2014"," 5 STARS!!!!!!!!! JESUS H. ROOSEVELT CHRIST!!!!!!
  
What can I say that hasn't already been said about Diana Gabaldon and her fabulous Outlander books!!! This is yet another. Claire and Jamie's story continues here in the wilderness and growing new world of North Carolina. So many mysteries brought to the foreground in this episode, and many more laid out. 
  
Jamie FraserThe American revolution is in full swing, and Jamie finds himself caught between a loyalty to his king and a betrayal he knows he must make in order to survive the conflict. His knowledge of the events to come have him walking a thin line between honor and treason, and to the shock of his oldest friends and countrymen, his choice will surprise them all.
  
Claire FraserAnd Claire... OMG Claire has so many life altering events to overcome in this book. I frequently found myself biting my nails down to the quick wondering how the hell she would get out of this story alive, or without permanent scars, both inside and out. But as usual she perseveres with tenacious ferocity as usual. I just love her character... and Bree's. These are some strong women!!!! Brianna Fraser MackenzieThen there is Brianna and Roger... So many traumatic events and shocking revelations... These two are quickly growing into my favorite characters. Their romance in no way shares the passion of Jamie and Claire's but it is showing fantastic potential in doing just that. And the kids.... I love all the kids!!!! Jemmy and especially Germain, Fergus' boy. This whole band of little people had me laughing and crying with joy throughout the book. Roger MackenzieOne of the things I love most about these books is the real-life dramas that continue to plague the characters. I can easily say that even through the explanation of many of the historical events that are occurring at the time, the continuous myriad of changing characters and situations, the medical explanation, and the constantly changing points of view... I never once... not once got bored. There was so much action packed into these thousand pages that I didn't regret a single one. I only have one book left, until the final book next summer, and then I will be sadly mourning my daily dose of Outlander. Diana Gabaldon... I have nothing but the highest of praise and thanks for you in creating these fabulous characters and epic, EPIC stories!!!!The Infamous White Sow!!!Nothing less than 5 STARSnow on to book 6... YAY!!!!!",79,28
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,3,"August 31, 2016","Still hardly any plot, just people doing things, a few kidnappings, rapes and childbirths, a million of scenes of Clare healing someone. But at least Brianna wasn't lactating all book long this time. ",71,14
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Mo,"1,348",2,5,"August 26, 2014","I feel I have already written a review, with all the updates I did!! Where to start? We know these books are long. It’s taking me, on average, three weeks to read them. So, you sort of have to be dedicated to the genre and writing style to appreciate them.Jamie and Claire are living in North Carolina. Their passion is still alive, their love is still true. I absolutely love this couple. Have loved watching them grow older together.“Ye’ve no idea how lovely ye look, stark naked, wi’ the sun behind you. All gold, like ye were dipped in it.” A lot happens in this book and some questions from the previous books are answered.  “I canna look at ye asleep without wanting to wake ye, Sassenach.” His hand cupped my breast, gently now. “I suppose I find myself lonely without ye.” Her writing is very descriptive and she pays a LOT of attention to detail. There was one part where Claire was making Black Pudding and I swear to God I swore I would never touch the stuff again… I know I probably will, I just don’t want to know how it is made.Roger and Brianna were wonderful also. And wee Jemmy, what a hoot he was! Loved him.Vroom, vroom!I won’t say too much as it would give things away and spoil the reading for others. Or spoil the TV show if some of you will not read the books.“I chose my way when I wed ye, though I kent it not at the time. But I chose, and cannot now turn back, even if I would.''Would you?' I looked into his eyes as I asked, and read the answer there. He shook his head.'Would you? For you have chosen, as much as I.” The books is so much more than my review. There is Ian, Lizzie, the twins, Malva, the Bugs, Lord John, Bonnet, Jocasta and many more. Pieces of the puzzle are put together, and some pieces are left for us to discover in the next books. I must applaud Lizzie for her ""way"" of ensuring that she got what she wanted. Apologies for bombarding you with so many updates!",57,84
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Natalie,285,61,4,"February 3, 2021","Poor, poor Claire...Diana Gabaldon sent you to hell and back in this book didn’t she? She had to endure one kidnapping, one group rape, having her husband being accused of impregnating a young girl, said girl murdered, getting arrested, losing her daughter, again, and grandchildren, to another time..What’s her problem anyway? Is it too much to ask that she and Jamie will get one moment of peace. I would have though that twenty years apart would warrant some kind of second honeymoon?I never thought I’d say this, but I actually like Bree and Roger more and more. Still not enough though. But going from reading about Jamie and Claire to Brianna and Roger gave a certain nice.. diversity. But they were given way more space then they should have had for my taste. Some of their storylines were actually emotional and interesting though. But who am I kidding here? Was this book solely about Jamie and Claire this book would have been a big, fat 5! They freaking rocked! As usual.I’ve read the series multiple times and they are all amazing books. They are actually in my third of favorite series of all time. Diana’s writing style and attention to detail is crazy amazing. She manages to paint a picture for you without boring you in the process. These books are so huge that they can be intimidating to start. But, in the process of time and a certain amount of rereads, I’ve gone from thinking these books are too huge, detailed and slowly paced to pretty perfect...really. I’m still not thrilled of all the various point of views, they make me loose a little interest, but I have come to accept and semi liking them. I just try ro take it for what it is. I’m surprising myself but I’ve come to like all characters and every small detail of the 18th century’s America, although I do further miss my beloved Scotland. And to be honest, I would only like to read about Claire and Jamie if I got one wish. “A Breath of Snow and Ashes” was filled with adventures, drama, heart stopping moments and emotional storylinesso many things happened. It was like ten books in one. I wish I was a better reviewer so I could do amazing novels like “A Breath of Snow and Ashes” justice. Too bad that Bree and Rogers POVs slowed this awesome book down. I’ve tried to like them for years now, I really have, but I just don’t care about them. Not enough anyway, I’m sorry. They are good and solid characters, don’t get me wrong. But for me, Outlander is Claire and Jamie’s story. I wouldn’t mind though if Roger and Bree and their kids were side characters, possibly in the future. But unfortunately, they have taken over more and more and with that, I do loose interest.",52,19
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Ashley,"2,550",1631,3,"March 8, 2016","This book covers the adventures of the extended Fraser-McKenzie clan through the years 1772-1776, and oh God, you feel every one of them.I picked up this book in late August 2015. I just finished it last week. For those of you as bad at math as I am, that is NINE MONTHS. I coulda grown a whole baby in the time it took me to read this book. If I was a cat, maybe dozens of babies. A rabbit . . . at least a hundred. (If I was an elephant I would still be pregnant.)According to Goodreads, it took me eighteen days to read Outlander, four days to read Dragonfly in Amber (Sidenote: Holy shit! how did I do that?), eleven days to read Voyager, seven days to read Drums of Autumn, and only nine days to read what felt like the interminably long The Fiery Cross. And really, I was on track to finish this one in a reasonable (for this series) amount of time. I read the first 54% in six days. And then I put it down and just . . . never picked it back up again. That was on September 2nd. I made a token effort on December 7th; read about six pages. Then put it back down again and didn’t pick it back up again until March 1st.That’s not good! I shouldn’t have been able to do that. I should have been clamoring to see what happened next. I wasn’t. Nothing felt urgent at all. And I will admit, this book is SO much better than the previous one. Actual thematic relevance across storylines. Things moving forward (albeit glacially). And even though I have some problems with the repeated cycle of violence against these characters, at least here while I was reading, it was always interesting. (Not so in Fiery Cross.)The problem is there’s just TOO MUCH OF IT.In case you were wondering whether it is possible to in fact have too much of a good thing, this book is proof that you can.1,439 pages. ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PAGES.I know that part of the appeal of these books is that they are long, and I like long books! The length of the series itself, and the length of each individual book, really allow you to spend time with these characters and sink yourself into their world. But this one (and the last one) just go too far. 1,000-1,100 pages would have been okay and doable. Easily 400 pages of this monster could have been cut. Sure we would have lost some cute scenes, but were they really necessary? Especially when the alternative is that your book is so bloated it loses track of its own plot.And really, couldn’t we also have cut out entirely that plot with Claire getting kidnapped (and raped)? Was that necessary? Especially since she’s put into peril at the end of the book as well. And yet again we have Brianna being rescued from Stephen Bonnet in an extended sequence that we’ve already seen before. At least this time he’s gone for good. (But again, I was so ready for him to be gone, I couldn’t even fully appreciate how good that scene was at the end between him and Brianna.)It’s like that how you sometimes say you’re using belt and suspenders to indicate that you’re maybe doing something not necessary. Gabaldon is a belt and suspenders writer. She doesn’t just use one, she uses both, and then on top of that she also sows her pants to her shirt JUST IN CASE. And maybe also brings along an extra pair of pants in her purse.At least most of the scenes in this one weren’t mind-numbing as well as repetitive and somewhat unnecessary. I’d rather read about Lizzie accidentally getting knocked up by the Beardsley twins and then marrying both of them, that tiny little bigamist, than read about ghost bears, Brianna's engorged breasts, and the state of Jemmy’s diapers.But really, I think the main problem here is that Gabaldon was trying to bridge the years in between Brianna finding her family and marrying Roger at the end of Drums of Autumn, and the coming American Revolution, and it took her two books to do it when she should have done it in one. Nothing interesting happens politically in that time that couldn’t have been covered in one book. For two books it’s been: THE REVOLUTION IS COMING THINGS ARE HAPPENING. But nothing *actually* happens until the end of this book.All the books have had backbones except these two. Outlander had Jamie and Claire meeting in 1740s Scotland, and Claire’s journey to decide to stay in the past. Dragonfly had them trying to stop the Rising in France and learning to be a married couple. Voyager was them finding their way back to each other after so long apart, and Brianna learning the truth and coming to terms with her family’s past. And Drums of Autumn had all those threads coming together, so that they’re finally all settled together on Fraser’s Ridge in North Carolina. Fiery Cross and A Breath of Snow and Ashes was basically, “Hey the Revolution is coming! No, really it is! We promise! Just bear with me a sec!” ""Oh, and also, life in these times was dangerous and men will rape you."" And meanwhile, all the characters were mostly stuck in one place for two VERY long books (more if you count all the time on Fraser's Ridge in Drums of Autumn). It was claustrophobic, and she would have done better skipping those years or fast forwarding through them, I think, rather than wading through them. Domestic bliss is nice for the characters, not so nice for readers. And neither is manufactured drama (which after a while, all that repetitive peril starts to feel like).Anyway, I’ve heard the next two books are pretty good, and the Revolution HAS started. There are emotional conflicts involved for all the Frasers, now that Jamie’s son is on the other side, and the McKenzies are back in the future.It might be a while before I actually dive in, though. I’m not a masochist.",40,14

Centered on time travelling 20th century doctor Claire Randall and her 18th century Scottish Highlander warrior husband Jamie Fraser, the books contain elements of historical fiction, romance, adventure and science fiction/fantasy.Claire is the wife of Jamie Fraser, her 18th century husband, and facing the politics and turmoil of the forthcoming American Revolution. The preceding novel, The Fiery Cross, concluded with political unrest in the colonies beginning to boil over and the Fraser's trying to peacefully live on their isolated homestead in the foothills of North Carolina. Jamie is suddenly faced with walking between the fires of loyalty to the oath he swore to the British crown and following his hope for freedom in the new world.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز هفدهم ماه مارس سال 2018 میلادیعنوان: بیگانه (غریبه): کتاب ششم: نفس برف و خاکستر؛ نویسنده: دایانا گبلدون؛کلر، با همسر سده هیجدهمی خویش جیمی فریزر، با سیاست و آشفتگیهای انقلاب آینده ی آمریکایی روبرو شده است. رمان پیشین «صلیب آتشین»، با ناآرامیهای سیاسی، در مستعمره ها آغاز، و «جیمی فریزر» تلاش کرد، تا به طور مسالمت آمیز، در خانه های دور افتاده ی خود، در کوهپایه های «کارولینای شمالی» زندگی کند؛ «جیمی» ناگهان، با گام زدن میان وفاداری به سوگندی، که به تاج انگلستان خورده، و امید وی برای رسیدن به آزادی در دنیای تازه، روبرو شده است. و ...؛ ا. شربیانی",39,N/A

Something about it just drew me in and sunk it’s hooks into me and I found myself falling in love with these characters all over again. Because that’s really what this series is about, the characters. Sure the setting and the history is great but what really packs the punch is the characters and how much you become attached to them and to care for them. This book really reinforced for me, it renewed my love for these characters and I couldn’t have enjoyed it more! ",36,4

I can gladly say that I actually enjoyed this one.A Breath of Snow and Ashes still has your favorite couple, Jamie and Claire. Or maybe your least favorite? Who knows! Now I know I've had my fair share of ups and downs with these books and this couple but once they got to North Carolina - I was in. Now this is about the american revolution and how it is in full swing baby! Reading about how Jamie and Claire were apart of that was pretty interesting. They both have to make pretty tough and interesting decisions in this book. Especially with knowing about what's actually going to happen and how they can change the future. Then there's the whole loyalty thing that comes into play. Besides those two, there's Brianna and Roger who also deal with some crazy shit. I do love the romance and chemistry between Jamie and Claire more though - sorry, not sorry.Now I'm not going to name every character in this book because we meet a lot. There's too many to talk about or keep track of. In the end, I did enjoy this book. I wouldn't necessarily say it's my favorite out of the whole series because 1) that would be a lie and 2) that would be outlander - duh! ",30,1 comment
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Carole (Carole's Random Life),"1,633",448,4,"March 6, 2017","This review can also be found at Carole's Random Life in Books.I almost feel like Claire and Jamie are family. We have been through a lot together over the years and it seems like things never really get any easier do they? This was my first time through this book and I went ahead and did the audio instead of reading the paper version. This was a really long audio. Too long if I am being honest. I love Jamie, Claire, Brianna, Roger, and the whole gang but I was really ready to move on to something else by the time I finished this audio. Don't get me wrong this story is really good and I am glad that I listened to it but it almost exhausted me at a point.These books are a little different than what you would normally read. I always tell people that most books deal with a certain problem and have a definite story arc. Books in the Outlander series are very character driven and they don't focus on any particular plot point. It is really just all of the things that happen during this period in Jamie, Claire, Brianna, and Roger's lives. You do need to read this series in order because things from previous books do tend to pop up from time to time.So much happens in this book. Like I said, Jamie and Claire feel almost like family so when bad things happen to them, I really tend to feel it. Bad things do happen in this book. Things that made me want to cry, things that made me laugh, and things that made me mad. I do really like how Jamie and Claire's love for each other never wavers and even now that they are older, they still have a very healthy sex life. Davina Porter does a fabulous job in narrating this book. The voices and accents that she uses for all of the main characters have remained very consistent over the course of the series. I find it amazing how well she handles the male voices. Her Jamie is just perfection. I like how much emotion really shows in her voice as she reads this story. I am able to listen to her voice for hours at a time without ever tiring of it.I would highly recommend this series to others. This is a series that I plan to revisit from time to time because the characters are so wonderful and the writing is so well done. I will be continuing with this series in the near future.Initial ThoughtsI did enjoy this story. So much happens in this book. As much as I liked the story, it seemed to go on forever. With the audio time listed as 57 hours and 46 minutes, I do almost feel like I deserve some award for paying attention to anything for that long. ",26,2
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,Antoinette,716,32,3,"July 26, 2020","I breathed a sigh of relief by the end of the book. I hadn’t continued the series after Book 5, which I finished in 2002. But I got hooked on the Tv series, so once the show had caught up to where I left off, I decided I should continue the books. Wish I hadn’t- too verbose, too much unnecessary detail and too much lack of interest on my part. It was a good enough escapist read, but it just seemed more of the same. I think I’ll just happily continue watching the show and forget about the books- it’s not often I say that, but I am with this one. In contrast to the book, I thought I would keep my review short and sweet!",26,17
10965,A Breath of Snow and Ashes,La Crosse County Library,545,120,5,"June 16, 2022","I enjoyed it so much that I read it and then listened to it again as an audiobook! It may have been because I had forgotten I had finished the book. At times when I’ve read a long book, I will take a break and read a few shorter ones before starting another in the series. This was the case with this book, although, I truly thought I hadn't finished it. I started listening and realized that I had already read that part. I would skip ahead a chapter and listen more. The thing is, I was just really enjoying listening to the reader, hearing the correct pronunciations, and getting sucked back into the story that I ended up re-listening to the majority of the story. Diana does such a wonderful job with worldbuilding and character development. She truly transports you to another time and place. I enjoy historical fiction as a genre and just love her take on it. Her descriptions of settings, characters, and daily lives are so very easy to visualize and believe, while also providing historical context of the time. The book is filled with lovable characters' daily lives, choices they mull over, battles, injuries, romance, and people's resourcefulness living in remote areas. I was a huge fan of the books after reading the first in the series. While I really enjoy reading these books, I think I may be a convert to listening to the audiobooks. Hearing this story took the pleasure of the book up a whole level. For those diehard readers, I would challenge you to give this book a listen and see if you agree!Find this book and other titles within our catalog.",25,2
