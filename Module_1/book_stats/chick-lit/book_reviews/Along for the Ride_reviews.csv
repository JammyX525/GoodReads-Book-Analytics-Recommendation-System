5664985,Along for the Ride,Thomas,"1,399",8117,4,"March 16, 2011","Reading Sarah Dessen is like walking into an air-conditioned store after a hot, humid day in the sun. Reading Sarah Dessen is also like drinking an ice-cold smoothie after a long, harsh marathon. And finally, reading Sarah Dessen is like eating comfort food: you always know what you're going to get, a tasty, satisfying treat.Auden has just finished her senior year and looks forward to spending the summer like she usually does: staying home and studying, while occasionally attending the parties hosted by her mom for her grad students. However, instead of following routine like she usually does, Auden decides to spend the summer at the attractive beach town where her dad and his new family reside. There, she meets her half-sister, Thisbe, as well as her first group of real friends. But the most alluring thing about the town is Eli: an ambiguous, secretive young man who is an insomniac, just like Auden. Late at night, they explore the childhood Auden never had - they get to know each other, and open up from what has restricted them in the past.4.5 stars. I really love Sarah Dessen's writing. Previously stated by my plethora of similes in the first paragraph, it's just a comfort to be able to read her work. The strongest aspect of Dessen's novels are her characters. They are perfectly written - nuanced, flawed, yet so extremely likable and fleshed out. There's something that readers can relate to in every character: whether it be the driven determination of Auden's mom, or the insecurity Auden has with failing, etc.The only reason Along for the Ride didn't receive the full five stars is because I felt there was something missing: there wasn't the extra punch Dessen usually delivers in her books. I just wanted to make it clear that it's not because of how formulaic some find her books to be. I simply space out the time between her novels, so I don't feel like I'm reading the same story over and over.Overall, very good. I'm already looking forward to reading another book by Sarah Dessen.Want to read more of my reviews? Follow me here.",208,31
5664985,Along for the Ride,jessica,"2,475",29600,4,"February 27, 2019","the thing that i love most about sarah dessen novels is the effortlessness and ease in which i am transported to a younger time, a carefree time. when adult worries are forgotten and young love is all that matters. sigh.however, i have come to notice that SD novels are very formulaic. i mean, i get it - if it aint broke, dont fix it. and even though i have grown to a certain level of comfortability with her stories, i kind of wish she would break the trend every once in a while. but she has a style and she does it well, so i cant really fault her for that.regardless, i think is probably my favourite story of hers so far. i really enjoyed all of the characters and the storyline. eli is freaking adorable. my gosh. i could have read a whole book about him. but i enjoyed how he helps auden make up for the childhood she missed out on. such a lighthearted story with a really meaningful conclusion and message. this is truly sarah dessen at her best!↠ 4 stars",167,4
5664985,Along for the Ride,Ali Goodwin,114,8209,3,"August 2, 2022",3.5 stars! This book was super cute and I loved how it was half romance and half coming of age/slice of life. The reason I gave 3.5 stars is because I felt like it moved a bit slow at parts. If the book was like 100 pages shorter I think it would be a 4 or 4.5 star read. Perfect summer read though! And I'm excited to watch the movie,105,N/A
5664985,Along for the Ride,the burning dreamer.,266,546,2,"December 24, 2016","And the award for my most vanilla book of 2016 goes to...I think I get it now. The whole appeal with Sarah Dessen and the million or so romance books she's churned; she's no Stephanie Perkins but reading her work is just so easy. Or at least this one was, my first one yet.But more than easy, it was boring. Mundane. Unexciting. VANILLA.Just like vanilla ice cream, it's enough to have me gobbling it up in one go, but doesn't quite manage to leave a satisfied mark like chocolate would. (Of course, this analogy is entirely redundant if vanilla happens to be your favourite flavour and you hate chocolate.) (In which case, WHAT ARE YOU?)In fact, let me add to that comparison: with Along For The Ride, I thought I ordered a nice, rich scoop of caramel, drizzled with hot fudge and whipped cream abound, but what I got instead was a $1 cone from McDonalds.I feel like this story held so much potential. Auden's personal problems dealing with family issues, social situations, insomnia, even as far as cycling (yes, I am 18 and only just learned how *insert gasp*)— they were all things I could directly relate to within some depth. And so I went into this hoping I could take away something profound, and if not, then learning things from a different perspective at the very least. No good book is a ""good book"" unless it leaves an impact on its readers some way or the other.But this? It did nothing for me. Absolutely nada, zero, zilch. Unless you count feelings of frustration over a wasted 6 hours and lost sleep as anything. The entire storyline boils down to having no important point to it at all and if it's meant to be a semi-inspiring ""coming of age"" novel, then it's done a gosh damn shoddy job of it. The one tiny aspect that I did appreciate was the concept of how teenagers should be given the freedom to find their own niche, figure their own life out without the pressure from parents –or anyone else at all– to follow a certain path. Also, how appearances and gender stereotypes are a complete and total sham.Buuuut.While well-written, that message was lost amidst poor execution with a yawn-worthy plot and a ridiculously detached romance (seriously, I have more chemistry with the subject chemistry than these two do with each other and that's saying something).You're better off going to Ikea and shopping for furniture (something I missed in favour of reading this) than hopping along for this ride; that'd be more adventurous than Eli and Auden's late night adventures ever will be.Final rating: 1.5 stars_________________________Book song: Flume - Quirk_________________________",92,7
5664985,Along for the Ride,Cara,280,699,4,"November 23, 2022","This is pure Sarah Dessen. It's a comfort to read her work, because you know you are going to come away with something to think about. I'm afraid I didn't like this one as much as the others. It's because well... it feels a little like I'm reading the same story. Tons of others have mentioned it, but she seems to be sticking to a very strict formula. Which I wouldn't mind too much if the characters didn't seem so similar. They all are so reserved and issue driven. One of the reasons I think that it didn't work so magically in this one was because Eli (the love interest)doesn't get explored enough. He's dealing with some truly heavy stuff and we do see glimpses of vulnerability but it's not enough. Does that make sense?But  please  don't mistake my irks with it as a bad review for the book. I  love  Sarah Dessen's writing. Even though she tends to use the same storyline it works because she knows how to work it. One of the things I was thrilled to see was the subplot story of Auden's baby sister and her new stepmother Heidi. We don't see this relationship much in young adult books and it made me smile to see Dessen use her own life experiences and insert them in her writing. You know what they say, write what you know.As always the minor characters are pitch perfect. My favorites in this one were Maggie and Adam. Everything is always done so well: character development, dialogue, growth it's no wonder people love Dessen's work. All the symbols like the bike, quest, beach, are done in a way to make you get attached it to it so much, and think "" yeah I TOTALLY get that! "" By the way I thought the idea of going on a quest sounded  awesome  and was a real unique way of getting Auden and Eli to really connect. It was funny to see all the cameo appearances from people in previous books. The funniest being Jason (Macy's old boyfriend in the The Truth About Forever). Dessen should totally write a book about him. I appreciated the way Auden and Eli meet. Most of the time they seem to click easily, but it was a bit harder for them so that was a welcome change. I hated Auden's dad. What a selfish guy, but one of the main lessons of this book is that people can change. I want to mention all the minor characters (like always there is a lot going on) but I simply can't. You'll just have to delve into the pages yourself. Brilliant idea of setting a lot of the book at night. It gives the book and the conversations that extra special touch. Even though it was not one of my favorites do read it. It will make you look at growing up differently.Update: Guys they are coming out with a movie on Netflix!",64,20
5664985,Along for the Ride,Aj the Ravenous Reader,"1,005",1049,4,"April 4, 2018","3.5 stars 
  ”Maybe it’s true, and being a girl could not be about interest rates and skinny jeans, riding bikes and wearing pink. Not about any one thing, but everything.” 
Although the story was a bit slow, it was written nice and easy. I really liked the premise and the characterization of AudenShe grew up under the strict tutelage of her intimidating, condescending mother while her barely visible dad always manages to escape his daddy roles in the guise of perfecting his craft in writing. I don’t know which one I dislike more, her mom or her dad. I guess there’s no other way to put it. They both suck. I’d hate to be Auden and I clearly should be more appreciative of my parents.I could strongly connect with Auden’s poor social skills but only because I’m me. My mom is nothing like Auden’s mom. In fact, my mom might be one of the most sociable, affable mothers you’ll ever meet. You’ll probably wonder why one of her daughters turned up like me. I got the hang of it though when I reached my twenties. I’m still socially awkward but at least I’m perfectly okay with it. Gosh, how did I manage to twist this review and make it about me? Blame it to my poor social skills.So overall, Auden’s journey in rediscovering herself, rediscovering people, actually experiencing childhood (i.e. learning how to ride a bike), gaining friends and even a romantic interest, understanding her parents and learning to loosen up and do things just for fun in an entire course of one summer is a story I quite enjoyed. I may not be fully invested with all the characters but I was very much Along for the Ride.",53,8
5664985,Along for the Ride,Jeff,143,401,2,"November 26, 2017","Peoples, this book ain’t worth it.Number one: THERES NO PLOT. LITERALLY NONE. This author was all like, ‘oh let’s put a normal teenage girl who has low self esteem!’ AHEM.BASICALLY HOW ALL CONTEMPORARY NOVELS GO.And let’s not forget about that boy! Of course Dessen went for the typical approach. Meaning- BIKER DUDENow, see I thought it’d be some great guy who’s hot and sports a six pack and all..basically my dream guy in every book.DA HELL TO THE NO.This dude.......*restrains from wanting to strangle him*HE’S STUPID.HE HAS A FREAKING IQ OF A DAMN CHEETO PUFF.There’s just nothing to him!!He’s got the looks, everything else is just.....0_0.......And this leads to number two! ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE BORING. They just have no life to them whatsoeverAuden, (MC), gives no more than a crap on making friends, and like...is the next freaking Einstein at school tho.Eli...................the dumb biker dude -_-Her mom- an assholeHer dad- even more of an assholePEOPLES U CAN SEE WHERE IM GOING WITH THIS.And there I go, stupidly reading all 383 pages of useless nothing. -_-Number three- all stories go with problem and solution right?? Mostly.YAH NO, THERE AINT ANY IN THIS ONE.It’s just...this is girl, this is boy, now kiss. *hallelujah chorus*Me: *rips hair out*My friends, I’m warning you.DONT READ IT.",49,16
5664985,Along for the Ride,emma,"1,780",42600,3,"February 19, 2018","not the best sarah dessen, but, you know, not the worst.there's kind of an interesting exploration of feminism and female gender identity in here??? which is not exactly what you'd expect. like, when this book started out by describing the protagonist's mom with this paragraph: ""She was an expert on women in literature but didn't much like them in practice. Partly, it was because so many of them were jealous,"" going on to describe her unbeliiiiiieeeeevable intelligence, success, beauty, and rockin' bod. apparently, these are goddamn envy kryptonite to women everywhere.not a great start.but then the book takes a truly astounding number of pages to kinda...take down that way of thinking? very lightly. but like. a lot of this book works as a depiction of women who can be both smart and pretty, both sporty and girly, both intellectual and pink dress-wearing.it does so sloppily. and slowly. and maybe inconclusively?but it tries.unfortunately: still a boring-as-hell guy. still a boring-as-hell girl. but also female friendship! but also really terrible parents who maybe shouldn't have been redeemed? and also a whole lot about bikes, which is weird as hell.bottom line: i say again - not the worst dessen. but waaaaaaaaaay not the best.",38,4
5664985,Along for the Ride,Steph (Reviewer X),90,119,5,"January 28, 2009","Cross-posted from my 
  blog review
. Auden is your classic overachiever: she’s studious and entirely too serious. What’s more, she deprived herself of a normal high school experience—one with friends and fun—opting instead for the academic route. Which did indeed work, because she got into a great university, the one she’d be attending come August. In the meantime, there is the whole summer stretching before her, and suddenly, spending it at home with her holier-than-thou, my-feminism-is-better-than-yours, literary professor of a mother and her revolving door of grad student flirts, dinner parties and drinking isn’t cutting it. So, Auden decides to spend summer in Colby (this isn’t set in Lakeview!) with her father, her stepmother Heidi (whom her mother deems a waste of space because of her girly tendencies), and their newborn Thisbe (her father is also a literary snob).She isn’t sure exactly what to expect in Colby, but it’s definitely not what she finds: a hookup she stupidly stumbled upon, her father immersed in his novel and not paying any heed to Heidi and the ever-crying Thisbe, Heidi’s imminent breakdown, or the job she inadvertently falls into, keeping the books for Heidi’s shop, Clementine’s. With the job come three girls—the other employees—who’re everything her mother stands against: girly and frivolous. Set in her snobby (and shy) ways, Auden secludes herself from the group and works diligently in the back room.However, she can’t keep hiding away forever. She doesn’t sleep at night, and neither does this strange guy Eli she keeps seeing around. One thing—Eli’s help in placating Thisbe in the middle of the night while Heidi catches up on some sleep—leads to another—seeing Eli at a party—and they become night buddies, embarked in a quest to give Auden a second chance at the childhood she never had, one food fight at a time.As the summer progresses, Auden aggregates herself to the trio from Clementine’s, faces the errors of her prejudice toward people influenced by her mother, and basically examines her entire life up to that point. The summer is, quite simply, a Renaissance.Auden’s character resonated with me. Like her, I’ve changed school multiple times (seven, if memory serves) and that’s made me feel like I’ve missed some crucial school experiences and rendered me socially retarded. Granted, I hide it a lot better than she does (seriously), but the underlying insecurity is much the same. Also, her prejudice toward “fluffy” girls is something I’ve faced as well, as was her discovery of substance beyond the pink exterior. This is terribly realistic stuff for us self-absorbed teens who figure we know everything and are always the smartest in the room.Which brings me to the characterization: Sarah Dessen is quite accomplished at possibly every facet of writing and storytelling, but I believe her true forte is her characters. Even Thisbe, Auden’s newborn half-sister, had personality. I loved how all important characters had layers upon layers that continuously surprised me, the reader. Reading this book was a peeling-the-onion experience, to be sure.Another thing I love in Sarah is that she doesn’t write about foreign—futuristic or fantastical—worlds but rather about the one in which I reside, and yet her world building is so adept, rich, filled with detail, that I can’t help but lose myself in it. In the hands of another writer, her books would probably be half their size and probably still be good (I love her familiar-yet-foreign approach to plotting universal situations in an unique way), but wouldn’t come alive as they do with her mastery of setting me in the mood and atmosphere.And finally, I love that this is a smart read. Aside from having smart-sounding content (Auden is, after all, an ambulant brain), the book itself is smart in that it’ll probably identify with each person in a different way. I identified with Auden’s alienation and her awakening to the people around her, but with the number of other things going on, I’m sure other parts will speak louder to other people. Her dysfunctional family situation, the unresolved divorces, the overall complicated nature of each troubling aspect of the book… Quite frankly, like with Laurie Halse Anderson, I wonder where Sarah Dessen gets so much experience with such an array of different topics to write about them with such bang. It’s downright formidable, the skill these two possess.Now, ironically, given the book’s subject matter, I read this one during one of my insomnia episodes. In fact, it’s 7:52 a.m. as of writing this sentence, and I just had breakfast and sat down to write this review. I’ll be going to sleep soon as I finish it, quite satisfied at that, because this book turned an otherwise destined to be useless night, exciting, interesting, and memorable. (Which is more than I can say about all the others, considering I can’t even distinguish one from another…)I have to say, though—and this is one of my only (minor) objections to something in this book—I’m not sure if insomnia is exactly what Auden has. She has a general discomfort with sleeping at night (explained in the book), but insomnia is the inability to sleep, even if given the opportunity. She just drinks loads of coffee to snap out of it. There’s a difference, and believe me, as an insomniac, I envy the people with the choice.Anyway.Sarah Dessen is definitely on an uphill climb of quality. She is one of those authors I am damn near worshiping and would die if I had the opportunity to interview or something. Counting this one, I’ve loved her last three books, each successively more than the other. I didn’t think she’d be able to top Lock and Key—which is second only to This Lullaby, as far as I’m concerned—anytime soon, but she did with this one. Her work—particularly at its best—is the kind that inspires me, moves me, even in the bleakest (or most boring, as was the case) of scenarios. Definitely required reading.",37,11
5664985,Along for the Ride,Sloan,21,61,5,"June 11, 2013","In my opinion, Sarah Dessen is one of the best young adult writers out there today. This book happens to be my second favorite book from her. It's odd how Dessen can make you feel like you know her characters personally. I love that about her writing, because she makes it so easy to identify with her characters. When I finished this book, I was almost upset about it. I didn't want to leave behind the characters and in some ways I felt like I was saying goodbye to friends. That’s a true sign that you've just read a really great book. Overall I give this a 4.5/5 stars!",35,6
5664985,Along for the Ride,Kristi,"1,188",2893,4,"June 23, 2009","I’m just going to start this out saying that I love Sarah Dessen. Along for the Ride is definitely on my Dessen all time favorite list. Right up there with Just Listen and This Lullaby. The characters is this novel are freaggin fabulous! That is one thing I can always count on with Dessen, she knows how to create a believable and relatable character no matter the situation. And Auden is no exception. I reveled in her transformation throughout the story. Ultimately that’s what this story was a bout for me, some people might see it as a love story, but for me is was a story of transformation.Even though I’ve read almost every novel Dessen has written, it still surprises me how engrossed I can become in the atmosphere and settings that she creates. I mean the places she writes about are often based on actual places, but she has a knack for making them rich and enticing places. I mean a coffee place in the back of a laundromat, with pie! How ingenious is that! I’ve read people complain about how every Dessen book is the same, and to some extent I agree with them. They follow similar plot lines, but each individual story is unique in it’s own way. I’ve never felt the same emotionally with any of her novels. She’s a spectacular writer. I’d love to see her do a male pov. Along for the Ride is outstanding and it’s a great summer read! ",33,6
5664985,Along for the Ride,♥ Becky  22 ,161,260,5,"July 9, 2013","I love you, Sarah Dessen!""Along For the Ride"" is about a girl called Auden, who just finished high school and is spending the summer before college visiting her dad and his new wife and newborn baby in their beach town. Auden has insomnia and spends her nights aimlessly driving around, until she meets Eli, who also can't sleep at night, and they start hanging out together. This is the PERFECT book for reading at the pool or the beach. One of my favorite 'summer-feel' books. 
  
""That was one of the things about the night. Stuff that would be weird in the bright light of day just wasn't so much once you passed a certain hour. It was like the dark evened it all out somehow.""""The night changed things, widening out the scope. What we said to each other, the things we did, they all took on a bigger meaning in the dark.""

  
  
I love how this book encourages you to be ALL THE THINGS. Just because you're girly and like the color pink, doesn't mean you're dumb. I feel like that's a stereotype many people have about girls. ""Who says you have to be either smart or pretty, or into girly stuff or sports? Life shouldn't be about the either/or. We're capable of more than that, you know?""""Maybe it was true, and being a girl could be about interest rates and skinny jeans, riding bikes and wearing pink. Not about any one thing, but everything.""I loved this book, and I absolutely recommend it. But read it in the summer. ;)",32,5

5664985,Along for the Ride,Elizabeth,273,726,1,"September 16, 2019","The problem with Sarah Dessen's books is not that she uses the same formula in every single one. That's fine! She's good at it, people like it - what one can do one must do, etc., etc.No, the problem is that she uses the same deadass doorknob of a female protagonist every single time. Auden is Annabel (Just Listen) is Ruby (Lock and Key) is Caitlin (Dreamland). They are ALL. The same. And my God, they are boring as hell.Auden, by far, is the deadest doorknob of them all. She is about as exciting as a laundry basket full of dirty clothes. She is actually paint. Drying on a wall. She is a soulless corpse. She is nothing. I am tired of reading about these boring AF girls who everyone seems to find interesting and mysterious and unlike anyone else they've met. It's not real. You cannot just walk around without a personality and have people enjoy your company.The actual story doesn't really exist. At least not in the couple hundred pages I've read so far. Auden has terrible parents blah blah she feels pressured blah blah whatever. I'm asleep. The love interest this time around is also exceedingly dull and there is less than zero chemistry between them. The only common ground they share is their identities as outcasts (which they have GIVEN THEMSELVES FOR NO. REASON. PEOPLE LIKE THEM. PEOPLE WANT TO TALK TO THEM. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU AN OUTCAST) and their insomnia. SARAH, staying awake all night and sleeping through most of the day doesn't make you an insomniac, it makes you nocturnal. Or a teenager. And it certainly doesn't make someone unique or intriguing. AUGH. I've been DNFing books left and right this year and I promised myself I would try not to do it again unless it was absolutely necessary but eff that. This is drivel and I'm over it.",26,8

Question: What are your favorite YA contemporaries to reread? I'm in desperate need for recommendations.I am seeking comfort in old YA contemporaries that brought me too much joy in summer. just reading the synopsis for this book was like an instant hit of joy. I could hear an echo of the 2013-2014 bops that were playing on the radio when I read these summer books. This quarantine is hitting harder than I thought without my local library to take comfort in weekly. I’m pulling out the big guns with these YA contemporaries. Morgan Matson is next, I feel it. I just recalled the little races I had with myself when reading these contemporaries. I wanted to fly through them because there was a whole list of books just like it left to discover. There’s no rereading. There’s only reading with fresh eyes, waiting to be amazed. I miss that.Why is that only YA contemporaries from the past can hold me glued to the page like they did back in the day? And get this, I’m actually excited to read them and get back to them. I haven’t experienced that in so long. It’s like only a specific group of books that can get me committed to reading. and I’ll hold on to any momentum as long as it gets me off that wicked refresh button on the youtube homepage. e n o u g h. this quarantine made me finally confront just how much time I let myself waste online. I want to read. Right now, this is the only thing I want to read. So I’ll read it. I have a whole lot more to say, but in short, Sarah Dessen books just hit different. Join me along this journey into the past.
