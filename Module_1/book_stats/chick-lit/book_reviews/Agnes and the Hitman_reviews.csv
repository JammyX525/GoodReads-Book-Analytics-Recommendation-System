384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Jilly,"1,838",6209,3,"August 31, 2019","I'm still on the fence about Jennifer Crusie's books. They ride a very fine line between hilarious and hectic & stupid. There are always tons of characters and some of them are hard to tell apart because the names and personalities are similar or generic. It's like the Broadway show ""Cats"". Do I like this? Or, am I extremely annoyed right now?Funny? Yes.Annoying? Also yes.There is zero believability as well. If you are like me, you will become frustrated because of this. It's really better if you check your brain at the door. A lot more fun is had by that method. As a matter of fact, as I often tell my kids who are smarter than they should be: Stupid people are happier. Intelligence makes you depressed. Sorry for the brains and all.I also did this to them:So they were doomed to be smart and miserable.Okay, so Agnes is a food columnist and writes cookbooks. She also has anger issues and has done a lot of court-ordered therapy. She has a tendency to hit her fiance's with a frying pan. Yes, more than once. For some reason, someone is trying to either kidnap her dog or kill her. It's not clear which one. So her adopted uncle decides to send her a bodyguard in the way of a hitman named Shane. I guess if you want to catch a killer, you need to be the killer. Or whatever.Um... yeah, sure. That's deep, dude.(see what I mean about dumb people? This guy looks really happy, doesn't he?)Along with all of the murder attempts, Agnes has to put on an amazing wedding at her house in a few days or she will lose her home. (Yeah, like I said - complicated). There is a villain who is trying to stop the wedding from happening because then she gets to steal Agnes' home. The villain is very OTT.There is a LOT going on in this story. It will make you tired. But, it was still funny and entertaining, so overall I liked it.",69,13
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Algernon (Darth Anyan),"1,461",926,4,"November 22, 2017"," To Do List, she thought. Feed cast of thousands, several of whom are killers and one of whom is an underage dognapper now living illegally in my barn. Plan flamingo wedding. Remember not to screw hitman's brains out again even though he's really hot. Find nice normal guy without gun permit. [...]Take revenge on the sleazy bitch who's trying to swindle me out of my dream house,It was going to be a very busy day.This is screwball comedy at its best, a very entertaining surprise for my summer read list, a real page turner mixing home cooking, anger management, marriage, murder, sex and a shit-ton of dirty money in a highly improbable plot that 'cooks' together two genres (steamy romance and mob crime) from two new authors for me (Jennifer Crusie and Bob Mayer). Hollywood, desperate lately for original stories, should pay attention to this homage to the classic zany comedies with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn. The heroine, spunky red-headed cook and blogger Agnes, makes a reference to another favorite movie of mine that has a similar vibe: ""Like John Cusack in Grosse Pointe Blank"" If this book doesn't make you laugh out loud with its scandalous repartees, you're a proper Grinch and I will strike you out from my Christmas card list ;-)Peace!",48,5
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Kelly (and the Book Boar),"2,393",7244,2,"March 6, 2020","Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/2.5 StarsJennifer Crusie is an author that one of the nicest people I work with is constantly recommending to me. Allow me to do what I do and use some gifs to explain the difference in our personality types. If we were Disney princesses, she would be . . . . 
  
And I would be . . . . 
  
I just assumed my reaction to her go-to-gal would be . . . . 
  
But then she finally wore me down and I gave Bet Me a chance and it was pretty alright so when she said this one was real good I decided it was worth the gamble. I mean, a leading lady who got her money by writing a cookbook featuring a mobster, her potential romantic interest being a hitman, a dead dognapper and a missing diamond necklace and possible five million additional bucks? What could go wrong? Well . . . . . 
  
Seriously, that‚Äôs the gripe. This book shouldn‚Äôt even be 300 pages, let alone over 400. It‚Äôs full of over-the-top, zany, slapstick antics that make for a fun time when confined to a low page count. The longer it went, the more I felt like I was on an old Hanna-Barbera loop. Are you old enough to know what that means???? If not, it goes a little something like so . . . . . 
  
At some point it became exhausting.",44,15
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Anna,145,114,5,"January 10, 2022","Agnes and the Hitman is a story about a cranky food columnist falling in love with a government hitman sent by his mobster uncle to protect her from several assassination attempts, while also trying to throw her goddaughter a flamingo wedding and keep her bridge from collapsing and her dog from being taken by crazy guys from the swamp. Sound bonkers? You haven‚Äôt even begun to make sense of this.Things you can find here:‚Äì A random guy being eaten by a crocodile;‚Äì A Spiritual Humanist cleaner (of dead bodies);‚Äì Grand gestures;‚Äì A secret underground bunker;‚Äì Kissing scenes written by Jenny Crusie, which is honestly all the incentive you should need.In fact, I think this quote explains how crazy this book is the best: ‚ÄúTo Do List, she thought. Feed cast of thousands, several of whom are killers and one of whom is an underage dognapper now living illegally in my barn. Plan flamingo wedding. Remember not to screw hitman‚Äôs brains out again even though he‚Äôs really hot. Find nice normal guy without gun permit.‚ÄùSpoiler: she doesn‚Äôt find a nice normal guy without a gun permit. üòèI love this book so much. The author is such a master at writing female characters who don‚Äôt conform to regular heroine standards. Agnes is really fucking angry in this one, and she unapologetically bashes some people over the head with her frying pan, and it's FINE!Shane is also so great; he‚Äôs just trying to keep Agnes alive/keep her from killing anyone. The romance is sizzling and the web of mob mysteries is fantastic. This is a laugh-out-loud book and rereading it is always such a joy. ‚ù§Ô∏è",37,8
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Woman Reading ,419,253,4,"August 28, 2021","almost 4 ‚òÜHumor is idiosyncratic as the reviews for Agnes and the Hitman indicate. Rarely do I see the top 10 reviews for a novel represent every point on the rating spectrum. Jennifer Crusie, usually a writer of romantic comedies, collaborated with Bob Mayer, who frequently pens military thrillers. It may look like an unconventional pairing, but I found this team effort to be more entertaining than Crusie's Getting Rid of Bradley, which had a similar feel. If you've enjoyed movies like ""Grosse Pointe Black"" (1997) or ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"" (1993), then I believe that this tale of madcap murderous mayhem will be equally fun for you. 
  
    ""Agnes, you're curious and fascinating and wonderful. You should probably not stab anybody with a meat fork again, but why be nice when you can be Cranky Agnes..."" Lisa Livia slapped her hands on the table. ""... Stop pretending you're normal. You're insane. Make that work for you.""
  
Food writer Agnes Crandall is hard at work organizing a wedding to be held in five days in her garden gazebo at the riverside home that she and her fiance Taylor purchased four months ago. The seller, Brenda, had included an interesting clause in the purchase contract. If Agnes and Taylor, a chef, can successfully host the ceremony for Brenda's granddaughter, then the mortgage payments for the first three months will be forgiven. If the new homebuyers fail, however, then the property, including their down-payment, will revert to Brenda's ownership. Hmm, what could possibly go wrong?
  
    ""There's nobody I'd go to faster in a crisis, but you are nuts. And not in a cute way. You have been since I met you.""Agnes looked at her stunned. ""I was fourteen when I met you.""Lisa Livia nodded, chewing omelet. ""And everybody in that damn boarding school was scared of you. You know what the first thing they told me was? Don't make Agnes mad."" 
  
Well, her ""Uncle"" Joe stepped in before Agnes could work up to a good level of ""mad,"" and he summoned his nephew Shane to return home and help his ""little Agnes."" Not that it mattered that Shane was in the middle of a job that necessitated disabling bodyguards and other things to reach his target. The GR synopsis was accurate, but IMHO it also revealed too much of the plot. The pace was hectic from the get-go which made the story a bit of a hot mess until I got all of the characters straight. But I didn't mind because the zaniness kept making me laugh. This plot was silly, sure, yet surprisingly complex. The comic tone had been established at the beginning, and I just rolled with it. And I was amused until probably the final ten percent. My only quibble with this novel was in the resolution of one of the character arcs because it was pretty outlandish, even for this novel.",29,10
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Dianne,"1,525",117,5,"June 27, 2022","Agnes and the Hitman by Jennifer CrusieOut of all the books that Jennifer and Bob have written together, I have to tell you THIS one is the only one I think is worth reading. Not only reading once but also re-reading repeatedly! I don‚Äôt know how many times I have re-read this book, and I‚Äôm still as in love with the story and the characters as I am the very first time I read it!This is a sexy, funny, mysterious read and a bit of a roller-coaster ride. This is a story containing major deceptions, weddings, food, murder, frustrations, obsessions, the ‚ÄòMob‚Äù, hope and out and out hate. Agnes Crandall is a food writer and wields a mighty frying pan. Sometimes that frying pan is used for purposes other than it was intended; like whacking someone over the head if they tick Agnes off. Perhaps this is one reason why she is known in the newspaper business as ‚ÄúCranky Agnes‚Äù.Shane is asked by his Uncle to come back and watch over his ‚ÄòLittle Agnes‚Äù after someone tries to dognap her bloodhound and accidentally gets killed in the process. Shane is a hit man, but who does he work for? And how much does he owe his Uncle and just why is his next hit apparently in the same town as Agnes? What is his boss Wilson hiding?The team of Cruise and Mayer‚Äôs write flawlessly speaking in two voices, yet written so subtlety that I am still not sure as to who is writing what. The characters, ALL of them, are fully fleshed and grow during the telling of the story. The story itself has a lovely flow to it combining the best of comedy and mystery. Those who deserve the ‚Äòhappily ever after‚Äô get one and the characters that don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶well you‚Äôll just have to read the book",27,2
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Wendy,"1,047",13,5,"April 12, 2008","I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! I enjoyed Crusie/Mayer's first book Don't look back as well but this was better. Agnes and Shane were wonderful. Just enough baggage and angst to keep the chemistry lively. I thought the supporting cast of characters was awesome. My favourites being LL and Garth. I wouldn't class this as a mystery or romance but there is enough of both to satisfy readers of both genres. I would call this a 'fun' read. It was great. Can't wait for the next one. Ppl should read this for what it is - 'a fun romantic romp.' Cos then they will enjoy it rather than pick it to pieces. There are bits that could be picked to bits if one was looking closely, but why would you want to. I laughed out loud in places and IMO that's gotta be good.Closed the book with a grin, and read it in one sitting. Both indications of a thoroughly enjoyable book. ",25,5
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Robin,"1,670",59,5,"August 26, 2022","Agnes Crandall has her work cut out for her. She and her fianc√© have recently purchased the home of her best friend's mother, wanting to turn it into a wedding venue. Part of the purchase agreement was having her goddaughter's wedding at the property. With just five days left until the wedding, things are not looking good. When a gunman breaks into her house and tries to kill Agnes, her ""Uncle Joe"" sends her help in the form of a hitman named Shane. The next things she knows, Agnes is facing dog-nappers, a cancelled flower order, a series of hitmen, a cheating fianc√©, elderly mobsters, a moody bride, pink flamingos, and a grandmother of the bride who wants to make sure the wedding never takes place. Shane has his own problems. His boss has given him a target to take out, but his mind is on the quirky lady who is planning this wedding.This book was just plain FUN! It took me a couple of chapters to sort out all of the characters and their relationships, but it was worth hanging in there. Agnes wasn't your typical heroine. She is smart, independent, and sometimes violent. She and Shane make a good team. The story itself is a wild ride. I never knew what was going to happen next or when the next dead body would pop up. My rating: 4.5 Stars.",19,6
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Rayne ‚ô•,197,89,1,"April 18, 2021","This was so boring. I felt like falling asleep about a million times. There is no suspense nor excitement in this book. It's generic (though it has a unique concept) and the characters are so 1 dimensional it hurts to read about them. I also hate how there's two POVS, WHY CAN'T I EVER FIND A GOOD ROMANCE BOOK WITH ONE POV? Sometimes multiple POVS can be good, but in this case, it's not. It doesn't add anything to the story and the guy's POV was like reading a cliche & corny action novel with an annoying male lead who has issues with his parents (in this case, his uncle). The romance was just annoying, like the characters, and I found Agnes's reasoning for literally anything quite absurd. She's just the epitome of a Mary Jane, except, with no moral compass (and not even in an interesting way). This a book full of cliches, 1 dimensional characters, and bad romance masquerading as a ""unique"" novel. I'd definitely pass on this one. instagram | goodreads",19,N/A
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Allison,545,566,4,"March 2, 2017","This book was a pleasant surprise. It's a great mix of chick lit and suspense. Full of murders, cooking, mobsters, and wedding prep - a combo that worked, believe it or not, and gave me plenty to chew on, keeping track of it all. It even earned a few chuckles from me - which is not easy, since I hardly ever get things that are supposed to be funny. ",19,1 comment
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Bonnie,"1,370",918,5,"November 15, 2015","The StorylineAgnes is not your normal chick-lit heroine. The fact that she‚Äôs known as ‚ÄòCranky Agnes‚Äô could give you an idea. The fact that she‚Äôs used a frying pan in more ways than just cooking (I‚Äôll give you a hint, one guy now has a metal plate in his head) could also give you another idea. There‚Äôs also an incident with a meat fork but I won‚Äôt spoil the fun for you. Or maybe it‚Äôs the mental conversations she has with her therapist.‚ÄùFuck you,‚Äù Agnes said, bent over the edge of the cake.Angry language, Agnes.Fuck you, too, Dr. Garvin.I think it‚Äôs a combination of everything, actually.Agnes leads a quiet, simple, life as a food writer engaged to a quiet, simple man named Taylor.

Her life is soon thrown into even more upheaval when a hitman, Shane, is sent to protect her. People keep coming after Agnes, trying to steal her dog, trying to kill her, but who‚Äôs sending them? What follows is a rollercoaster ride that‚Äôs entirely way too much fun.""Somebody might be coming to the house who might be dangerous.""""Really?"" Agnes said. ""Because that almost never happens here. With advance notice. Should I get my frying pan?""Final ThoughtsAgnes is going down as one of my favorite book characters of all time, definitely. She‚Äôs a single girl, who loves to cook for her friends, she‚Äôs preparing to hold a wedding at her house, and she‚Äôs a food writer‚Ä¶ I mean, at face value she‚Äôs just a normal girl. Agnes cannot be taken at face value and that‚Äôs what I loved most, the fact that I was completely surprised at how crazy and lovable she was all at the same time. This book was downright hilarious, was extremely enjoyable, the characters were all amazing (I especially loved Shane), and‚Ä¶ why exactly have I never read anything by this author before? Will definitely be correcting this, pronto. ",17,N/A
384457,Agnes and the Hitman,Marie,33,4,5,"December 10, 2011","**5++++ stars**Have you ever read a book that you finish but within 2-4 days you are ready to read it again? This is that book for me. I have loved several books in my lifetime. This book was easily one of my favorite books ever.I think between the humor, violence, humor again, romance, friendships, minor characters, and even the dog, between it all I fell in love with this book. Agnes is a cookbook author. She also has a column about cooking titled Cranky Agnes. She is armed and dangerous, with a frying pan. Shane is a hitman, simple as that. He swoops in and helps his Uncle Joey keep Agnes safe although she does a pretty bang up job of that herself. I adore Shane because of how he treats Agnes. Something about a guy respecting a woman that gets me. This story had me so enthralled I was screaming at the characters to just whack someone over the head by the end. There is a wedding, the mob, government agencies, strays, and revenge. This isn't a mystery so to say but it had enough to make me reading just to find out what really happened! It's like those alternate endings in the Clue movie. That's how I felt for a while.(Similar too how I felt reading Crusie's Faking It at the end.) I say if you want to meet a funny set of characters and even fall in love with the minor ones then pick this book up. I loved it. I will be reading it again shortly. ",14,N/A
