3463,A Bend in the Road,Sharon,946,182,4,"March 30, 2020","Sheriff Miles Ryan is a single father to nine year old Jonah. Two years ago Miles’s wife was killed and ever since he has been obsessed with finding out who was responsible for the hit and run which ended his wife’s life and his son without a mother. When Miles learns Jonah is having difficulty at school, he meets with his teacher Sarah Andrews. Together they discuss the best way to help Jonah through the struggles he is experiencing whilst at school. Whilst helping Jonah Miles and Sarah begin to have feelings for each other and in time their laughter turns to love, but when a secret is uncovered could their feelings for one another change?Nicholas Sparks is a well known author and his books are enjoyed by many including me. He has a way with words that when you’re reading his books you get a total understanding of the story and you become emotionally invested. What more could a reader need or want in a book? I thoroughly enjoyed this book and have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone who loves reading.",55,2
3463,A Bend in the Road,M. M. Sana,77,14,5,"April 27, 2007","This is an awesome book. It has a little bit of romance and a little mystery. It will embed images in your mind that will be hard to escape. Love and forgiveness will have a new meaning in your life. Yes, it does have a little bit of everything. A husband's love, a father's love, a cop in action, romance, mystery... FORGIVENESS! I won't tell you what it is about, because I think you should read it. REALLY!!! Go get it and read it. I never thought a man could write LOVE so well. Love in its purest form.",46,7
3463,A Bend in the Road,zainab ,121,34,2,"May 8, 2022","Miles Ryan lives with his son Jonah in a small town in North Carolina. For two years Miles has been suffering from the sudden death of his wife Missy. Jonah's teacher, Sarah, seems to wake Miles up. But Sarah brings the past under a very different light and maybe Miles can put his past behind him after all. This book was a bit of a hurdle for me. I didn't read it in one sitting, but took a little break because it didn't pull me in. It is a good book by Sparks, but I have read better ones by him. At the beginning it still excited me, but it always goes the same way, the same quarrels and the end, I knew before it even came to the topic......",43,N/A
3463,A Bend in the Road,Caroline,184,12,1,"February 3, 2008","Surely the Danielle Steele set must rejoice whenever Sparks churns out a new book. While this was not the worst Sparks book I've ever read (there, I've admitted it - I've read more than one), that is a pretty low bar. I cannot even believe I read this. Not only do I not remember why I picked this book up, I cannot remember the ending. Suggestion: skip this book and save a few hours of your life; put it to good use gardening, playing with your children, or better yet, choosing a good author who doesn't insult your sensibilities with his writing.",35,14
3463,A Bend in the Road,Buggy,482,676,4,"July 19, 2011","Opening Line: “On the morning of August 29, 1988, a little more than two years after his wife had passed away, Miles Ryan stood on the back porch of his house, smoking a cigarette, watching as the rising sun slowly changed the morning sky from dusky grey to orange.”Nicholas Sparks is like comfort food, I always know going in the kind of emotional love story I’m going to get and I can count on being sucked into the lives, loves and heartache of his small town characters. They’re written realistically, I mean I feel like I know them, flaws and all and I usually want to move to whatever town it is he’s describing. Sure sometimes the stories are predictable and I find that the couple de jour spouts the “I love you’s” too soon for my liking or realism’s sake but still his stories are always a pleasure to read, which is what keeps me coming back for more.A BEND IN THE ROAD was a surprise in that it keeps a sense of mystery going throughout, often leaving the main couples love story and allowing us into the mind of the anonymous “bad guy”. Slowly unravelling their story until the shocking big reveal at the end. I honestly didn’t know how Sparks was going to wrap things up here, his couples doesn’t always end up together and that too added to the mystery.Sheriff’s deputy Miles Ryan is still struggling to come to terms with the death of his beloved wife in a hit-and-run accident nearly two years ago. High school sweethearts, theirs was a love destined to last and Miles can’t seem to let go of the grief or the fact that as an officer of the law he’s been unable to find the person responsible. If it weren’t for their young son Jonah it’s unlikely that Miles would find the strength to get through the day. Which brings into play Jonah’s second grade teacher Sarah Andrews. When Jonah begins having trouble keeping up in school Sarah offers to tutor him and a tentative relationship begins to form. Sarah is running away from a bad divorce (is there a good one?) and has a few skeletons in her closet as well. Our couple fall in love pretty fast (from one page to the next) and are just beginning to see a real future together when Miles’ past comes back, tearing everything apart. Unwilling to let go of his dead wife and obsessed with finding her killer and ultimately closure I can honestly say that I was surprised by events I didn’t see coming. As I hinted at earlier I really enjoyed getting inside the head of the hit-and-run driver and slowly discovering who it was, becoming very sympathetic towards their situation. However I could have done without spending so much time running around with county sheriff Charlie and subsequently the middle parts of this story lagged. Still a recommended read. Cheers!",18,27
3463,A Bend in the Road,Alaine,288,83,3,"January 5, 2009","Some stories don't have happy endings and some do. This one of course can't really have a happy ending because a wife and mother have died. But, this book tells the story of a man's journey through grief, and anyone who has been through the loss of a loved one knows that the pain never ends. Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job of reminding us of that, it was not a week love story, someone dies, someone else comes along and they live happily ever after. Instead it spoke clearly of the struggle and inner turmoil of a man wanting to get on with his life but never really being able to let go. He had the flashbacks and constant memories that we all have when going through grief. This aspect of the book was excellent and could not be faulted.Whilst I loved the character of Sarah I struggled to make that emotional connection to Miles. For me I found him to be a little bit of a typical macho kind of guy and that at times annoyed me. I will say however that it is possible that I had this issue because I listened to this book on audio and sometimes the droning of characters can get on your nerves. This is however the reason I gave the book a rating of 3 (although, it would be 3 1/2 if it where possible) and not higher, I just didn't fall in love with the main character the way that I wanted to.",17,3
3463,A Bend in the Road,Ashley,482,213,3,"April 22, 2019","Reviewed on: Ashes Books & Bobs.My friend, Megan and I decided to do a Nicholas Sparks reading marathon this month and as I was checking my Goodreads to see which of his books I’d yet to read, A Bend in the Road showed up. I decided to start there only to quickly discover I had read the book before, long before I started tracking my reading with Goodreads.Nicholas Sparks was the author to introduce me to the romance genre. I used to read his new books religiously when they came out because he was the only one I knew who could create love stories to give me all the mushy-gushy feels I had grown to love. The North Carolina settings always seemed cozy and welcoming, the characters were loveable, and there was just enough drama to keep it interesting.Rereading this book made me realize how much I’ve grown as a reader since my Nicholas Sparks superfan days. While his books feature all of the things I mentioned above, all things I still love, many of his books also feature lengthy descriptions of absolutely mundane daily details I don’t have the patience to read about anymore. As a younger reader, these details didn’t bother me, likely due to the fact that I wasn’t living a mundane adult life myself yet. These things were new and novel and added to the romanticism. Unfortunately, A Bend in the Road featured an abundance of mundane and I found myself skimming until I’d find a bit of action taking place again.Nonetheless, I’m glad I decided to start with A Bend in the Road, if only for the sake of nostalgia. In some ways, it was sad to see how much my reading tastes have changed but in other ways, I’m glad to see the growth I’ve experienced in life. I’m not stagnant and that’s a good thing.",15,4
3463,A Bend in the Road,Sneha Mary Henry,18,30,3,"May 25, 2020","This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have ever read and honestly it was just Okay!!!!I expected more from this novel by viewing its rating on goodreads but unfortunately, it wasn’t worth the hype.This novel revolves around the main character named Miles Ryan who lost his wife to a hit-and-run driver. It takes quite a while for Miles to bring himself out from its grief and gradually begins to think about starting a new life. That’s when he happens to meet Sarah Andrews, who is Miles’s son Jonah’s school teacher. Eventually they begin to develop feelings for one another and soon it blooms into a romantic relationship. However, things get complicated when Miles tries to find out the man behind the wheels who had run over his wife and killed her. He assumes it to be his antagonist Otis Timson. But, subsequently he learns the shocking truth that the driver was none other than Sarah’s brother Brian. These events messes up their relation and the story continues to be serious and kinda depressing.Well!! The first half of the novel was quite interesting but the second half just deprived to an average level. This is mainly because the character Miles has been portrayed as a sheriff and there are many turn of events where they talk about investigation regarding Miles’s wife Missy accident and criminal charges. Moreover, these scenarios got me wondering whether am I really reading a romance novel. Because this book was giving less of romance and more of a thriller vibe. However, the epilogue was kinda good because I believe it gave a satisfying ending to the story. Altogether, I liked the book but did not love it.",13,1 comment
3463,A Bend in the Road,Alaina,"5,907",216,3,"March 14, 2018","A Bend in the Road is a tragedy and a love story. Miles is the police sheriff who also happens to be a young widower. His wife died in a Hit and Run, which he and Jonah (his kid) are still trying to recover from and deal with. When Miles meets Sarah, Jonah's teacher, he starts to think he could find love again. However, not everything is easy for Miles because he's so obsessed with trying to find his wife's killer.. which could somehow put strain on his new and developing relationship with Sarah.This book was okay. I mean, I did get completely hooked by it because it is a Nicholas Sparks book.. and somehow this guy writes complete gold every now and then. It was pretty interesting until Miles go crazy.. and then it got weird (to me at least). Plus, every now and then you got a section or a chapter form the killer.. and the entire time I just wanted to know their name! The relationship between Sarah and Miles was okay. It didn't really blow me away or make me smile like a creepy person. The ending kind of felt rushed to me.. or it just seemed like Miles chose Sarah to make Jonah happier in the end? OR SOMETHING? I don't know.. I'm tired and I need coffee!!Overall, I liked the book. I guess I had higher expectations or just wanted more than what I got from this book. I'm glad that I read it. I wonder if I can read all of his books this year?? On to the next one!",12,N/A
3463,A Bend in the Road,Chipper,32,4,1,"January 28, 2010","This novel was like reading the Cliff Notes of a epic love story, MINUS the analysis and depth you might find in Cliff Notes and MINUS the well-developed and fascinating characters, settings and dialogue you might find in an epic love story. Based upon my reading of this book, nobody will be reading Nicolas Sparks 100 years from now and I refuse to waste any more of my limited time on Earth reading words slapped together by him and bound under the pretense of actually being a novel.The SECOND BEST thing about A Bend in the Road is that it was only 368 pages (with medium-large type) and it was over quickly. In spite of this, I'm still surprised I finished it. The few times I did put it down, I threw it down disgusted by his formulaic writing style, predictable plot lines and pathetic dialogue.The BEST thing about A Bend in the Road is that one month - maybe even one week - from now, I won't be able to remember a damn thing about it. No aspect of this book is memorable and essentially every aspect of it is utterly forgettable.",10,3
