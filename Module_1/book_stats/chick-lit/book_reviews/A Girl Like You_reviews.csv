Always leave them before they leave you.After being in a relationship for 7 years, Abigail is back on the market and completely lost. She doesn’t have a clue what she’s doing and starts taking dating advice from her womanising flatmate Robert. With these 6 tips in mind and a little help from her friends, she goes out into the dating world and acts like a dude. Apparently, this is the key to success. Everything is going very smoothly, she’s getting loads of male attention and she’s having so much fun... until she meets her match. Will she be able to keep her cool?I loved everything about this book. I loved all the characters (except the ones you’re supposed to hate, of course, but even those are hard to hate after a while) and I loved the storyline. It was very original. Just the idea of a woman trying to act like a man to get dates and having a womaniser helping her out every step of the way. The writing style was great, like Abigail was personally telling me the story, using sentences like ‘between you and me’ and stuff like that. I felt like she was really talking to me and it added to the reading experience. Even the swear words added to the story! Who doesn’t like the words ‘fucknuckle’, ‘cocksmoker’ and ‘cockmonkey’?The relationship between Abigail and Robert was the most adorable thing ever, even if they were just friends. Their constant banter; their effortless, comfortable friendship; their insults and jokes which had me laughing along with them. And then there were the sad parts where they had to look after each other and they cheered each other up. It all felt so natural and cute and that’s everything I want in a best friend (or a relationship for that matter). I could read about these two for ages, they were so much fun!I would recommend A Girl Like You to everyone who needs a good laugh and/or a light read. This one had me laughing out loud and grinning from ear to ear. This isn't ordinary chicklit. This is chicklit with balls.",67,11

You know 'em, you love 'em, welcome to the stage Nice Natalie and Cynical Natalie!Nice Natalie: It's been a while since we've been called upon to do a review.Cynical Natalie: Because Ms. Monroe was a lazy ass and didn't take notes. So now we have to do her dirty work.Nice Natalie: Oh, come now. It's only because she doesn't know what to feel towards A Girl Like You.Cynical Natalie: Well, I know exactly how I feel: Abigail deserves to burn in hell with Nora Grey and the rest of them. She's in her late twenties, but acts like a ditzy high-schooler. Nice Natalie: Becky from Confessions of a Shopaholic is immature too, but we love her. A lot of chick-lie heroines are like that; it makes them relatable.Cynical Natalie: Are you kidding me? I don't want to relate with her. I don't want to be the same species as her. She has no idea what the fuck she's doing. We're 21 and we have a better grasp on life than she does. Nice Natalie: For now. What happens when we graduate and can't find a job? Or hate our job? Abigail's situation resembles real life.Cynical Natalie: Whatever. And she keeps going on and on about Desperate Singleton. We spend so much educating women that getting a guy isn't the most important thing in life, and Abigail won't stop whining about it.Nice Natalie: Please, don't tell me you've never thought about Desperate Singleton. It's not anti-feminist to want a man. It is anti-feminist to stifle literature about different kinds of women, including those romance-based.Cynical Natalie: Yeah, but it doesn't mean I have to like. Look at the writing, for God's sake:
  ""I drew in a sharp breath, a bursting shocked feeling in my chest.""
Nice Natalie: Okay, fine, that's a bad sentence. But the rest of it is quite good.Cynical Natalie: Her inner monologues make me want to drown her, save her, then drown her again.Nice Natalie: Right... So 3.5 stars?Cynical Natalie: I repeat, her inner monologues made me want to drown her, save her, then drown her again. I'm not going above two.Nice Natalie: This isn't a poker game!Cynical Natalie: Like you know how poker works.Nice Natalie: Neither of us knows how poker works! Let's just mark it a three and call it a day.Cynical Natalie: 2.5.Nice Natalie: That's so mean!Cynical Natalie: Mean is my middle name. Now fold.Nice Natalie: STOP USING POKER REFERENCES!Cynical Natalie: Nice Natalie: FINE. But no putting it on top. And the star rating stays three.Cynical Natalie: Fine by me. For those of you still reading, it sucks.Nice Natalie: It really doesn't.Cynical Natalie: Let them decide who to believe: the honest, unapologetic reviewer?

9712341,A Girl Like You,Mona,10,5,5,"April 28, 2012","I cried. I don't wanna talk about it.I love this book. I LOL'd. I rolled around the bed one week so obsessed by the book by the time I finished reading it small rodents had settled into my hair and were debating expanding the nest to a small condo and I had gained 5 pounds from nibbling on whatever I came across in the house.(which, as nibblers know, is never good.)Again, I cried. I said I don't wanna talk about it, but it should be mentioned that they were happy tears. I don't often get happy tears. I get sad lots, but true joy? Oh yes, in this book.It was a lovely length. I don't like short chick lit (everything must be solved by chapter 6! and by chapter 10 she should be married!) no, no, none of that here. Just a straightforward plot which was (in all honesty) predictable, but thoroughly enjoyable nonetheless. Like walking into a scary house and expecting a spider to fall from the ceiling and instead having a net fall on you and you're on the floor gasping in fear and trapped while live tarantulas crawl up your leg. Exactly like that. Only funny and romantic.I had a few snags with the plot, but the characterization and romantic developments were fun. (One regret. As always, every time I walk away from a chick-lit book I find myself pawing through my wardrobe wishing I had a sense of style.)Would give to a fan of romance and believer in 'the one' since that's the theme this book pushes relentlessly. (but a good relentless. 'grandma-gives-me-too-much-chocolate-I'm-getting-fat' relentless.)",33,2
9712341,A Girl Like You,Delirious Disquisitions,428,179,5,"October 8, 2014","So I just finished reading this book...and after all the back pain,the countless hours of sleep deprivation,the dark circles under my eyes, I have finally finished it...and I just have to say...it was sssssssssoooooooo worth it!!I simply fell in love with the book and its characters. I loved the way the author wrote this book from the starting to the acknowledgements. It was simply brilliant!I loved,absolutely loved Robert! A guy who cooks,takes care of breakfast when you are late for work, who nurses you back to health, protects your virtue and faints at the sight of blood! A man so loving and just perfect! I loved him!I admired Abigail's resilience and thought there were times when my heart broke as a consequence of her actions (recall hotel room departure after they made love!!gasp!!!) I could relate to her. And last but not the least, I must say I loathed that absolute cow belle and her stupid boyfriend!!All in all an excellent book. A must read! ",23,1 comment
9712341,A Girl Like You,Jacob Proffitt,"2,848",1489,4,"May 1, 2014","This was a ton of fun, with an incredibly satisfying emotional payoff. The characters are well-drawn enough to evoke Cecelia Ahern (without the magical realism) with maybe a touch of Bridget Jones's Diary (though a very light touch).What makes the book work, for me, is that I just liked Abigail so much. She has been in emotional stasis for a long time and seeing her emerge, and mature, was just a whole lot of fun. Frankly, it's a bit brilliant to take an ignorant observer and thrust them into the dating scene with an experienced native (in this case, Robert). Abigail's exploration of dating as a former outsider is fascinating (as is Robert's often insightful guidance).And it doesn't hurt, of course, that Robert is such a fantastic guy. As an indication of exactly how much I liked him, he still came across as studly tooling Abigail around London on a moped. Hard to believe, I know...The book went a little long in the middle with Abigail's hang-up on the jerkwad jackwagon, Dave. I get a week with a popular, charismatic party guy. A month, maybe, with Abigail's inexperience. But three months? Gah. Yeah, she needed the contrast (maybe) to understand that she isn't as emotionally detached as she thought she was. And he serves as a wonderful contrast to the lovely Robert. Even so, I think a good deal of that length could have disappeared and maybe improved the book a bit in the process.That said, the culmination of the book, its emotional climax, was well worth the wait. I kept waiting for the cringe as the situation buildup was rather extreme and there were a lot of moving parts involved (with complex characters I cared about strewn about the scenery). But Burgess handled everything beautifully with a climax that flowed so well and naturally that tears actually flowed (yeah, that isn't that great an accomplishment with me).A note about editions: It looks like Avon originally published the book but that the author is the one with the eBook rights. As such, the two aren't actually linked so if you hit Amazon on the hard copy it doesn't link the kindle book from there (and vice versa). That may be the case in other retailers as well with such a complicated rights issue. The upside of this is that the Kindle version is extremely well priced for the quality of the writing. The author messed up, some, on the formatting with what looks like one dialog word globally replaced such that if the quote starts with it you just get a comma. Like this: "","" I say. It's a place-marker word, though (something like ""hmmm"" or ""m'kay""), so no real harm done.A note about Steamy: There's sex in the book, and a make out or two that get pretty hot, but Burgess cuts well before we get terribly explicit. It's just enough for me to flag as ""Steamy"" but on the lowest possible setting.",17,17

9712341,A Girl Like You,Renee,256,107,4,"September 21, 2016","A sweet light read. Heroine annoyed me a little at times, but THAT ENDING - Purrr-fect!",15,2
9712341,A Girl Like You,Didi,865,290,3,"February 12, 2014","~~~ 3 STARS OR 6/10 ~~~This is chick lit. I usually don't read chick lit. And aside from the last few chapters of this book, I don't think I want to again any time soon.So why did I read it?Well, for one, the premise sounded good and secondly, the reviews were stellar. I should have clued in that most of these reviews were from regular chick lit readers--there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not my preference. So FOR A CHICK LIT BOOK...this was good.I liked, no loved the ending. The last chapter pretty much made me cry. It was sincere and beautiful. The speech Robert(H) gave was heart melting and touching. So what didn't work? All the usual elements of a chick lit book:----- The romance was lacking. I know it was supposed to be the highlight of the story but it wasn't. Robert was supposed to feel a certain way about Abby, okay, I get that. But I'm not a mind reader. Aside from a few scenes in the last third, I would never think he had a thing for her. Even those instances before the glaringly obvious ones in the last few chapters left me feeling...HUH? SO YOU LIKE HER...RIGHT? I honestly think that since I'm used to more meat to a romance, more obvious sexual tension, more angst over a person you're supposed to be in love with....that I wasn't satisfied. Is the reader supposed to intuitively understand what's going through the heads of the main characters??---- the majority of the book was about Abby and her friendship dynamics coasting the treacherous waters of the dating world. It felt more about self discovery then finding your true love. And only in the last few chapters did I think...FINALLY! SOME SEXUAL TENSION! Where the story focused solely on Abby and Robert. Chick lit's tend to insert love interests in the most bizarre way leaving me feeling like I missed a few dozen chapters.----there was fade to black sexy time scenes. Did I mention I'm not a fan of that? Even the kissing was glossed over aside from letting me know it was splendid. The pivotal scene between Rob and Abby, which was supposed to be the breaking point should have been detailed but...NO.Of course Abby makes some stupid decisions, picks the wrong guy, before finally clueing in to the right one under her nose all along. But maybe, just maybe, she would have seen things sooner had a certain someone been more obvious. Apparently he was to all the characters in the book, this made me feel really dumb. How can everyone in the story see it except the reader??!!Anywho, like I said, a fantastic ending to an otherwise lacklustre story. I loved Robert and Abby together. They were best friends before the fireworks----apparently there the whole time, but don't ask me----and sweet together after all the crap was out of the way. If this was written as a slowly brewing love story I would have cried from joy. But it wasn't although it was?? Don't ask me! And lastly, do normal people drink that much?! Okay back to the romance I love! No more chick lit. I hope. NO MORE! I hope.",13,19
9712341,A Girl Like You,Jadaloves,126,3,5,"July 13, 2011","This book was so deliciously charming that I didn’t want to put it down. I was swept into London, and the quirky dating world of Abigail Wood and I enjoyed every minute of it. First off I just have to say I’m beginning to love overseas authors more and more. I’m especially loving novels set in London and surrounding areas, though I’ve never been. But the atmosphere just seems so divine and fun. This book was no different.Abigail was a great leading lady. After seven years in a blase relationship, Abigail finally realizes she doesn’t just want to accept the status quo and breaks it off with her longtime boyfriend. After moving in with her flatmate Robert, notorious ladies man, she begins to take his dating advice, which makes for some interesting adventures. She’s smart, funny, and adorably cute. I love how she embraces singledom and eventually learns to take charge and basically navigate her own dating life instead of letting things happen. I found myself cheering for her through her dating triumphs and becoming exasperated when she essentially forgot all of her ‘lessons’ after finding herself in a new relationship. The ups, the downs, they were all fascinating and satisfying.I also adored me some Robert. He appears to be very nonchalant and unaffected, but this guy has layers. He’s hilarious, kind, and observant. He and Abigail develop the most amazing friendship and I loved reading about it. I am a big proponent of love born out of friendship. He comes to know what Abby’s every face and sigh means. And she begins to understand that he’s much more than his reputation, and that people aren’t always who they appear to be. Eventually everyone can see how this story is going to end up except for Robert and Abigail. But reading about them getting there was the best part.Even the minor characters in this book were great. I loved Abby’s best friend Plum. She was too funny and always inappropriate. Her sister Sophie was sweet and kind, and her friend Henry was such a loveable dork. And the many other friends and acquaintances all add something unique to the story whether I liked them or not. This book was so well written with the perfect blend of crass and sass. Really this was just a beautiful story of true friendship and what can happen when you take a risk on something more. Overall, GREAT GREAT book and I recommend you pick it up. Can’t wait to read more from Miss Burgess. ",12,1 comment

Loved it! I could really relate to some things. I was stuck for years with ""Dave"" situation (not exactly the same, long story for another time) and this year I finally got him out of my life and my head I feel so much better. People that make you feel miserable and make you doubt yourself are like anchors. They drag you down, drain all your energy and and you're left with self doubt, regrets and emptiness. So yeah, get rid of them, even if you love them, it's the right thing to do. No one you love should make you feel like shit. Be who you want to be and don't change for anyone. And also don't wait for them to change. Take care of yourself.",11,3

This book made me laugh out loud and proud to love to read chick-lits. Calling all single ladies, you need to read this book! I feel us single ladies take our dating status as a mark of shame or punishment when we should be laughing more than crying of lack of men or horrid dates. Gemma Burgess makes dating life fun and laughable, which it is. She makes us women feel powerful, beautiful, and sexy, which we are. Plus, she gives some really good advice in this book.

I don't know why but I just knew as soon as I read this in the prologue that I was going to love this book. This turned out to be so much better than I had expected. I had just gone in thinking it would be a light quick read, and just another 3 star book. But oh no. This was one of the best light-read. I don't need to point out what aspects of this book I liked. It was, kind of, everything. If I had read this book just few months back I would've definitely given this a full (or even more than) 5 stars.Ugh, such great characters, everyone of them. I fell in love with each of them. (Except obviously, *whispers* the D) And there was not even a single point throughout the story where I got bored, especially for a long book like this. I was thoroughly invested.I'll just say it, I love good big books and I do not lie. (Writing all this in the metro on the way home and I'm just grinning widely remembering all the great moments from this book. Maybe that's why, you know, don't expect any structure in this review.)The synopsis does not do this book justice. Reading this book was like going on a journey. I never could imagine what would happen next and what beautiful things I would get to behold going forward. The greatest part though? ROBERT. I mean, one does not get better than that. He was unapologetically a slut, (and if you feel like it's a bad word, your fault. I personally use it as a neutral noun for a person open to having sex whenever. If your opinion differs, you're welcome to educate me in the comments), unimaginably handsome, funny, smart, and the best best-friend anyone could have. That last scene cemented my adoration of him, and I could've cried proud, happy tears due to love pouring out of me.Plus if all this wasn't enough, this book had one of the best love confession I have ever read. And we also see some of the characters growing throughout the story (so a yay! for dynamic characters) and it was like being witness to a flower budding. The end result was beautiful. There is no doubt in my mind that I will remember these characters and their story for a long time to come, and soon come back to get to know them again. I've very few times been this happy after finishing a book. Would recommend it to everyone having a bad day, or even otherwise.",8,N/A
9712341,A Girl Like You,Keertana,"1,126",2162,4,"July 16, 2014","A Girl Like You is classic, unapologetic chick-lit--and I love it. Newly single Abigail is entering the dating world for the first time. Now, having broken up with her boyfriend of far too many years, Abigail is determined to find the right guy. Robert, her new flat-mate and a classic player, is the perfect candidate to coach her on the Art of Dating. From the beginning itself, Abigail's narration is honest, unassuming, and drop-dead hilarious. It's impossible not to become entirely embroiled in this romance, particularly as we witness Abigail stumble through bad dates, make the walk of shame, and finally become a Dating Guru. Within months, she has all the single guys of London eating out of her hand...but she still hasn't found the one. If you've seen or read even a half-dozen chick flicks, you already know by now who the love interest is but the journey from friendship to romance is long, charming, and oh-so-endearing. Seriously, this book will have you in peals of laughter one moment only to have you clutching your abdomen in tension the next but I can guarantee you this: you'll close this book with the most languid, lazy, and satisfied smile.
