82747,Angels,Ellen,76,1 follower,2,"June 3, 2008","Disappointing. I have loved other Keyes novels, but this one is SLOW. Nothing happens, nothing happens, nothing happens for FAR too long, mostly because the main character doesn't want anything, so she's not trying to do anything, so you get endless descriptions of her pointless days of hanging out. It's quite a long slog through the middle part. And Keyes seems to think Los Angeles ""wackiness"" makes up for all that, but it does NOT. At the end it gets pretty good, but I'm frankly surprised I made it all the way to the end.",36,10
82747,Angels,Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*,"1,895",1993,2,"July 2, 2020","EXCERPT: I'd always lived a fairly blameless life. Up until the day I left my husband and then ran away to Hollywood, I'd hardly ever put a foot wrong. Not one that many people knew about, anyway. So when, out of the blue, everything just disintegrated like wet paper, I couldn't shake a wormy suspicion that this was long overdue. All that clean living simply isn't natural. Of course, I didn't just wake up one morning and skip the country, leaving my poor, sleepy, fool of a husband wondering what that envelope on his pillow was. I'm making it sound much more dramatic than it actually was, which is strange because I never used to have a penchant for dramatics. Or a penchant for words like 'penchant,' for that matter. But ever since that business with the rabbits, and possibly even before that, things with Garv had been uncomfortable and weird. Then we suffered a couple of what we chose to call 'setbacks.' But instead of making our marriage stronger - as always seemed to happen to the other luckier setback souls who popped up in my mother's women's magazines - our particular brand of setbacks did exactly what it said on the tin. They set us back. They wedged themselves between myself and Garv and alienated us from one another. Though he never said anything, I knew Garv blamed me. And that was okay, because I blamed me too. ABOUT THIS BOOK: Maggie has always been the white sheep of the Walsh family.Unlike her comically dysfunctional sisters,Rachel(heroine of Rachel's Holiday) and Claire (heroine of Watermelon), she married a decent man who adored her and found herself a solid career. Where Rachel was reckless and Claire dramatic, Maggie settled early for safety. Or so she believed until she discovers that her husband is having an affair and her boss is going to fire her. Suddenly, her perfectly organized life has become a perfect mess.Devastated, she decides the only thing to do is to run for the shelter of her best friend, Emily, who lives in Los Angeles. There, with the help of sunshine and long days at the beach, she will lick her wounds and decide where life will take her next.But from the moment she lands in the City of Angels, things are not quite what she expected. Overnight, she's mixing with movie stars,even pitching film scripts to studios.Most unexpectedly of all,she finds that just because her marriage is over,it doesn't mean her life is. In the end neither the City of Angels nor Maggie Walsh will ever be the same again.MY THOUGHTS: I have had a love/hate relationship with the Walsh family series. I loved Watermelon; my sides ached from laughing when I first read it, and then read it again regularly over the years. I detested Rachel's Holiday. Just. Did. Not. Like. It. One. Little. Bit. I had high hopes for Angels, #3 in the series. Loved the beginning, but our relationship went downhill from there, and even though the ending was almost decent, by then I was over it. The problem was everything between the beginning and the end. Very little happened. I didn't enjoy the endless days Maggie spent hanging out doing n0thing (the zero instead of o is quite intentional). There are a lot of mixed messages in the plot. It's like Keyes is trying to please everyone, and not offend anyone, and it's just plain annoying! I can't even remember raising a chuckle during this read. I am a Marian Keyes fan, but really, she missed the boat with this one. But I do love the cover!**THE AUTHOR: Marian Keyes (born 10 September 1963) is an Irish novelist and non-fiction writer, best known for her work in women's literature.

82747,Angels,Faith,195,18,5,"January 17, 2009","I consider Angels the best book Marian Keyes has ever written (although I havent yet read all her books). Maggie is clearly the most sympathetic of the Walsh-sisters. I also think that Angels deals with wider themes. Maggie's problem isnt really low self-esteem, like Claire's and Rachel's. She’s somehow a deeper character. I also liked the plot. In Angels Marian Keyes is more entertaining than ever. I really laughed, especially when Maggie’s family came to LA to visit her. The Walsh family seems to be an Irish version of Bridget Jones' family. Marian however makes her chanters more realistic and nicer than Helen fielding. Angels was also a real page-turner like no other book I have read for a while has been. I completely loved it. It captured me. Marian Keyes has a great way of relieving the background of events little by little. First it seemed like in the book Maggie's and Garv's marriage broke down because they were simply tired of each other or something as shallow, but during the book it turned out there was a lot more to it. Really great! I really felt like I was Maggie when I was reading the book.",10,3
82747,Angels,Janjohn,386,18,5,"April 26, 2012","Marian Keyes' style of writing needs getting used to. She writes in a very un-Sophie Kinsella way (which is what I'm used to). This is my first time to read a book by her and I'm impressed. She writes nonsense things with depths. I don't know if that makes any sense but I think, for this book, it does.Okay.Angels is the story of Margaret ""Maggie"" Walsh and her flight to Los Angeles after she found out about her husband Garv's affair with truffle woman. Maggie is probably one of my favorite fictional characters. She' funny and stupid, smart and dumb at the same time, and, well.. she's Maggie! I love how Marian Keyes made her not the usual I'm-too-perfect character writers are not tired of conceiving. She's not perfect, and her imperfection is what made her a beautiful and an easy to love heroine. She had sex with troy and a lesbian named Lara (The sex with Troy was great, by the way. I was just too short), she's ""bad at being bad"", she's had miscarriages, she's not perfect, get it?I was halfway through the book and I was like, ""What's this book all about?""And the answer to that question is what made this book a great read. I won't tell more. telling more will spoil the book for you.Angels is a moving book by Marian Keyes and when you're done reading you'll wish you have someone who'll take snails off your windshield. (Read this book to know what that means.) :P",6,N/A
82747,Angels,Carrie,68,3,1,"July 14, 2008","okay, i started reading this book and i thought it was AWFUL! i got to chapter 5 and it was getting more awful! I don't seem to ever do this, but I quit reading the book and returned it to the library. it just wasn't worth my time. i don't know if it was because i hadn't read any of the others in the series and didn't know the characters, but i didn't want to know them, they werent worth it! i wouldn't even give it a full star, maybe a quarter of a star.SKIP it!",6,N/A
82747,Angels,Trin,"1,718",543,2,"July 16, 2008","This book almost does something very interesting for chick lit: the main character, an Irish woman whose marriage is coming apart, comes to L.A. to escape from it all. She is shocked—shocked!—to discover that the old friend she's staying with has another friend who's a lesbian. Then she gets a little crush on the lesbian friend. Then she has a lesbian fling! This is almost cool like fanfic. But then the main character realizes that she really loves her husband and goes back to him. Sigh.Keyes does the same thing with the flashback abortion plot. Main character (whose name, in case you can't tell, I've totally forgotten) goes to England to get an abortion. But at the last second she changes her mind! THEN SHE MISCARRIES ANYWAY! Now, in the present, she has angst because she thinks this has made her unable to have a baby now that she wants one. Um...wouldn't this plot have been better if it involved actual guilt from an actual abortion? There's too much trying to play to both sides in this book. It's annoying.But the brief lesbian fling part was hot.",5,8
82747,Angels,-amelia-,92,21,1,"March 15, 2017","I hated it. I hated the way she wrote as it wasn't challenging in anyway. I hated the storyline as it was predictable and made me fall asleep. I hated her characters they were so boring bland and the same as any other basic characters. The main reason I hated it was for the meaning behind it(that i got at least) It implied that for women to succeed and be successful in life they MUST get married. Oh wait no now women should have children or else they've failed at life and at being a women. Forget education women should just stay at home because the men should do the work. See what I mean? As a feminist (can I add that feminists are for equality and not for superiority as some people seem to believe.) I did not enjoy this book. And it talked about the LGBT community as if they were a different species. Which is not ok. Another thing is the way it referred to mental health (like depression for example) was very insensitive and was romantizing it. Depression is not 'an emotion' to throw around like confetti.The story is about a woman that is sensible in everyway possible. Until she leaves her husband after his affair and runs away to Hollywood. After that it's a series of martinis and heartbreak. The story was so slow and boring. When I got to the end I honestly saw no point whatsoever in the storyline. Her characters weren't complex just plain boring. Maybe this was for a realistic affect but I mean still. The main character was called Maggie. I thought she was very very stupid and extremely annoying.Her writing bored be so much I couldn't even get through the whole book and ended up reading the epilogue. Everything was predictable. And the ending was literally the worst ever. Her writing was so awful it made me understand why people hate reading.What I learnt:""women are emotionally unstable"" and ""what's that? You don't want to have children? Woman you are very wrong! You must have children in order to succeed as a woman!""Recommendations: anyone that wants to bash this book and how truly terrible it was.",4,N/A
82747,Angels,Katsuro,388,7,3,"February 15, 2021","So! Another Marian Keyes; another occasion for me to say that I liked it, buuuuut...First of all, there's the protagonist, Maggie Walsh. She's the third of Marian Keyes's most famous literary characters, the Walsh sisters, to be the protagonist of her own novel. The first-person narration is pretty much identical, style-wise, to the narration from the earlier two books about the Walsh sisters Claire and Rachel, even though these are supposed to be three different characters. At this point, it's starting to feel like Marian Keyes only has one voice that she can write in – a zany, oh-I'm-such-a-silly-and-confused-woman voice – and gives that voice to every one of her characters.The second thing to discuss is the plot. The earlier two Walsh sister novels didn't really have stand-out plots, but to be fair, they didn't need stand-out plots. One of them was a standard love story, and the other one was a standard drug addiction story. What made the books interesting were the characters and the jokes (because while I might be critical of her, Keyes is an excellent humorist).So what about this book's plot?Well, there isn't one, really. At least not one worth the name. Maggie Walsh goes to Los Angeles to live with her scriptwriter friend Emily, in order to get away from her failed marriage and her unfaithful husband After arriving in LA, she doesn't really want anything or try to achieve anything, so the book's basically just 400 pages of Maggie meeting wacky LA person after wacky LA person. You could cut away almost every scene between page 80 and page 400 and you'd still be able to understand the final 80 pages. (Well, you'd need to leave the flashback chapters in, the ones that describe Maggie's life before the beginning of chapter 1.)That's one of the main recommendations for new writers: Plots are generally driven by a protagonist who wants something and is trying to get that thing. But the only one who that's true of in Angels is Emily, and her subplot isn't taken all that seriously or handled all that well. She could have been the Ahab to Maggie's Ishmael (that is to say, the character the book is actually about), but instead she's just a side character.Yes, there are a few sort-of-plotty subplots, but they're very short and inconsequential. Here they are, with the conclusion spoiler-tagged even though they barely get one:1. Maggie gets the hots for Troy, who Emily is in love with.They have sex once and he doesn't call her back. Then in the end it's hastily revealed that Troy's in love with Emily.This plot contributes nothing to the book as a whole.2. Maggie gets to know a lesbian woman named Laura, who's Maggie's first lesbian acquaintance.They end up making love, and right afterwards both of them realize that they're not suited for each other, Maggie realizing she's straight after all just like she thought before meeting Laura, and Laura deciding that Maggie was just a rebound thing and not really Laura's type.This plot contributes nothing to the book as a whole. Also, I didn't really like the gay jokes. Like when Maggie sees Laura's bed while visiting her, and starts thinking of lesbian porn movie titles. Yeah, this book came out nearly two decades ago, but equating ""lesbian"" with ""porn woman"" isn't really something that I dig.3. Emily wants to sell a script in order to get her career going. She keeps hoping her agent will call her back with good news.Her script is accepted, but the execs demand so many changes that in effect, it's a completely different story from how she imagined it. In the end, though, the movie doesn't get made and she gets paid less but doesn't have to see her script get turned into family-friendly pablum.This subplot does contribute something to Emily's characterization, but gets resolved in the ""where-are-they-now"" epilogue, where we get a brief recap of the resolution. It's as if Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope was released with the final Death Star battle replaced by a brief text scroll summing up the entire battle scene in three sentences or fewer.And that makes sense in a way, I'll admit, because we're not supposed to care about Emily. She's not there to be cared about by the reader, she's only a vehicle for more scenes about how crazy Hollywood and the movie business is. The ending isn't all that satisfying either. In the last 30 pages or so, Maggie and her husband simply decide that they want to give it another go and try to fix their marriage. It pretty much comes out of nowhere, and is really just there because the book has to have a happy ending regardless of whether it fits the plot up until that point.That's why I don't like this rule some people have, where books must have happy endings. A completely happy ending simply isn't going to fit every story's plot.Before I finish, let me say a word about the characters. This is a book that has too many characters, and they're as poorly fleshed-out as you'd expect from L.A. characters. (Because people in L.A. are very thin, geddit? Geddit?) Almost everybody has exactly one role to fill and one character trait. Kristy is the mean girl. Troy is the hot guy. None of them are that interesting, and there are too many of them. So yeah. This was a book that had no plot, a repetitive (though entertaining) protagonist who's just like every other Marian Keyes protagonist I've read, and that was okay but nothing special.",3,N/A
82747,Angels,Rebecca,471,6,3,"January 16, 2018","And my love affair with Marian Keyes continues to thrive, in spite of my distaste for chick lit as a genre.This isn't the most thrilling or emotionally moving of her books - when you're writing about the serious, dull, well-behaved member of a family of genial cuckoos, it's hard to make the story stand out. But the book is still engaging, sweet, fun, and an easy read. Ultimately, it was the perfect palate cleanser between heavier, more oppressive literary fare. I probably won't go back to this one as often as I do 'Rachel's Holiday' or 'This Charming Man,' but it was absolutely worth reading.",3,N/A
82747,Angels,Sita,38,74,3,"September 1, 2020",It's a shame Marian Keyes is marketed as an author of fluff because most of her books explore women's lives and traumas with warmth and humour. The only reason this gets 3 instead of 5 stars is my brain automatically rejects any book set in Hollywood where the majority of characters are not sociopaths trying to out-sociopath each other.,3,1 comment
82747,Angels,Thomas Stroemquist,"1,453",120,4,"September 21, 2015","The third book in the series about the Welsh family tells the story of when Maggie, 'the sensible and responsible one' arrives at a turning point in her life.

82747,Angels,Laura Fudge,140,5,2,"February 21, 2012","I have been given a big pile of books from my step mum, many of which are Marian Keyes. A few years ago I read a few Marian Keyes books and I couldn’t remember which ones I had read from the blurb on the back… Probably not a good sign. I am also not a huge fan of “chick lit”.About three chapters into this book I realised I had read it before. I couldn’t remember what had happened, but I was able to guess/remember most of the plot before it happened. The story follows Maggie, who has a big loud Irish family and a husband. Who to be honest, we never really found out much about. From what we do learn, he seems like a really decent bloke.They are on the verge of breaking up as they have barely spoken to each other for months and seem to have some underlying problems that we don’t know about until later on in the book. Maggie realises he’s been seeing someone else and leaves him, which pleases her family, who don’t like him (I still don’t really know why…). She then travels out to LA to see a friend of hers and stay there for a month to get her head together. Her friend Emily is out there writing scripts which keep getting rejected…We then follow them, Emily trying to get a script accepted, and Maggie trying to get her head together by sleeping around with a male friend of Emily’s – a self confessed tart that she falls for then gets annoyed when he doesn’t ring, and Emily’s gay friend Lara. Eventually she sorts out her issues, we find out what caused the split between her and her husband, and she ends up going home back to her husband.Despite the lesbian sub plot which was mildly interesting, this book was a bit slow. It seemed to take ages to get going, and I didn’t really like many of the characters, they were either stereotypical or predictable, (and not because I had read this years before…)This type of book is not usually my thing, too much shopping and not enough real people talking to each other about their problems. A nice bit of entertainment, easy to read, but not really my cup of tea.",2,N/A
82747,Angels,EMA,283,15,2,"August 2, 2021","This book was disappointing. It could have been one of the better Walsh books. I didn't mind the slower pace some readers disliked because Maggie's conflicts were more psychologically complex, struggling with two miscarriages and lingering guilt/confusion after a teenage abortion and abandonment by that boyfriend. I liked that her conflict was with her husband and how that played out in their marriage in a more nuanced way than just he's a pig/I'm long suffering kind of scenarios. It was really just one thing that stuck in my craw and almost ruined the book which is the totally weird homophobia and othering, I guess, of the books lesbian character, Lara. I know this is from 2003 and I was trying to allow for times having changed with that and a few other things that in 2021 look a little cringey but the Lara stuff was so messy. Maggie goes from being so weird and uncomfortable and making terrible jokes about Lara at every encounter with her that she just seems like a bigot and then she comes out that she thinks she may be bi and she's attracted to women and then I was like OK! That's why she was so weird, I get it. Then she hooks up with Lara and keeps claiming they had sex (they didn't) and is grossed out by her afterwards and behaves like a dick, telling people she only wanted to hook up with Lara because she wanted to turn guys on. And then, at the very end, when talking with her husband, tells him she explored her sexuality with women and he's happy for her because she's told him before she's attracted to women? It was just badly and inconsistently handled throughout and the only result I got from it was that Maggie is a shitty person who uses people and judges them? It was hard not to dislike her after that. If the badly mangled Lara subplot had not made it into this book, I would have really liked it.",2,N/A
82747,Angels,MaryG2E,372,1 follower,4,"August 26, 2017","3.5★sAngels is a light, humorous chick lit novel, which entertained me a lot. Following the break-up of her nine year marriage to Garv, Dublin resident Maggie Walsh jets off to Los Angeles to spend some time with her friend Emily O'Keeffe. Emily, a talented script writer, has been struggling for a couple of years, trying to break into the LA movie industry. In short time Maggie is drawn into the crazy lifestyles of Los Angeles wannabes, which become great sources of amusing anecdotes. Underneath the breezy writing style though are some thoughtful analyses of the cut-throat movie industry and the bizarre, and sometimes desperate lengths to which hopeful actors and production people will go to fit in, be noticed and get ahead. I laughed out loud at this exchange:On Sunday evening, Lara came over.""Not out with Nadia?"" Emily asked.""Nah, she got her butthole bleached and can't sit down.""""Excuse me?"" I spluttered. ""Her butthole? Bleached?""""It's the latest thing in plastic surgery,"" Lara explained. ""Lots of girls do it. To make it look pretty.""""Like getting your teeth whitened,"" Emily chipped in. ""Except it's your butthole instead.""Maggie has a rather sad back-story, which emerges in the latter part of the novel, and which adds poignancy to her situation with the failure of her marriage.It's not a Pulitzer Prize winner, but an enjoyable story, and would be a great holiday read.",2,N/A
