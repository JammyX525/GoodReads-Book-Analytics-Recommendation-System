19448,AllAmerican Girl,Rebecca,70,2,3,"August 11, 2009","This is a good book if you're just looking for a quick read on vacation or a weekend. Not too intellectually stimulating but, like many of Meg Cabot's books, a good day dream.",61,6
19448,AllAmerican Girl,ellemaddy,519,41,5,"August 16, 2022","I love this book. I read it when I was in the fifth grade and when I reread it now it brings back so many old memories, good and bad. I remember back in fifth grade I had like the biggest crush on these 2 guys who shall remain nameless and I just wouldn't shut up about it. Honestly I'm a bit shocked I got through the fifth grade without getting strangled by my friends at least once. I talked about these 2 guys so much that I started code naming them Jack and David from the character in All-American Girl. I mean, it was crazy because I'd be like ""Did you know that Jack looked back at me on math???"" and my friend would be like ""OK. which one is jack again?"" Thinking back about it, I just want to scream. I led such an embarrassing life when I was little. But it wasn't all crazy and horrible, this book actually made me a whole lot braver. I actually got the guts to give one of my crush chocolate on valentines day (so I kinda gave everyone chocolates to cover my tracks but his was the biggest. I tried my best to be subtle about it, okay. I really did. Don't laugh at me) because I was like ""OK if Sam can finally be brave enough to face David at the art class and she ended up with him then so can i"" so I literally threw a huge pack of Toblerone at 'Jack' and I was like 'Here' and he looked positively scared because we've never even talked before and 'Jack' was like 'Whoa. This is for me?' and I said 'Yeah' then he said 'Thanks!' and at the end of the day I heard he started dating a senior and I cried then I swore off boys forever. The end.I could relate to Sam because she is a middle child and so am i. Her sister is super popular and so was my sister! We're both treated like we're invisible and there's nothing special about us except the fact that we both just really really love art. I literally acted like Sam (the weird artistic girl who cares about stuff no one bothered to care about) and I even started comparing everyone I knew in real life to the characters from this book. That's how much I loved it. I even quoted words from it and spoke like the way the characters in this book did. I read this book at least twice every month and everytime my Mom caught me reading it she would roll her eyes and made a rude comment about me not having a life. Everytime we travelled I'd bring this book, Confession of a Teenage Drama Queen and Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass with me. Trust me, those 3 books are the most battered looking book I own and I'm not the kind of person who would treat my books with disrespect. I just loved those 3 books so much that they're almost always with me like a rag doll or something, I even dared to write my name at the first page of those books with glittered pen, curlicues and all. Now I can't say that this book is the best book I've ever read or to say that this book is even better than so and so but it has sentimental value and it was one of the very first books I've read so it left such a great impression on me and that matters to me so 5/5 through and through, forever and always for this one no matter how much embarrassing shit it has put me through.reread august 15th 2022. still so good!!!

19448,AllAmerican Girl,Laura,"1,613",81,4,"August 11, 2008","Samantha is caught selling celebrity portraits at school and so her mother decides that maybe she needs a creative outlet and signs her up for art classes. Samantha does not want to take art classes, she doesn't think that they would be any use to her, and when she runs it by her older sister's boyfriend, Jack (whom she's secretly in love with) he totally agrees with her. Samantha decides to just go to the first class and then she'll ditch it, but she finds that it is actually kind of interesting, and that there is also a boy her age. Then one day (after she has skipped class, and hung out in the CD store upstairs for an hour) she comes out and sees the president walking into a store, but what she also sees is a man with a gun aiming for his head. Before Samantha can really think about it, she tackles the guy with the gun and saves the president's life. Samantha, as she sees it, thinks her life is over.Top Ten Things You Should Know Before You Read This Book:1. It made me laugh.2. I was highly amused by the top ten lists littered throughout the book telling the story of what Samantha had gotten herself into.3. Some parts of the story were slightly unrealistic and made me want to gag.4. I didn't care for the age different between Samantha and David.5. I thought that sometimes Samantha got a little ahead of herself and needed to respect authority more.6. I thought Samantha's sister was a pretty interesting character.7. I didn't care for Samantha's sister's boyfriend, I thought that he needed to grow up and get over himself, I also couldn't see what her sister was doing hanging around this kind of scum.8. I thought that the fact that Samantha was ""in love"" a little unrealistic for someone that young.9. Overall I enjoyed this book.10. I'd probably recommend it.*Taken from my book reviews blog: http://reviewsatmse.blogspot.com/2008...",16,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Ardent Reader,221,211,4,"August 24, 2019","Short, fast-paced, easy read and hilarious like all of Meg Cabot's books.The story was a bit similar (the writing style) to the princess diaries series.Highly recommended this for teens. ",12,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Steph Su,943,452,5,"April 12, 2009","Sophomore Samantha Madison is redheaded, a middle child, left-handed, and, in her opinion, one of the only teenage girls left who have not succumbed to the soul-sucking fashion trends of modern-day society. She's a wannabe radical: she dyed her wardrobe black, and she's in love with her popular older sister Lucy's boyfriend Jack, who's as ""radical"" as they get. Sam thinks it's the end of her already lousy world when, as a punishment for bad grades, her parents send her to art lessons at Susan Boone's. Sam's a good artist, but she doesn't take well to criticism, and so when on the first day Susan Boone accuses her of not drawing what she knows, Sam decides not to come back. Ever. Which turns out to be a good thing, because while she’s hiding from Susan Boone at the following lesson, she manages to stop an assassination attempt on the president. All of a sudden Sam is the “it” girl at her school, the US, and the whole world. The president awards her the position of teen ambassador to the UN, and his cute son David (who is also in Susan Boone's art class) thinks there's something special about Sam. Only Sam knows there's nothing very heroic about what she did. And she doesn't understand why David's being so nice to her, or why her heart skitters when he smiles at her, or why she feels so bad after David finds out she had used him to make Jack jealous at a party. Because she's totally in love with Jack. Right?What fun ALL-AMERICAN GIRL is! People of all ages will enjoy this book. Samantha is an amazing protagonist, and her narration will pull you along like nothing ever had. Highly recommended!",11,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Muse-ic ♬,379,110,3,"January 30, 2016","3.5 Mediocre.Fun. Frustrating.Also, I've noticed that most of Meg Cabot's teenage female protagonists are very nearly the same. Sure they look different, but they all asks the same questions, they all have the same tone, most of them are outcasts, and the boys they fall in love with are the boys that correspond to each other in the books.Another thing they all have in common? They're all insufferably ANNOYING! Like Please Kill me, I can't take any more of this annoying.Samantha Madison sees a guy pulling out a gun and preparing to shoot the president while she skips her art class. So she jumps him, saves the president, breaks her wrist, and meets the president's son.That pretty much sums up the entire book. Aside from the attempted assassination, it's pretty fluffy and annoying.Throughout the entire book, Sam sits there just moping because she thinks her older sister Lucy's boyfriend, Jack, is her soulmate. All us readers are like Helloooooo idiot. Knock knock! Anyone home upstairs? David is right there. Yoohooo, David! Give her another chance. She's just being dumb!Anyways, there isn't much to talk about.I don't like Jack.Rebecca is weird.I like Lucy.Her parents are okay.David is great.Short and to the point.The end.",9,4
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Nev,995,125,4,"May 26, 2019","I first read this book about 15 years ago when I was 13. I remember loving it because it was just such a fun and ridiculous story. So I was curious to pick it back up again as a 28 year old to see if it’s something I could still enjoy. All-American Girl follows the story of Sam Madison after she saves the President of the United States from an assassination attempt. In the aftermath she becomes famous overnight, is named as the Teen Ambassador to the United Nations, and… could there be sparks flying between her and the President’s son David? It’s obviously a very ridiculous, not believable plot but I think it’s a totally fun read. I’d be way more critical of the book if it were published today, but looking back on it as a relic from 2002, I think it’s just a sweet, funny book. The book is definitely dated, there’s so much early 2000s era girl hate in the book. Sam is artsy and alternative and is always putting down her sister Lucy for being a cheerleader and more “typically girly.” However Sam does evolve over the course of the book and her relationship with Lucy becomes really special, especially in book 2. There’s also an instance of the R word being used as an insult, which unfortunately was really common at that time. One thing that I didn’t remember, but was actually nice to see, is that there is a little bit of actual politics in the book. Sam argues with the President on immigration when he only wants to present a nice sanitized view of the US while Sam wants to present the harsh realities of our country. I think if a book like this came out today it would definitely be way more political than this one was. The one really annoying thing about the book is that Sam is obsessed with her sister’s boyfriend and thinks that he should be with her instead of Lucy. While there’s no cheating and she never actively does anything to try and break them up, it’s still annoying to read about. I honestly don’t know if I recommend this or not. I’m most definitely being somewhat blinded by nostalgia since I have such fond memories of this book. It’s definitely not the most well-written or excellently plotted piece of YA fiction, but I still think it’s super fun. I will say, that if you decide to give it a go you really need to think about the fact that it came out in 2002 and don’t judge it by the current standards of YA. ",8,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,GrapedUp,233,25,4,"May 28, 2017","Audiobook rating:4,5 starsContent rating: 4 starsShort, fast-paced and exactly what I imagined Samantha would sounds like! I really, really enjoy this audiobook. A sweet reminiscent of what my taste as a tween is like! I definitely couldn't appreciate this book as much as I appreciated it as a silly little girl, but I think it's still a reasonably good book to read for a silly, angsty tween :P",8,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Mela,"1,385",168,4,"November 7, 2022","I so regret that I don't know a teenage girl (let's say, between 12-16 years old), who can read books in English. I would give her to read 'All-American Girl' immediately, no matter if she would want to or not ;-)I split YA/teenage (for them, not only about them) novels for two main groups: serious books (often sad, angry etc.) and light, funny books (but not dumb). This one belongs to the latter.It was deliciously funny (I have laughed out loud) and also really wise. It was a rather short book, but there was a place for family relationships, the way of becoming/being an artist, even glimpses of such issues like immigrants, hunger in poor countries. But most of all it was a really smart insight into teenage girls (at least some of them).
  You may not like what Maria sees, but keeping everyone else from seeing it isn't going to make it any less real, or make the problem go away.
Meg Cabot did in here a really good job. Although most of the adult readers (probably) will not be able to read it because it was rather for young readers.",7,3
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Karin,"1,310",5,3,"January 6, 2020","Samantha Madison, 15, saves the president of the United States from an assassination attempt, and the next thing you know we are in a Meg Cabot of The Princess Diaries type of young adult romance novel. She is sure she's in love with her sister's boyfriend, but everyone else is sure it's with David, the boy she met in her new art class that turns out to be no less than the president's son. It was fun, completely unbelievable and full of lists. However, when she got in trouble for selling pictures she drew of high school girls with celebrities and one was Jame van der Beek, I realized how quickly this book has become dated, now that he's an over 40 married father of five. My kids were too young to have crushes when this book was written, and now he's too old to be on most teen's radars.",7,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Bitchin' Reads,459,121,3,"March 9, 2018","I haven't read this in years. It isn't exactly as I remember, but still entertaining. I am really glad I got through the phase of being like Sam fast when I was growing up--the lack of maturity, the know-it-all demeanor...it is grating now, whereas I had been all ""YAS GRL"" as a middle-schooler/high-schooler. Signs that 10+ years of maturing experiences change one's perspective.",6,1 comment

Top 10 Reasons I Found This Book Amazing1. Samantha is genuinely funny. She has a great sarcastic quality. Everything she says/thinks has a bit of an edge to it.2. Samantha is a bit of a badass. Yes, she jumps on the back of a man with a gun, but even more brave than that was when she confesses how she feels about David.3. Samantha's confused and messed up and anxious about boys (specifically Jack and David). She's exactly like I was with boys when I was in high school.4. Samantha has a wonderful family. They are supportive (even her sisters, which is amazing and rare). Her mom and dad are a perfect balance of strict but loving.5. David is book boyfriend goals. He is sweet and determined. He is forgiving and funny. He is smart and witty. Even after he finds out some not perfect aspects of Samantha he still likes her. 6. Samantha isn't your typical heroine where she is perfect and knows what she wants. She's imperfectly perfect. She has failures along the way but she learns from them.7. Susan Boone. That is the art teacher I wanted. She's not only a great educator but when her student of three weeks shows up with bread at her house randomly, she's super cool with it. 8. Samantha is a great bestie. She's supportive of Catherine wanting to date a guy from the local arcade, even going as far as going to a popular girl (she hates her) party so that Catherine could feel cool.9. Samantha is completely confident in who she is as a person which is super crazy for a high schooler. She doesn't care that she's not popular. In fact, she doesn't want to be popular. She just wants to be who she is, which is someone that likes Gwen Stafani and painting and wearing black clothes.10. When she realizes she's wrong about something (#Jack) she not only apologizes bit she goes above and beyond to make up for her wrongdoings. There really are probably more, but I'm guessing you may not have made it through the whole lost anyway lol. But, seriously, it's an amazing book and you should definitely give it a try if you haven't before",5,N/A
19448,AllAmerican Girl,Nasty Lady MJ,"1,057",16,4,"March 30, 2015","I think this book is very interesting to look to from a political perspective. Well, like political time capsule perspective. The early 2000’s were a very different world, politically, for America and it shows in here. Ultra patriotism, right wing administration, pop culture references.That is purely a Meg Cabot thing. Not a political thing. But still,interesting to see how things have changed in ten years. But I’m not going to bore you with that.I really did like this book, even after all this time though. Sam probably isn’t my favorite character, but I think for who she is, Meg did an excellent job depicting her.I think what I love best about All American Girl is that it gives a stupid character consequences for their bone headed idiocy. And Sam tries to make up for being a turd.And boy is she a turd throughout a good chunk of this book.One thing you’ll have to know going in is that this book is ridiculously dated. There are band references that only someone who liked the same music Sam did during that time period are going to get.I’m not a huge Gwen Stefani fan, so it sort of went over my head then and now.The romance, of course, was wonderful. When is it not in a Meg Cabot novel? And I really liked the portrayal of Lucy, a popular girl that is not a jerk but a good person. And I liked how Cabot basically threw it in Sam’s face that she was wrong about her sister.You hardly ever see that in YA.If you’re looking for a sweet little book that’s a nice reminder of the past, give All American Girl a try.",5,1 comment
