2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Stella,482,131,1,"December 29, 2011","Awful.. such a painfully disappointing and dull read! It was pure torture reading it through, which is even worse, since I was so interested by the plot that I went to great efforts to order it online, buy it have it delivered, and all for such an irritating and boring, undeveloped, low quality novel which just dragged on and on! I'm not prejudiced against chick lit, I like it, there are some authors I love : Sophie Kinsella, Melissa Nathan, Marian Keyes, etc, but this one definitely put me off Jill Mansell. Her novel read as if it wasn't edited and if the first draft was published.Her characters were one dimensional, not interesting at all, though I desperately tried to find one character I could like or identify with, but what she gave us was too small for that. The main character, Lola was behaving as a 17 year-old and not the 27 year-old she was, and each time she had those ridiculous eye-rolling daydreams with Dougie, I could have slapped her or hit my head on the wall. And that's not because I'm an old cynic, I'm 24, very romantic and playful, but she just wasn't behaving as an adult 27 year old would! The plot sounded unique and interesting, it's a shame that nothing came out of it.Definitely no more Jill Mansell for me.",26,8
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Bird,780,27,1,"January 18, 2011","Bleh. Really, I should have known better than to read this. I loathe books where the entire plot revolves around some secret the main character can't divulge, thus creating all sorts of complications. But I read it, partly because I had enjoyed a previous Jill Mansell book, and thought that this would be as fun and quirky, too. Nope. Instead, I slogged through 400 pages of a bad plot and obnoxious characters.Lola was an immature, shallow, self-centered brat, plain and simple. She talks about how nice she is, but I really didn't see much of that. She follows Doug around, whining like a little kid about him not forgiving her. She picks on her mother's wardrobe mercilessly. (Who the hell cares what she dresses like?) She disparages her mother's choice in boyfriends - although Malcolm clearly makes her mother happy - simply because she doesn't like the way he looks. Time and again she ignores other people's wishes because they don't coincide with her own. And she briefly goes out with a wealthy man who she doesn't have feelings for, but she chides herself for her lack of lust because *gasp* he's rich, so she should feel something!The worst thing is, most of the other characters are equally unlikable. Sally, who throws temper-tantrums when she doesn't get what she wants, and has ridiculous fantasies about men sweeping her off her feet. (As in, she just met someone, and she's imagining having his children.) Doug's mother, the ultimate cold-hearted bitch. Nick, who propositions Blythe by saying, ""Let's have sex for old time's sake, no one has to know, including your current boyfriend."" Ugh!! I can't remember the last time I read a book with such an unlikable cast of characters!***SPOILERS***Her one selfless act was giving the $12,000 to Alex. But then she proceeds to keep his promise, even after he's died. So she made a promise. Fine. But Alex, who supposedly loved her more than anything, would selfishly want her to keep his secret rather than sharing it with Doug a decade later? I doubt it. What father would want his daughter to miss out on being with the man she loves because she still feels like she has to keep his secret? Not telling Blythe is one thing. But Doug? That was just an annoying way to extend the plot.The ending of the book was abrupt and ridiculous. After 400 pages of Doug not being interested in Lola, he suddenly does a 180 after a brief conversation with her father? How could he be so dim-witted not to wonder what his 17-year-old girlfriend needed 12k for when he first found out, rather than someone having to spell it out for him?",11,N/A
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,boogenhagen,"1,981",651,3,"May 5, 2014","Well it wasn't bad, just not as good as JM's others. The big complaint, Lola should not have wound up with Doug at the end. I wish she would have met somebody better. Yep, she did break up with him at 17 for money, let's face it - two teenagers, one wealthy and the other not and the wealthy one with a mum who is quite willing to do anything to get the girl out of her son's life - the odds are good the relationship isn't going to work out and the girl really needs the money to save her family so she makes the best of a bad situation - cause it isn't too likely that wealthy, mummy-ruled sad sack is going to stick it out anyhow. 10 years on they meet again and it is that old black magic all over again until wealthy boy finds out what poor girl did and then gets irked and dumps her. He really doesn't listen to any explanations or try to see the poor side of it or even really consider talking to his overbearing, interfering mum but he supposedly lurved this girl more than any other. I can see getting pissed initially but to go on for months berating and abusing the girl all the while? Of course it doesn't help that said poor girl keeps throwing herself at him, trying to change his mind. Eventually she gives up and tries to move on and said wealthy boy pops back in to take up where he left off. No explanations, no discussion just moving on to sex. Doug was a prat and Lola, for all her faults deserved better than the wuss he turned out to be with his little hurt feelings and no compassion. Hopefully the infatuation wears off after a few rounds in bed and Lola can find a real, decent guy who actually gives her the benefit of the doubt and knows her moral character a bit better. ",9,N/A

2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Fatima,41,29,5,"July 26, 2016","This novel follows Lola, a 17 year old who is offered £10,000 to dump her boyfriend – by her boyfriend’s mother. She believes Lola isn’t good enough for her son Dougie and that she dresses like a cheap tart. Lola shoots her down, but then discovers she needs the money to help her step-father get out of trouble. Her father took loans from different people and the total sum was 15,000 pounds. She promises her father to tell no one about the money, or why she took it, so she writes dougie a letter where she dumps him and leaves the country. Ten years later, back in the UK, she stops a mugging, only to later find out the lady who was being attacked was Dougie’s mother. Whilst she is round at the celebration meal, Dougie overhears her on the phone telling Gabe, her cute next door neighbour about the money. When he hears this all he can feel is anger and hate. However, in her distress, Lola strikes up a friendship with Sally, Dougie’s older sister, who ends up living across the hall from her. Lola can’t believe how she feels for Dougie though when she sees him again and finds ways to keep seeing him – of course this is helped by her friendship with Sally. Yet Dougie is not interested at all.Lolas optimism got kind of annoying but i liked her regardless but i also felt sorry for her at times. I loved that she refused to tell anyone that was the reason why she took the money too. However, her persistant longing for Dougie was a bit annoying after a while – she seemed to pine for him all the time! I actually found Doug arrogant and a bit of an asshole! He was the injured party but he seemed to think he was better than Lola because he came from more money (like his mother in face – who I really didn’t like!) I did like Sally though! She seemed like she would be a fun person to hang out with! I liked Gabe too and felt sorry for him that the new job direction (being a papparazzi) he was going down wasn’t going well!This is an entertaining book, a chick-lit novel about first love, friendship and what we will do for those we love. If I’m completely honest, this isn’t my favourite Jill Mansell novel. It was a simple story with a predictable outcome – the only shock being that Lola’s biological father turned up out of the blue. I didn’t find myself desperate to know what was going to happen, but that said, I did read it to the end and I did enjoy it. This didn’t challenge me or move me in anyway, but I did enjoy it and it did entertain me.This was a fairly quick read, even if it was over 400 pages long! The outcomes – the different romances – didn’t surprise me at all. A light read, entertaining and fun. This isn’t the best Mansell I’ve read but it hasn’t put me off her books. I’m glad I’ve finally read this book and I did enjoy it. and yes i would recommend this to all.",4,1 comment
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Samantha,563,54,4,"April 23, 2009","From the back of the book:""Young Lola, under duress, accepts a huge bribe to break up with her boyfriend. The worst part is, the bribe is from his mother. Ten years later, when they meet again, her feelings for him are as strong as ever-but how is she going to win him back without telling him why she broke his heart in the first place?""My thoughts:My thoughts on this book can be summed up in one sentence: ""What a fun read!"" Seriously, it really was a fun read and I ended up enjoying this book immensely. I can't say that I read a lot of chick lit. but this is an author that I will be looking for more of. The main character was hilarious...Lola is far from perfect and not worried about it. She is lovable, crass, crazy, and not quite realistic at times. But I couldn't help but like her and hope for the best for her. And I am going to have to repeat how hilarious she was. There were times that I was reading this book where I was shaking with laughter (this happened while I was reading on my break at work..they probably all think I'm nuts now :) My only qualm with the book was that the plot wasn't realistic at times....the tidy bow type of ending for example. But it really didn't detract from the book for me because I liked it so much. It was pure escapist reading and I was caught up in its' thrall. One of the quotes on the back of the book said it best when they said ""you won't get a thing done till it's finished."" I didn't want to put it down and was constantly wondering what Lola was going to do next. All in all, a fun read and I have found a new author that I will reading more of in the future!",4,1 comment
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Obsidian,"2,675",918,4,"December 29, 2016","Please note that I gave this book 3.5 stars and rounded it up to 4 stars on Goodreads.I read two Mansell books back in the day and told myself that maybe those two books should be enough. Both a lot of her works were available via my library and I decided to try again to see if I like any of these books much better. The answer is, I did and I didn’t. What grabs me a lot about this book is that I loved every character in this book except for the main character Lola. Lola is annoying and if she had been a man everyone would have been yelling at her that her nice guy act to her ex demanding another chance was out of bounds. I hate it when female characters do things we would give male characters crap for. Readers know right away (and the synopsis spoils you) that Lola takes money from her boyfriend’s mother when she is forced to. As part of the money exchange she dumps Doug and then in my opinion was doing great in her life until she comes face to face with Dougie again and decides she must have him because everyone knows your teen love is your forever love. And yes sometimes you are, but since I saw no chemistry at all between Lola and Dougie I felt a bit baffled by these two characters.If that’s not enough, the story switches POV many times with Lola’s long time friend and next door neighbor, Dougie’s sister, as well as Lola’s mom and someone from Lola’s mom past. I recall not being in love with the parade of characters in other books, and this one had almost too many, but somehow everything works.We get some secondary characters here and there, like Dougie’s mother who must be evil incarnate based on everything we are shown. I wish that we had a face to face with her and Lola ever, but instead that whole thing was just Lola asking to be forgiven and wanting to move on from the whole thing.The writing to me was typical British chick lit which I loved. There were a few laugh out loud moments I had too. Mainly when we have Lola who is a bookstore manager dealing with customers thinking she should know everything about books. Her figuring out what books people are looking for would have been a nice recurring gag. I maybe snickered when another customer is bereft that his wife’s favorite author, Jane Austen has died. And yup, he thinks she died recently.The flow was off though in this one. I think it’s because Lola’s best friend across the way and then his situation with a live in roommate felt like they were in two different books. They really took up a good portion of the book (not complaining) because maybe even Mansell got tired of Lola and her antics.The ending for everyone else worked perfectly, but I thought Lola’s happy ending came out of nowhere. I wish that Mansell had went another way there with another love for Lola to think about or get involved with, since her being stuck on Dougie through the whole book after she lays eyes on him made me start calling her Ted (in honor of Ted Mobsy from How I Met Your Mother).",3,N/A
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Debra,"1,109",76,4,"August 7, 2016","This is the first and only book I have read written by Jill Mansell and I found the book to be easy to read and was instantly hooked. I instantly loved the main character, Lola, who was in the worst possible situation at the beginning of the story - keep your boyfriend or have £10,000... Lolca decides to take the money and run, something which I had a bit of a shout about when I was reading that part of the book.... I definately formed a lot of opinions throughout reading this! Would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good debate..!",3,N/A
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,jamie,640,10,1,"April 16, 2017","This book kind of sucked balls. There were too many characters, and they were all dreadfully boring characters at that. Too many twist and turns, all boring. And if this is supposed to be a rekindling romance between Lola and Doug, maybe they should actually spend some time together. Just my opinion. They were barely together in the story, maybe two or three time at the most and even then there was no flirting or stolen glances. Nothing happened in this book and it was all over the place.",3,N/A

Only reason it took me so long to read is because I’ve been so busy with barely any time to read.Loved Lola. She has such a big heart and so loyal to her step-dad. Loved her friendship with Gabe and Sally. Couldn’t help but feel her frustrations with Doug and that inevitability when she realises she’s wasting her time. It all comes good in the end and ultimately, that’s what it’s all about with Jill’s books. Loved it! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",3,N/A

I don't know how she does it, but I always fall in love with her characters, always care what happens to them, and even if I can sometimes predict who will end up with who, I don't care.

2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Anna,473,30,3,"February 1, 2017","Review originally posted on Diary of an EccentricWhen Lola was 17, her boyfriend’s mother made her an offer she couldn’t refuse–a ton of money to stop seeing her son. Dougie was Lola’s first love, and Lola wanted to tell his mother to stick her money where the sun doesn’t shine, but she takes it, even negotiates a higher amount, to keep her family together. Distraught over the end of her relationship with Dougie, she flees the country.Ten years later, Lola is living in Notting Hill as a bookstore manager. After a party, she intervenes in an attack on a woman and is thrust back into Dougie’s life. He finds out about the bribe, but Lola refuses to tell him–or anyone–why she needed the money. He wants nothing to do with her, but Lola is determined to win him back.Lola’s quest to win Dougie’s forgiveness and heart is the backdrop for a humorous story that is chick lit at its finest. Jill Mansell peppers An Offer You Can’t Refuse with a cast of delightful characters: Blythe, Lola’s eccentric, fashion-challenged mother; Sally, Dougie’s older sister and Lola’s new best friend who’s had a rough time in the romance department; Gabe, Lola’s neighbor and good friend who everyone suspects is gay but isn’t; and EJ, the music mogul and dorky dresser who tries to win Lola’s heart.The book is a quick, light read, and I really enjoyed it. But I wasn’t a big fan of Lola. I could see why she acted as she did at 17, but throughout the book, I had to keep reminding myself that Lola was 27 because she didn’t seem to grow up much at all. She couldn’t understand why Dougie was so angry with her, and she was shameless in her pursuit of him to the point where I was embarrassed for her in several scenes. She also was very shallow, wanting to break her mother and her boyfriend up simply because the boyfriend had a bushy beard, hairy toes, and a wardrobe in need of updating–even though her mother kept going on about how happy she was. If the point of the storyline was that Lola had changed over the past 10 years, I guess I just didn’t see it.However, I loved Sally and Gabe. Gabe as a fledgling paparazzi was hilarious, and putting neat freak Gabe and messy Sally in the same flat made for some interesting scenes. Though predictable, An Offer You Can’t Refuse was fun and captivating.",2,N/A
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Jo,26,1 follower,2,"May 27, 2020","I chose this book because I wanted to break up my reading and this was a change of genre from the previous few books I’ve read. I was intrigued by the plot as it gives it an extra layer to a pure romance novel.I thought it was successful how the book starts 10 years ago to set the scene, then jumps to a few years later to catch up on some details before the majority being set in the present day. That said, there was the issue that Lola doesn’t always act as a 27 year old in the main section of the book, some of her actions make it feel like she’s still 17, as she was at the beginning of the novel in the “10 years ago” chapters. The strong friendship bond between Lola and Sally meant that the book wasn’t just about Lola trying to win Dougie’s heart back, which I appreciated as I always enjoy a “best friends” story incorporated into a novel as well. However, in my opinion, Sally didn’t always act as a best friend towards Lola. I really disliked the storyline about Sally fancying Lola’s long lost father. I know some relationships with big age gaps work well but Sally virtually admitted it’d be inappropriate for them to be together, yet she didn’t give up on this fantasy. The only partial saving grace was that Nick was shocked once Sally had made a move on him but this storyline seemed to yield little further character development. Although Nick wasn’t romantically interested in Sally, Jill Mansell regurgitated a similar plot at the end of the book when Lola unexpectedly found him on a date with her colleague, Cheryl, from the bookshop. I’m not sure how Nick finds it acceptable to date all Lola’s friends and I was really put off by both of these storylines. No matter how sweet it was that Lola rekindled the relationship with her father and I’m truly pleased for her that she was able to meet Nick and get on so well with him, I still found it odd that, at the age of 27, he was interfering in her love life and trying to get her and Doug back together. On the other hand, it was cute, despite being totally cringey, that they did get back together in the end, I just thought they went about it the wrong way. This was quite a slow read for me, I couldn’t really get into it and think I only found myself picking it up at any given opportunity just to get closer to finishing it, not because I was particularly enjoying the story. Sorry, Jill Mansell but I won’t be recommending this book to my friends. I should’ve just stuck with the books I know and love but I’ll just put it down to experience!",1 like,N/A
2596345,An Offer You Cant Refuse,Chelsea,54,33,3,"May 4, 2019","I have to admit I struggled a bit with this one. It's an enjoyable read and very easy to follow, but I did find it difficult to fully engage with the characters and plot lines, and I think I can boil this down to a couple of reasons:1) Lola - the central female protagonist - is extremely cocky. I love confidence in female characters but there is a fine line between that and sheer arrogance. She spends most of the book thinking she is the absolute bee's knees and that she can magically turn her ex's head and win him over again because she's just that good. Nope. Sorry, it doesn't sit well with me at all. Be confident, yes, but take your head out of your backside for five minutes, please. And stop chasing someone who is - at least outwardly - showing he isn't interested in you.2) I had no interest in the sub-plots. Unfortunately I do find that with some of Jill Mansell's books, I tend to skip over at least one of the other characters' plot lines. In this book, I completely skimmed over Gabe and Sally's parts. I didn't connect with them at all. 3) The inevitable reconciliation happened way to late in the game. I'm talking about 10 pages from the end. I need more than that! Give me at least a chapter of them being together. (Plus, the way Doug explained his reluctance to allow Lola back into his life? I'm not buying it. Just have him admit that his ego was bruised, let him be honest about it. Honesty holds far more weight in my eyes.)Overall, I'm glad I read this - as I am trying to make my way through Mansell's back catalogue - but it's not up there with my faves. Not bad, not great. Kind of a middle-ground book for me.",1 like,N/A
