588369,A Place Called Here,Aoibhínn,158,210,3,"July 13, 2017","This novel had the potential to be so much more, but I was left frustrated and disappointed with the ending of the book. I think Ahern could have made her ending much more powerful, instead it is left fairly ambiguous with a conclusion hanging in midair. The idea of a place where all missing objects and people go intrigued me, but at times I was left laughing at the naive idea of all these missing people, from all over the world, speaking different languages, living together in peace and harmony, in a self-sustaining community, with freshly baked doughnuts arriving daily courtesy of absent-minded delivery boys, etc. At times, I got really bored with the novel as it felt more like a fairytale story for children, not a book for adults. The relationship between the main character, Sandy, and her psychiatrist, Gregory, seemed completely implausible and unrealistic. There just wasn't enough time devoted into exploring how this romantic relationship could have come about. In fact, Ahern, seemed to hint all along that Sandy would end up with Jack Ruttle, that somehow they 'connected'. I waited for the big reunion at the end but got nothing, Jack went back to the girlfriend he didn't love anymore and Sandy went back to the guy that gave up on her. And what about all the other missing people trapped in 'Here'? Why didn't they get found too? Clearly, a lot of people trapped there, Bobby especially, wanted to get out and return home to their family and friends. Why was Sandy the only one that returned home? I really think Cecelia Ahern would be far better suited to writing for children. She has a great imagination and comes up with good storylines but her style of writing is rather naive and immature.

588369,A Place Called Here,mimi (during exams),290,153,3,"December 29, 2022","Unlike Sandy, I have no problem with missing items: pen, socks, books, thoughts, and memories; I lose them all the time. Sometimes, during the day, I remember that I threw away that sock or that I gave that pen to somebody. The worst is when I'm in bed, trying to fall asleep, and I remember something I totally forgot, good or bad doesn't matter. I’ll spend the next days - weeks if it goes badly -, trying not to think of that memories, only with the result of imprinting it for much longer. All of this stops when I remember something new, and most of the time I lose hours of sleep.But nothing can compare to dealing with a missing person. And God knows how much I hate this terminology.In Italy, we have a tv show that talks about missing people and people no one is looking for because they’re not important enough or there isn’t enough proof for a case. It's an extremely important program because, even if they don't find the person you're looking for, they never stop looking for the truth. But I hate it.It makes me feel like a bad person, but that program gives me the weekly amount of anxiety in two hours and a half on a normal Wednesday evening. And, honestly, how a person can be missing? It's the 21st Century: there are cameras at every corner of the street, everyone has a cell phone, and there are tv programs and sometimes even the national news. For me, it's inconceivable that someone can go for a walk one day and then go missing for fifty or more years.So yes, this book didn't cure my anxiety.At first, I thought the author was trying to use a metaphor: “some people vanish with no reason but, in reality, it’s because they lose themselves first” or something like that. But probably I read too much into this since the beginning. There's no big message under Sandy’s story, only a poor explanation and poor editing for the tragedy of having a loving person missing.I’m a little disappointed, but Cecelia Ahern wrote so many books and not all of them can be best sellers.But it's not a bad story, you know. If you read it with a light spirit and less expectation than me, I bet you'll enjoy it even more than I did.↠ 3 stars",55,2
588369,A Place Called Here,Reading_ Tamishly,"3,930",2159,3,"August 20, 2022","I wanted a better story than this. ***When blurbs are more interesting than the actual story***""Perhaps because I had spent so many years turning my life upside down and looking for everything, I had forgotten to look for myself.""The story starts with the main character getting lost early in the morning while she was jogging.This is the story going backwards to happened to her life in general before getting lost and what happened after she did. Some other side characters come along who seemed unreal and I don't want to think they were in their right minds.I guess this book tried to discuss about mental health with a twist of some psychological mystery thriller plot. Well, the writing is fine. It's the lack of character development, they all sound like teenagers till the end. Also, there's lack of plot direction that made the story a little too slow and uneventful. It dragged a lot in between.The first half is quite interesting in terms of building up the plot. However, I had a hard time accepting the idea of a group of adults getting lost and being there away from their former lives for four decades. If it was a ""The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari"" kind of story, I would have been really happy knowing what kind of book I was picking up.But then again, I love the idea of the village which played a huge part of the book.The blurb made it sound like a thriller. I feel betrayed. It started out really good I mean. That handsome therapist. But it's problematic with what followed. No. Not a fan of making out with a very much younger client.The parents thought it was a good idea to send their teenage child to a therapist when she's not getting the kind of help she needed but because he had ""nice eyes.""It's really uncomfortable to read the parts with the sixteen year old and the older guy flirting. It's creepy for the guy to say such things and say such things. Cringe!The writing is accessible, easy to get into and not repetitive. There are lines which speaks a lot to the reader when it comes to life and emotions.But the book could have been a hell lotta shorter.I would suggest you to pick up this book when you want to pick up a chick lit kind of book during a lazy summer day and read about new relationships, found family kind of stories otherwise don't trust the blurb and pick it up expecting a totally engrossing, dark thrilling read (no, I made that mistake already). The main character/narrator is really unlikeable and it doesn't get better at all anywhere.There's another character called Jack who seemed like someone who would make up a bigger portion in the story and make some kind of impact for the plot. But sadly his character wasn't given the depth and importance as much as it was made to believe. Every character introduced is either lost or has someone near and dear to them lost.I really wish this story was written so much better and the characters more interesting and mature. It had so much potential.I know how disturbed and sad it is for them, but, sorry to say this, the adult characters are all like clueless middle grades.",44,N/A
588369,A Place Called Here,Runa,597,33,5,"May 29, 2009","I regret to say that I received this book two years ago and just now managed to actually read it. It was my first ARC and I put it aside and it sat at the very bottom of my TBR pile for the longest time. Until this time of year, when I've been trying desperately to get everything out of that box and I finally decided to give this seemingly thick, impossible-to-get-through book a shot. Boy, do I hate myself for waiting so long to read such a literary work of genius. Remember in your school days, when teachers always told you to ""show, not tell""? Cecelia Ahern does this, and does it flawlessly, with writing that is not at all awkward like much ""good"" writing seems to be, nor is it childish. Everything flows. All the words fit together as if they were each handpicked to play the part they are assigned. Coupled together with crazy good characterization, a plot as unique and captivating as they get, this contemporary fantasy should be a must-read for anyone considering themselves a true reader. As lengthy as it is, I got through this book in one long sitting, absolutely refusing to put it down. Cecelia Ahern is the literary genius I have been searching for.Rating: 5/5",43,3
588369,A Place Called Here,Aisyah ♡,220,50,2,"September 24, 2017","I read this years ago, it was actually my first Cecelia Ahern novel. That should have been a big warning for me about how pointless her book can be sometimes, this one included. I remember it was about random things that just kept disappearing. It was boring, not a lot of action going on. Kinda like a sock missing in the washing machine. Ooo... mysterious. ",28,8
588369,A Place Called Here,Michelle,"1,331",106,5,"July 22, 2022",Where does that other sock disappear too? Where do all our lost items go? Such a unique premise and another cute read from Cecelia Ahern.Five stars.,23,N/A
588369,A Place Called Here,Sarah,"1,043",118,3,"January 17, 2020","For my full review, visit me at https://mrsbrownsbooks.wordpress.com/...Riiiiight. Well, this was an odd one. Reading the blurb, I though Ahern was writing metaphorically about a place that lost things end up. Nope. I was very wrong. The result? An odd story that I just couldn’t settle to throughout the narrative.For my full review, visit me at https://mrsbrownsbooks.wordpress.com/...",19,N/A
588369,A Place Called Here,Lee,15,4,4,"May 2, 2011","Light enough that it didn't require deep thought, interesting enough to keep me turning pages, yet not so gripping that I couldn't put it down when I needed to sleep.The story is about Sandy Shortt, who is something of a misfit. She is extremely tall, for one thing, in sharp contrast to her surname. She is also very logical and organized, and has a compulsion to search for missing things - and people. It all started when her neighbor Jenny-May vanishes when they are both ten years old.By the time the story starts, Sandy runs a missing persons agency. She has reunited various lost family members, but there are still several unsolved cases which she has studied extensively.Then Sandy herself disappears, and finds herself in a different world: one filled with people and objects that have mysteriously gone missing from the real world.It's bizarre and surreal... and yet somehow the story works. In this strange other world there are socks, phones, wallets, even sofas... all of which have vanished without trace. There are also some of the people whose cases Sandy was working on. They have settled down, sometimes even married and had children, accepting their new lives after they've been there for a while.The writing is very good; the story delightful, and unexpectedly moving in places. It's also strangely believable - it doesn't feel like fantasy at all. ",18,3
588369,A Place Called Here,jelly frogs,192,98,2,"June 13, 2015","Interesting premise, about where missing objects go. The whole thing had lots of potential, but I got so bored halfway through. I finally snapped and decided I didn't really care about Sandy's missing sock or Sandy herself, who goes missing (oh the irony) and began skim-reading. The concept itself that these missing things and people go somewhere where cultures and such coexist and people live in harmony and (lost) food pops up just like that to fill all bellies was SO ridiculous. Sounds more like Children's fiction to me. And honestly, don't these adults have better things to do? Like, I don't know, build a life for themselves instead of acting like complete lunatics obsessed over missing things. Just saying.",11,2
588369,A Place Called Here,Sam,28,3,2,"October 21, 2009","I bought this book in 2007, I started reading it immediatly. But I never liked it enough to keep reading. I decided on reading it again last month and I feel like it took me ages to read. I really liked the concept of someone who hates it when things go missing. Who starts a missing persons agency and then goes missing herself to end up on the place where the missing things and persons go. I was very excited to read this book from Cecilia as I loved ps;i love you. But the beginning really bored me. I forced myself to read it again a year later, failed and forced myself to read it again last month. It did get better, I liked her time at that place called Here. And I would find myself really feeling for her and Jack Ruttle. Cause I was dying to find out what would happend, if Jack would find his brother and most importantly Sandy. And if Sandy would get home and find the 'Here' place so she could 'free' all the missing persons.But the ending, I think, was horrible. I would have loved to know what happened to her 'missing' friends. If they would actually search for the 'Here' place. I'm kinda dissapointed in the ending.It has like 387 pages. Which should take me about 2 days to read. But it took me almost 2 months to read it. Not her best work.",6,1 comment
588369,A Place Called Here,alterego_bookaholic  (Upasana Singh),124,14,5,"September 2, 2020",“Strength and Hope” are the only thing to cling to when someone close to you is Missing. Sandy Shortt has made it her life’s mission to find missing people ever since her class mate Jenny-May Butler disappeared. There is so much pain and unanswered questions when someone just vanishes into thin air. Can she find those people? Will she ever be able to let go? Are the missing people the link to her own missing self? After reading this book i really wish there would be a “A Place Called Here” or a zealous Sandy for every family that goes through this. ,6,N/A
