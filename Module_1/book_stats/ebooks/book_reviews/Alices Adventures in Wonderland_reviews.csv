60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,emma,"1,781",42700,5,"September 14, 2022","welcome to...ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN SEPTEMBERLAND.might be my best month/title pun since middlemarch march.we are BACK (and a week late) for Project Long Classics, in which elle and i tackle a long intimidating classic in small chunks for an entire month.however, this book is not long, and it's not intimidating, and personally i will be reading this AND the sequel at a chapter-ish a day.join our book club to join the project!! follow on instagram here or join the discussion here.DAY 1: DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLEas we start things off, i'll include the cheesy declaration of love i wrote when announcing this pick in our book club discord:this is my favorite book of all time. this teeny tiny children's classic is so dear to me - whether you want a light fairytaley read or a thematically rich toughie you can analyze all day long, you can find either experience in this.filled with whimsy, imagination, and the bittersweet nostalgia of dreams and childhood, i never tire of this - and i get something new from it with every read. at one chapter a day, this and its sequel (THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE), which i see as a continuation of the first more than a separate book, can be read in 24 days!bleh. gross. look how sweet and earnest.DAY 2: THE POOL OF TEARSit's actually day 8. i'm terribly slumped - the kind where it literally never occurs to you to read and then when it does you're like...am i physically capable of doing this? how did i ever make these words enter my head?if anything can heal me it's this. update: not yet, but we did get our first curiouser and curiouser...slay...DAY 3: A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALEthe titular mouse's tale / mouse tail pun here...one of the greatest of all time i dare say...DAY 4: THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILLi don't know how the little EAT ME cakes manage to sound so good with virtually no description, but they do. maybe because these look so goddamn delicious?or maybe just because i like cake.DAY 5: ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLARfolks...it's day 12. i've never been slumped like this and at this point i am Frightened. my goodreads challenge is beginning to appear to stare back at me, like the void or one of those scary crusty small white dogs.but this book is simply...everything.DAY 6: PIG AND PEPPERthe baby-turning-into-a-pig thing is honestly objectively terrifying. especially when alice is like ""this baby is like a star-fish"" and looks down and boom.but! cheshire cat appearance. and ""we're all mad here."" huge quote for people with watercolor tattoos and hot topic graphic tees.DAY 7: A MAD TEA-PARTYICONS ALERT!!! a real heavy hitter. maybe my favorite chapter. what can i say? not all my opinions are unpopular.DAY 8: THE QUEEN'S CROQUET-GROUNDmonarchs, am i right.DAY 9: THE MOCK TURTLE'S STORYwell, it's actually day 14, so i might as well mess around and finish this book already. i wanted to relish it but my dumb suddenly-illiterate brain refuses to allow me to!also: ""Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very  ugly."" vibes.DAY 10: THE LOBSTER QUADRILLEthis one is a ton of fun but impossible to compete in a universe that contains the walrus and the carpenter.DAY 11: WHO STOLE THE TARTS?let's go to court!!!!!sooooo important to remember that even in a nonsense-world, nothing is more illogical and annoying than outdated monarchical structures and the incompetence of the judicial system.DAY 12: ALICE'S EVIDENCEand it was all a dream!!!or was it?or does it even matter at all?(no.)perfect book.OVERALLi have this wholeeeee five star review below, but i'll quickly say that nothing makes me happy and fulfilled and whimsical like this book does. and that's my ideal way to be.my favorite forever!rating: 5------------------------original reviewTHIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK.No qualifier. No excuse. No “one of my favorites.” This one is it, y’all.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Well, also Through the Looking Glass. But THAT’S PRACTICALLY THE SECOND HALF OF THE SAME BOOK. (And other examples of my inability to make decisions or commit in any way to anything.)I currently have 18 copies of this book. I’ve attempted to read it at least annually for the past three years. And by “annually,” I mean I last revisited this book about nine months ago.But hey, it was a different year then, technically speaking.How do I even review this? I don’t know where to begin. (Just a heads up that my obsessive personality is going to become verrrrry clear as this review progresses. I’m not proud. This is who I am, you guys. I was a member of the fandoms of some teen pop sensation or other for nearly ten consecutive years. I’m no longer thirteen but I still need an outlet. Honestly I’m quite afraid that if I don’t have an obsession, I’ll become a drug addict. Lots of pent up energy.)Well, I’ll say that I always, always, always feel enveloped by this book. I have never picked this up without feeling instantly submersed in Wonderland. And it’s really my favorite place to be. It’s hard to feel unhappy when you’re in the greatest setting ever created.And oh yeah, there’s that. I firmly believe this is the most amazing and beautiful and confusing and curious setting of all time. It’s immersive, and it’s strange, and it’s so unique and fantastic and creative and I love it so much. I can come up with even more loosely positive adjectives if that overwhelming number didn’t suffice.Wonderland is my Hogwarts. While many readers pray their letters just got lost in the mail, I’m constantly hoping I’ll see a white rabbit in a waistcoat and fall down, down, down into what must be the center of the earth.I love Alice and her curiosity. She may also be my favorite character ever. She’s funny and sweet and childish and such a blast to read about. Her reactions to everything are so, so funny. Her curiosity always outweighs confusion and fear. I’d like to wake up one day and be Alice. I’ll likely become one of those creeps who pays millions for plastic surgery in order to “resemble” some celebrity or other.On an unrelated note, anyone have millions of dollars they’re trying to get rid of?I’m also fiercely protective of this book. I constantly pick up retellings only to be utterly disappointed. (Like Heartless. Get out of here with your shoddy Carroll-stealing.) DO NOT, DO NOT! GET ME STARTED ON THE TIM BURTON FILM ADAPTATION. Horrific. Alice, an adult? Alice, engaged? Alice FIGHTING THE GODDAMN JABBERWOCK?But I do love the original animated Disney adaptation. There’s a certain quality to the book that’s captured within that film, which I haven’t found recreated in any other retelling or use of the setting or adaptation.Oh, and one more thing, while I’m here.THIS BOOK ISN’T ABOUT DRUGS, YOU SURFACE-LEVEL INTERPRETERS OF SYMBOLISM. It’s not that easy, boo.In the words of BBC News, “[the drug] references may say more about the people making them than the author.”Lewis Carroll isn’t thought to have been a user of drugs, the Caterpillar was smoking tobacco, and the mushroom is no more magic than the various cakes Alice eats.Honestly, the drug reading is simple and boring. It’s such a stretch to attempt to read each character as a different substance. And scrolling through countless quasi-psychedelic GIFs to find the actual ones was irritating, too. Ah, yes, real art: taking images from a 1951 children’s film but messing with the colors and movement until it looks like nothing more than a trigger for epilepsy. Enough, Tumblr.Alice in Wonderland carries as much or as little significance as you want it to. It’s everything from a mindless romp in an imaginative land to a depiction of the effects of a ruthlessly authoritarian system of justice. Just have fun with it.And please, for the love of God, stop applying your weird psychedelic edits to a Disney movie.Note on the audiobook: This time around, I listened to the audiobook, to switch things up. Scarlett Johansson read it. I loved her funny accents and hated her overly-acted narration. A mixed bag.Bottom line: This is my favoritest and I doubt it will be dethroned anytime soon. Come at me, every other book.------------reread updateswhen I find myself in times of troubleLewis Carroll comes to mespeaking words of wisdom""just reread""",808,78

  The Written Review
 I should've read this one sooner  
  “But I don’t want to go among mad people,"" Alice remarked.""Oh, you can’t help that,"" said the Cat: ""we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.""
I needed an adequate amount of nostalgia to guide me through this level of crazy. 
  Little Alice fell downthe hole, bumped her headand bruised her soul!
Everyone knows this story. Alice falls down the rabbit hole and into Wonderland - a place wholly unexpected, trivial and unforgettable. She meets several good friends (like the White Rabbit and the Cheshire Cat) and a few enemies (The Red Queen) as she stumbles her way through.Reading this book for the first time as an adult leaves me bewildered, vaguely amused and mostly lost. I'm now worrying whether I'm too old for children's stories anymore (I briefly reread some of my faves - HP, Winnie the Pooh and Charlotte's Web - and have concluded it's not me, just that book).It's all so illogical and confusing. Alice (and everyone else in this novel) constantly contradicts themselves and each other. The whole thing is utter nonsense! Though, there are a few good puns: 
  No wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.
 Ah well. I will try it again some day just to see if I was being a grump on the day I read it and I plan to read this to my future-kids to see if their youth will allow them to interpret this more positively. After all, if Ronan Lynch from [Book: The Raven Boys] loves it then I will force myself too.Audiobook Comments Read by Alan Bennett - and he was a pretty good narrator too. But as much as l I tried to listen to this on audiobook, the text was just tooo confusing. I kept losing track of the story. I gave up and decided to read it instead. That was a good choice - lots of fun pictures!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_reads",246,61

Sutton,651,824,4,"March 24, 2021","""It's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then""3rd read: The quote struck me as appropriate to the world we're living in now. Not only have we changed, but the world has changed in the last few days and weeks. I guess these kind of observations are what I get from reading Alice in Wonderland during a pandemic! That said, this reading (actually an audible reading from Scarlett Johansson who did a fantastic job) reinforced the timeless quality of Lewis Carroll's celebrated adventure. I also recognized how many great quotes there are in this book. Had fun going back down the rabbit hole! ---I'd read Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland a few years ago; however, I just felt like picking it up again and I'm glad I did. I don't know why, but I enjoyed Alice's observations and the humor more this time. There's also something that's fun and a bit surprising when we're reading something (like Peter Pan or The Wizard of Oz) we thought we knew really well (because we've been exposed to the stories for so long even if we haven't read the actual story). I know my ratings are always subjective based on when and where I've read a specific book. It's clear that I was ready to have fun down the rabbit hole! Changing my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.

Sorry. I guess I just don't love the nonsensical fun of this as much as everyone else seems to love it.

60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,Vit Babenco,"1,374",3187,5,"January 13, 2022","In spite of being written for children – originally, a young girl named Alice – Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland influenced the entire grownup literature.On finding herself in the Wonderland, Alice encounters a lot of incredibly curious creatures…They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank – the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.Volatility is a first rule of the Wonderland… Everything is prone to change unexpectedly an unpredictably…The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.“Who are you?” said the Caterpillar.This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “I – I hardly know, sir, just at present – at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.”And with every new step in the Wonderland, everything grows yet madder…“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right paw round, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.”“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’re all mad here. I’m mad.

60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,Peter,"2,464",438,5,"January 12, 2021","What a classic. I read this book so many years ago that I wanted to have a close look at it again (okay a tea caddy with a quote from this novel inspired me for a re-reading to be honest). Well, Alice's marvelous adventures will never turn old. So many great characters she meets here (LOL about the Cheshire cat or the Mad Hatter), so many allusions and memorable settings. Lovely book. A bit weird but with humor and situations I still love as much as I did as a kid. Today I see the book from a different point of view (irony and behind the scene wisdom) but I still enjoyed my trip back in time. ""Begin at the beginning,"" the King said gravely, ""and go on till you come to the end;"" you also should do so reading this real classic. Highly recommended.",143,12
60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,MISS Petra to you!  Say yes ma'am,"2,383",33900,5,"June 3, 2020","This book makes perfect sense if you had a misspent youth and went in for psychedelic substances. Just as Lewis Carroll undoubtedly did. Well he certainly liked opium.If you ever tripped out getting bigger and smaller, things that half disappear in the air and inanimate objects suddenly coming to life were part of the fun of the trip.Lewis Carroll wrote Alice as a children's fantasy, but I believe he and his friends must have had a quiet smile at no one guessing the source of his inspiration. Or perhaps laughed out loud at the magic mushroom with the caterpillar sitting on it smoking his hookah, and the little bottle of 'drink me' (an imperative - just don't say 'No!') and other drug references____________________I added this book in June 2008 finally reviewed it in 2016 (extended 'review to come'). Some librarian has changed the book I reviewed into an Alice in Wonderland abridged edition illustrated like a graphic novel. I'm really upset. So I'm adding this edtion which Isn't the same one I read as a little girl but is at least the full text with the original illustrations by Tenniel. This is the original review.",131,16

    “If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk about wasting it. 
  
There are so many great things to say about this story. For me, as a work of fantasy, it is on par with The Chronicles of Narnia, Peter Pan and The Wizard of Oz in terms of its creative imagination.  These stories seem to centre on the idea of escape, escape from a boring reality in which the protagonist enters a world of exciting, and sometimes terrifying, adventure as they walk away from their old mundane life. This is a popular trope and here it works very well, Alice jumps down a rabbit hole and enters a truly insane world that makes little sense. “In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.” Of all the fantasy worlds that work around this idea, this is by far the most bizarre I have read about. To put in mildly, the things Alice encounters feel hallucinogenic as if the mind has conjured them up whilst being intoxicated. Because as strange as it all seems, there is always a touch of the real about them. And I think this is because Lewis Carroll draws on real life experiences to bring his world to life.The Mad Hatter, of course, is the best example. Although he only plays a small role here, and the movie versions certainly capitalise on his colourful character, he still stands out within the narrative: his character is the most memorable part of the story. He is only referred to as that name once, and he never identifies with it, though the name is distinctively his. 
  “How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another.”
He is the embodiment of true madness: dementia. And I did a little research on him and the origins of his character. In Victorian society, hatters often went mad because of the hat making process. They handled chemicals that caused what we now identify as dementia. Prolonged exposure to such substances degraded their minds to such a degree. So, in a way, he embodies a little piece of history with his quirkiness.So I had a lot of fun here. This was actually my first ever read of this story. I've seen the films but never actually picked this up, it's certainly a quaint piece of madness to brighten your day with its nonsensical nature. Facebook| Twitter| Insta| Academia",129,11
60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,Johann (jobis89),614,4239,2,"April 28, 2017","""We're all mad here""I'm not going to insult your intelligence by giving a plot summary for this book as I think every person on the planet knows the premise. However, for the sake of completion and satisfying my OCD tendencies... Alice is a young girl who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world, meeting lots of weird and peculiar characters. And that's it.Well, the Mad Hatter isn't wrong. I started this book excited at the premise of reading a classic that I don't recall ever having read before. Within about ten pages, my excitement had quickly waned. I've come to the conclusion that people who love this book must have fallen in love with the book as a child and therefore reading this book will trigger feelings of nostalgia and memories of childhood. Because I simply hated every minute of reading this book. I went to bed every night and would find myself procrastinating on my phone instead of getting stuck into my book like I normally would.I don't enjoy nonsense. I like things to be logical and follow some kind of structure... I guess that's the scientist in me. Of course, not everything can be logical in horror books etc, but this was like a different level of ridiculousness. Nothing made any sense, things were all over the place. We were just jumping around everywhere and I just wanted the experience to be over. If this book wasn't so short, I think it would have became a DNF for me.Oh, and Alice literally has to the sassiest, cheekiest, rudest little girl I've ever encountered in literature. What a brat. I just wanted to put her in her place for the entirety of the novel. Nope, I hate Alice.The only highlight for me was the illustrations, as they are simply beautiful. So I apologise to all lovers of Alice in Wonderland but it's just not for me. I'll give 1 star for the story as I just can't allow myself to give zero stars... and I'll give 1 star for the illustrations. So that's 2 stars out of 5 from me! And a reading experience I'd like to forget.",129,19
60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,James,155,36,5,"February 6, 2011","Having just finished Alice in Wonderland, the first thing that occurs to me is that I wish I had read it years ago. I've known the story of Alice for years thanks to Disney and the Mad Hatter on Batman, but for some reason I didn't get around to reading this as a child. While I expected to like it, I never realized what a joy this book would be. Carroll was a logician, so it should come as no surprise that he uses his expertise in that field to create many hilarious logical fallacies. But what interested me the most was the prose; I could talk for a long time of the clean, beautiful concision of Carroll's writing and of the brilliance of his word games and puns, which obviously influenced Vladimir Nabokov (who composed a Russian translation of Alice). The way in which Carroll's narrative voice addresses the absurd events reminded me of Kafka's Metamorphosis. Why some would reject the former's unique literary genius while praising the latter's can be explained by the snobbery of those who would reject a masterpiece simply because it's a ""children' book.""These things interested the adult reader in me, but Alice is really for children of all ages. Thanks to the animated movie, I knew the characters and I felt like I was being reunited with old friends. I especially felt this during the Mad Tea Party, which I think must rank among the most brilliant comic scenes in English literature. However, Alice proves that books for children need not be dumbed down or sentimentalized. There are some dark undercurrents to the excellent humor (The Queen is obsessed with beheading, to use just the most famous example). And the beautiful concluding paragraph is a startling, Shakespearean meditation on childhood, age, and eventual womanhood. I admit that was a wonderful surprise. And then of course there's the drug use of the caterpillar and Carroll's suggested pedophiliac obsession with young girls. But people who approach Alice as psychedelic literature or a creepy Lolita story, I think, miss the point. However, these questions do add to the depth of the reading experience.Alice in Wonderland is indeed a rare kind of book: one which can entertain and enlighten both the child and the adult. Carroll's glittering novel hasn't been dimmed in the slightest by time, something that can't be said of the works of many of his contemporaries. Alice's adventures will doubtless fascinate us for untold years to come. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go listen to White Rabbit. ",101,3
60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,Emily May,"1,921",29000,3,"March 1, 2017","I'm still not sure whether I think Lewis Carroll created a fantastic piece of fantasy or a great big pile of nonsense. I suspect it's a combination of the two. I like some of Alice's adventures - really, how could I not? - but Wonderland was always leaning a bit towards the negative side of bizarre for me.",97,1 comment
60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,Irena BookDustMagic,601,468,5,"August 23, 2020","I think it was a good choice for me to reread one of my favorite childhood stories before I read the one I really wanted to: Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.When I was a little girl I LOVED the Disney movie and, since this book has some different aspects, it is no wonder I find the movie to be better.However, it was still a really enjoyable ride everytime I read it.Everlasting quotes are the reason this book is classic, and I love them all!I have always wondered what inspired Lewis Carroll (who was a really strange man so even if I am still wondering the same question, I am not too sure if I want to know the answer) to create this story in his head, and if he was on some kind of drugs while doing that.I mean, Caterpillar smoke from nargila so... that's enough reason to be suspicious.",90,10
60671823,Alices Adventures in Wonderland,Matthew,"1,219",8681,3,"April 7, 2019","If I didn't already know the story and the basic plot points of Alice in Wonderland from movies, books, and other pop culture retellings, I think this book would have been very confusing. I didn't realize how short the Wonderland part of Alice's story is so, despite the bizarre writing, it was a pretty quick read. In fact, if you are really into fairy tales, I imagine this could be a one sitting book.The intro to the book mentioned this being psychedelic fiction. Having grown up frequently seeing art with tie-dyed mushrooms and a hookah smoking caterpillar on top, I was already thinking this book was likely quite a trip. The surreal storylines, bizarre characters, and the consumption of substances by Alice to alter her reality definitely make this a trippy experience.This is one case where I think the movies (at least the ones I have seen) have done a pretty good job stream-lining the story to improve the delivery. The essence of each of Alice's adventures is usually captured perfectly with excessively trippy material edited perfectly so as to not lose the viewer. Not often you can say the movie is better than the book!In the end, it is another classic that I am very glad to have read. Did it blow me away? Not really. Will I be recommending it to others? Not likely. But, if you have always enjoyed the Alice fairy tell - enough to say that you are a fan - I think you have to check out the source material.",76,4
