52327616,A Hint of Magic,Melanie Marsh,462,18,4,"October 23, 2013","A Hint of Magic is the first book in Claire Chilton‚Äôs Demonic Diaries series. In this short story we are given a glimpse into the life of Dora Carradine, the heroine of Demonic Dora. We are introduced to Dora and her family, and some of how Dora fits into (or doesn‚Äôt) her community.  I have mixed feelings about this book. I believe some of them are my own misconceptions so those I will leave out, but give some advice so you don‚Äôt experience the same misconceptions. I read Demonic Dora before I read A Hint of Magic. If you can read A Hint of Magic first, please do. There are several reasons for this.One reason is that the reader is given a better idea of who Dora, and tells us about Dora‚Äôs first experience with magic and witchcraft. The other reason I think it‚Äôs important to read this book first is it has a different feel to it. There are many of the same elements when it comes to character development, which is a good thing, but the overall tone is not as elaborate or crazy action packed as Demonic Dora. My only other ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù is that we are not given enough time in this story to really develop relationships or become invested in the characters. When the title says it‚Äôs a HINT of something, that should be your first clue that it is just a hint into the world we are reading about. I should have paid better attention to that hehe. Definite downside of many short stories, in my opinion.Ok, enough complaining! Let‚Äôs talk about the good. I loved that despite the fact the story was fairly short, we are still given enough of Dora‚Äôs snarky personality to get an impression of what a smart ass she can be. One of my favorite parts of Dora is her sarcasm. Just when you think to yourself, ‚Äúgee, it would have been funny if she said‚Ä¶‚Äù she says it! The overall writing of the story was good. Its got a good storyline, good world building, a good twist at the end. It wasn‚Äôt overly surprising, but it was a surprise to at least some degree. This is a fun story leading up to the super awesome fun time in Demonic Dora I keep going on about. Be sure to check out my review of Demonic Dora either here on Goodreads, or on my blog, http://fangfreakintasticreviews.com If I had not already read Demonic Dora, I would have been dying to find out what was going to happen next. You are given clues that something exciting is about to happen, but you won‚Äôt know what until you read the next book. I would strongly recommend buying A Hint of Magic AND Demonic Dora at the same time so you don‚Äôt have any down time in between and don‚Äôt have to wait to find out what happens next!",5,N/A
52327616,A Hint of Magic,Jagged,729,31,2,"June 29, 2014","This doesn't have a lot to offer. There is no intrigue. The mystery is not mysterious. You are pretty aware of what is happening with the plot at all times. There are no surprises there.The problem is that there is nothing supporting the characters and their actions. There is no sense going on here. Why is Dora looking into demons and hell and witch craft? Why, if she is brought up to be really religious, is she so hell bent on finding evil things to spend her time with? She mentions finding something to believe in, but really, all she looks for is demonic communications. Fine, she wants to be evil, that's great, but why? Where is her character development? She really doesn't have any.Her parents make no sense at all. The way they behave...it's just sloppy and empty.This is supposed to be a comedy, or something. It wasn't very entertaining. I won't be reading further, I need more substance in my reads.I will let it be known that this is the first book I have read in this series. And as this is the first impression, it is really, really lacking.",2,N/A
52327616,A Hint of Magic,Penny Raspenny,286,71,2,"July 8, 2018","I understand where the funny parts where supposed to be, but they weren't that funny...I didn't really enjoy this, but it wasn't bad. Although, it wasn't good either (hence the 1.5*). It was weirdly written, and the plot was too see-through. Dora was a bit annoying for a main character. She was very naive and thoughtless. I guess to a 10 year old girl, this book might have been appealing, but then again this is a fact that makes me worried since it introduces demonic entities as something a bored kid should play with and use for revenge... Like, WTH?  ",2,N/A
52327616,A Hint of Magic,Big Book Theory,325,17,4,"February 9, 2018","At the beginning of the story you would think everything is rather normal and boring in Dora's live - being the minister's daughter. However, this soon changed and my jaw literally dropped when she and her dad got into their first fight. I was hooked then and I could understand her search for something magic and better than what she had. I must wonder then what happens further in the series when now every man in her live seems to disappoint her.",2,N/A

  ""How far are you willing to go for power? Would you dance with the devil?""
I haven't read any of the Demon Diaries books (I got this one because... yeah, you guessed it, it was free), but this short origin story made me want to read them, so I guess it's good?I quite enjoyed how the story unfolded and the small twists along the way, even though the end felt a bit abrupt after the pace of the rest of the story. I also liked the writing style, easy to read and funny. 
  ""Well, I dunno. I mean if the Devil asked me to River Dance, it might be a bit of a problem. I don't think my legs move that fast."" She tried not to imagine the Devil River Dancing across a stage, but it was too late. The image was already firmly lodged in her mind.
I'm not too sure about the characters though, as I was constantly going from liking Dora to being a bit annoyed by her. I'm guessing reading the main books of the series might help to get to know her better though, so that's what I'm hoping to get from them. (Well, that, and some actual real magic.)I guess I'll see you around in a (hopefully) near future for Demonic Dora.",1 like,N/A

The book is well written, this is the first book I have read by Claire Chilton but it won't be the last as I enjoyed the way she wrote this book.",N/A,N/A

After you read enough of them, this genre, you start to wonder if there is an algorithm and some computer is spitting them out. What's different about it? No real magic but there are demons. It's two hours I'll never get back.",N/A,N/A

Her father is a pastor, she hates religion, her mother a 'dancer'. This was a short read because I couldn't sleep, but this was laugh out loud funny & I'll definitely be looking to read more about the exploits of Dora üòÇ",N/A,N/A
