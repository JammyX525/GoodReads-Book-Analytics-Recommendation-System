310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Nathan,233,185,2,"September 20, 2007","I know I'm out on my own on this one, but I detest this book. I really think it glorifies whining to an extent never before seen in the human condition. Everyone I know loves this book, and I know I am in a minority here. But Christ... That this book is so popular with people in my age bracket and not so popular with people older or younger really makes me wonder if it is part of the problem or a reflection of the boring, whiny apathy of my generation. But if this book has any redeemable aspects at all, it is that it highlights just how lazy and worthless my generation is. It's reflected in the reverence people my age give this book, a book whose central lesson seems to be ""whining is funny, and doing things is bad"". For dark, astounding irony about inaction and the parodoxes of a corrupt society, read Catch-22 or some of the more comical writers of astroyphysics tomes. Confederacy of Dunces is the Forrest Gump of literature and I'd like to never have another conversation about this book as long as I live.NC",836,184
310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Megha,79,1047,5,"June 26, 2012","One fine morning Fortuna spun my wheel of luck and put me on a flight to NYC. The person who was sitting next to me, refusing to indulge in modern day perversities like movies, pulled out his book and sat down reading. He must have been enjoying it immensely, because he kept laughing out loud every now and then. Soon he realized that some people had started turning around to give him weird looks. Poor guy didn't have an option but to put the book down. But Fortuna being the degenerate wanton that she can sometimes be, was in a mood to play a cruel joke on him. Even after he had put the book down, he couldn't help suddenly bursting out into laughter. More stares. More embarrassment.That was when I noticed that the book he had been reading was A Confederacy of Dunces. Having read it only a week earlier, I could understand that he wasn't a nutcase.(To those who haven't read this book yet):-WARNING: 'A Confederacy of Dunces' is extremely hilarious and is known to have caused uncontrollable laughter in several cases. Read it in public at your own risk!",762,70
310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,sarah,11,102,5,"April 6, 2007","There are a lot of ways to judge people, but I find that opinion of this book is one of the most accurate and efficient. With very few exceptions, I've found that how much I like someone is strongly correlated with how much they enjoy the book. Is it their favorite book ever, omg? Well, they're probably either a best friend, a comrade whom I hold in worship-approximating esteem, or my cool cousin or uncle or something like that. Do they not ""get"" it or find it boring? You aren't my type, sorry. To me, this book is like the little yellow canary that you send down a mine shaft to know whether to run the other way or not. I re-read Confederacy piecemeal on my grinding morning commutes last fall. If you've ever ridden the DC metro at 7:30am you know that the cars are full of serious, silent business people. So, when I couldn't keep myself from cracking up, I was very obviously that weird possibly-schizophrenic girl that every user of public transportation dreads. I tried to be professional, but Christ, this book is FUNNY, and I can't help myself. And really, who cares what those people think anyway -- I'm sure Ignatius would find their mere existence is an affront to theology and geometry. ",374,31
310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Mary Catherine,310,23,1,"December 29, 2007","I hated this book. I almost gave up after the first 20 pages, but I decided to stick with it and give it a chance. Wrong. My first instinct was correct!The only thing that might have saved this for me was if the main character Ignatius faced a long, slow, painful death. There was absolutely nothing about him that I found redeeming or appealing. Has there ever been a more annoying, obnoxious character in literature? If so, I don't want to know. I had heard that this was supposed to be an hilarious book; I don't think I laughed once. I'm left to wonder if this book would have this much hype if it wasn't for the story of its author. (He killed himself; his mom found this manuscript and got someone to publish it. Then it won the Pulitzer.) Truly, in the words of the great Dorothy Parker, this is not a book to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force. ",349,43
310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Matt,899,27900,2,"April 26, 2016","This is the book that almost broke my book club. John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces is as famous for its back-story as it is for its content. It was published posthumously in 1980, over a decade after Toole ended his own life by carbon monoxide poisoning. Despite having been earlier rejected by publishers, the book went on to win the Pulitzer Prize. A Confederacy of Dunces is a rambling, aimless, comedic novel centered on Ignatius J. Reilly, a buffoonish overweight man-child with poor fashion sense, worse social skills, and deplorable hygiene. Through 400 pages – which is relatively long for a book in which nothing happens – we follow Ignatius through various minor misadventures: Ignatius goes to a bar; Ignatius gets a job at Levy Pants and attempts to unionize the factory; Ignatius sells hotdogs; Ignatius – in what passes for a large set piece – attempts to use a gay soiree as a political rally. Comedy is all about personal, subjective reactions. Thus, any artistic medium that relies heavily on comedy is likely to engender varied responses. For my book club, at least, those responses were all passionate. It was my buddy Colin who picked the book. He’d loved it as an eighteen year-old; now, fourteen years later, he thought it a propitious time to revisit it. Rule 1 of Book Club – at least our book club – is that the person picking the book has to have read it before. He is then forced to “defend” the book at our bimonthly meeting. In his opening statement, Colin declared his undying love. A hilarious romp with an indelible central character. The salvos came fast and fierce. The group was roughly split on loving or hating the book, and responses lived at those two extremes. Colin was the chief defender. I was his chief inquisitor. No one at our meeting had an indifferent response. Eventually, the others got tired, their attention drawn by the frozen pizza and beer. The debate came down to Colin and me battling away over the inherent worth of A Confederacy of Dunces while the others looked for a way to exit quietly. I’ll tell you what I told him. I hated it. Hate is a pretty strong word. Perhaps a bit imprecise as well. Overall, I strongly disliked the book. But I hated everyone in it. Based on the epigram by Jonathan Swift, it is clear that Toole’s title refers to Ignatius’s worldview: that his inflated sense of intelligence, his delusions of grandeur, and his unrelenting condescension has created a paradigm in which he believes that every other person in this world is an idiot. And what is more, he thinks this idiot-filled world is in league against him. I took the title differently. I assumed it to be Toole’s worldview. His evident intelligence, his publishing failures, and his depression clearly combined to lead him to his unfortunate end. Reading this book, I got the sense that Toole really thought himself a genius – one destined to be misunderstood. To that end, the “confederacy of dunces” consists of us – the hapless, clueless world. There is a strong disgust for humanity permeating every page. There is not a single likeable character. There is not a single person walking the streets of Toole’s New Orleans who shows a flash of wit, warmth, or love. The pro-Dunces members of my book club pointed out that I have a tendency towards “likeable” characters. I considered the possibility, and though there is a grain of truth, I don’t think it’s entirely accurate. It was not the characters’ un-likability that struck me; it was their creator’s disdain. Toole appears to despise his own characters. How could I feel otherwise? Ignatius is a tiresome, boorish person to follow. He is disruptive, dishonest, and frankly disgusting. His interactions with others are marked by a tendency towards sociopathy. He is written for laughs – or so I am told, by those who found him funny – but he is clearly suffering from undiagnosed mental illnesses. But rather than seeing him to a hospital, we have to follow him as he plods and farts his way through each day, griping about his “valve,” unable to reach the tiniest bit of insight. The side characters are just as bad. Ignatius’s widowed mother Irene is an alcoholic enabler – and so immensely irritating that I nearly defenestrated my copy of this book on several occasions. Ignatius’s long-distance “girlfriend” – for lack of a better word – Myrna is a sex-crazed New York beatnik who attempts to solve Ignatius’s problems by analyzing his sex life. (To be fair, her correspondence with Ignatius is fairly hilarious). Mr. Gonzalez, the manager at Levy Pants, is a clueless bungler who doesn’t realize that Ignatius is filing things in the trash. The owner of Levy Pants, Gus Levy, is dumb, indifferent, and put upon by his wife, a trite, do-it-yourself psychoanalyst. Patrolman Angel Mancuso seems to have a decent enough heart, but he is such an inept milquetoast that it’s impossible to care about him. The one character with a semblance of actual (rather than perceived) aptitude is Burma Jones, a black porter at the club Night of Joy. He works there for Lana Lee and puts up with her unpleasantness so that he isn’t arrested for vagrancy. Burma rises above the crowd with his ability – not to be taken lightly in this novel – to accurately observe life as it swirls around him. He is, in other words, relatively sane. But even this character is marred by the black stereotypes and tropes he is forced to carry. Honestly, I sometimes enjoy trashing a book. Especially a trashy book that deserves it. I don’t feel that way in this instance. For one, the background – Toole’s publishing woes, his death – is sad. For another, he was a man of obvious talent. A Confederacy of Dunces is a masterpiece in that it absolutely achieves – with great skill – exactly what it sets out to achieve. I simply did not like it. After our book club disassembled, I didn't hear from Colin for awhile. I wondered if I hadn’t assaulted his favorite book a bit too hard. Books are personal. Sharing them is a risk. (Especially with our book club. We don’t stab in the back; we stab in the front). I almost texted him to apologize. But his wife was also expecting a baby any day, so it occurred to me that he had other things on his mind. Then, the other night, I was taking an evening stroll when I ran into him and his wife as they walked around, trying to jumpstart labor. I was going to ask them about baby-related stuff, but Colin cut me off immediately. “I’ve been thinking about A Confederacy of Dunces,” he said. “I���m more certain than ever that you’re completely f---ing wrong. It’s a great book. It changed my life.”“Did it really change your life?” I asked. “Well, no. But it’s really damn funny.” So, there you have the dissenting opinion. I didn't care for A Confederacy of Dunces. But maybe I’m just completely f---ing wrong. ",335,12

310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Michelle,139,46,2,"May 17, 2008","I thought the book was ok. One of my old boyfriends recommended it to me, and while I was reading it I told him what an asshole I thought Ignatius J. Reilly was, and that I was sick of hearing about his valve. He got pissed off at me and told me that I didn't get it. He said Ignatius was a misunderstood genius stuck in a shitty town with no one who understood him. To be honest, my eyes kind of glazed over and I don't remember the rest of his rant, but I finished the book anyway. I think the most valuable thing I learned was to lie on my left side to fart.

310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"August 31, 2021","A Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole A Confederacy of Dunces is a picaresque novel by American novelist John Kennedy Toole which reached publication in 1980, eleven years after Toole's suicide. Published through the efforts of writer Walker Percy (who also contributed a foreword) and Toole's mother, the book became first a cult classic, then a mainstream success; it earned Toole a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981, and is now considered a canonical work of modern literature of the Southern United States. Toole wrote the novel in 1963 during his last few months in Puerto Rico.Ignatius Jacques Reilly is an overweight and unemployed thirty-year-old with a degree in Medieval History who still lives with his mother, Irene Reilly. He lives in utter loathing of the world around him, which he feels has lost the values of geometry and theology. One afternoon, Reilly's mother drives him 'downtown in the old Plymouth, and while she was at the doctor’s seeing about her arthritis, Ignatius had bought some sheet music at Werlein’s for his trumpet and a new string for his lute.' While Reilly waits for his mother, Officer Angelo Mancuso approaches Reilly and demands that the latter produce identification. Affronted and outraged by Mancuso's unwarranted zeal and officious manner, Reilly protests his innocence to the crowd while denouncing the city's vices and the graft of the local police. An elderly man, Claude Robichaux, takes Reilly's part, denouncing Officer Mancuso and the police as communiss. In the resulting uproar, Reilly and his embarrassed mother escape, taking refuge in a bar in case Officer Mancuso is still in hot pursuit. In the bar, Mrs Reilly then drinks too much. As a result, she crashes her car. ...تاریخ نخستین خوانش: یکی از روزهای سال 2014میلادیعنوان: اتحادیه ی ابلهان، اثر: جان کندی تول؛ برگردان: پیمان خاکسار؛ تهران، نشر به نگار، 1391؛ در 467ص؛ شابک 9789646332836؛ چاپ چهارم تا ششم 1392، چاپ دیگر تهران، زاوش، 1392؛ شابک 9786007283189؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، نشر چشمه، 1393؛ شابک9786002292742؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 20مسبک نگارش اتحادیه ابلهان، رندنامه یا همان «پیکارسک» است؛ چکیده: داستان زندگی پسر جوان عظیم‌ الجثه‌ ای به نام «ایگنیشس» است، که با مادرش زندگی می‌کند، و روحیه آرمانگرایانه دارد؛ در عین حال فردی تنبل است، که مدام برای خانواده و شهر خود دردسرساز می‌شود؛ او از جامعه مصرف‌ گرای آمریکایی بیزار است، و جهان امروز را سیرکی سیار میبیند؛ یک مأمور مخفی دست و پا چلفتی، که برای تنبیه به مستراح ایستگاه اتوبوس تبعید شده، پیرمرد عاشق‌ پیشه‌ ای که فکر می‌کند همه پلیس‌ها کمونیست هستنند، یک پیرزن فقیر دائم ‌الخمر، رئیس بی‌انگیزه ی کارخانه ی در حال ورشکستگی تولید شلوار، و کارمندان و کارگرانی بدتر از او، زنی که به سبک بیمارگونه و مسخره ‌ای نظریات نوین روان‌شناسی را بلغور می‌کند، و در حقیقت به هجو می‌کشد، هات ‌داگ فروش متقلبی که برای ادای دین به سنت و تاریخ «نیواورلئان» لباس فرم دزد دریایی، بر فروشندگان خویش می‌پوشاند؛ این‌ها و شخصیت‌های دیگری از این دست، در ماجراهایی موازی کنار و دوشادوش قرار می‌گیرند و در نهایت همانند تکه‌ هایی از یک پازل، به هم می‌پیوندند، تا اتحادیه‌ ای از «ابلهان» را در جامعه ‌ای که نمونه ی عصر کنونی است، تشکیل دهند؛ آنها همچنین با کارها و حرف‌های بی‌معنی خویش، همانند دلقکها، بر باور «ایگنیشس»، قهرمان محوری رمان، که جهان امروز را سیرکی سیار می‌بیند، صحه میگذارندتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 27/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 08/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی",228,22
310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Lyn,"1,845",16300,4,"October 9, 2019","Confederacy of Dunces is a masterpiece of satire and irony, a worthy recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for best novel. It is funny, sometimes uproariously so, and I smiled and chuckled throughout. Toole’s depression and loss was not just of himself and his family, but also of us all, a genius who can create this comedic virtuosity might have written a folio of great work, and perhaps Confederacy was not even his greatest. Or perhaps, the spark that drove him to so bitingly observe our culture and time was also the flame from within that ate him away too, I guess we’ll never know. Ignatius J. Reilly is to literature as Homer Simpson is to our later culture, a grotesque more than a picaresque, a satirical slap in the face of who we are, a fool’s loving but damning foil to the king. The comparisons to Don Quixote are unavoidable, but whereas Quixote was roguish and loveable, Ignatius never achieves the heroic, even mock heroism. And he is never loveable. And perhaps that is a mark of Toole’s true, painful vision, that our idiosyncrasies need to be made fun of, but there is no gentleness left, that only a rough and stinging rebuke will show through the neon and carnival barkers. Maybe Ignatius was most timely amidst Toole’s own insanity, in the mid sixties, and by the time of Walker Percy’s “discovery” some of the edge had already worn away, or perhaps even, it was still just poking harmless fun at the products of society. Thirty years later, and the grotesque center stage with spotlights on Ignatius have become as common as reality TV shows, the characters no longer charicatures because of familiarity. So while Confederacy of Dunces is a modern classic, some of its stinging comment has been lost amidst too frequent of the same targets and too many opportunists to admonish gently. Thirty years later, Ignatius is no longer a caricature but a portrait.But to its credit, Dunces has some redemption, some easy to find, other examples more subtle. By the end, Mrs. Reilly can stand her own ground, while still being a mother who loves her son, Gus Levy has excorsied the demons from his past and seems able to meet future challenges head on. And the true hero of COD, Burma Jones, who, by a lucky stroke of PR savvy, will be a vagrant no more.Good book.** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. Ignatius is the memory and this portrait that Toole has given us is not just of this man, but he is a microcosm of a time and place, but in another sense, timeless.",174,14

310612,A Confederacy of Dunces,Sarah,734,144,4,"March 20, 2009","Dear Reader,Fortuna evidently was smiling upon my being when I endeavored to undertake the consumption of this philosophical masterpiece. How amusing to stumble upon a comic homage to Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, an homage that not only mirrors its source of inspiration in both content and structure, but moreover employs said source as a plot device of the most humorous kind. Certainly it was no mere accident; indeed it must have been a result of afflatus imparted by the goddess herself in collaboration with the muses Thalia and Calliope. Oh, what genius has the world lost with the tragic demise of John Kennedy Toole?Through his quixotic anti-hero, Ignatius J. Reilly, Toole is disposed to explore the ideas of predestination and game theory. Is Rielly a misunderstood genius, surrounded by intellectual inferiors and thus a victim of their nescience? Or is it his own distorted reality, paranoid delusions, and ineptitude that is the impetus of his misfortune? It is for you, dear reader, to decide.I found the descriptions of New Orleans particularly diverting. Such a cast of eccentric and delightful characters could only be found within the borders of the Crescent City (or Stars Hollow). Like Proust's madeleine, the wonderful references to NOLA summoned to my mind memories of a happier, pre-Katrina time in one of my favorite municipalities.I must say that the numerous references to various and sundry bodily emissions offended my delicate feminine sensibilities somewhat. Perhaps this was the plan of some devious alpha-male, to thus corrupt the otherwise sheltered and virginal innocence of my mentality. As Ignatius said, ""This subject deserves the attention of a profound thinker who has a certain perspective on the world's cultural development.""(If any perceptive film producers are interested in buying the movie rights to this Review, I might here make a note about the filming of this critique. A song performed by The Preservation Hall Jazz Band would provide excellent background accompaniment.

Hell, the cover illustration shows this to be grotesque humour. I put it down not to pick back up for more than a year at which point I decided to read up to page 75. What followed was not at all grotesque or surreal humor, but instead the funniest literary novel I've ever read. I LOVED IT. The 2016 Man Booker/Book Critics' Circle winner, The Sellout, is almost as funny at times. For my money though, no one holds a candle to Ignatius J. Reilly as the funniest character in a literary novel.It's hard to describe the novel or Ignatius with sufficient detail to justify/explain the hilarity. The author John Kennedy Toole, a tortured soul, was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize 12 years after his 1969 suicide at the age of 31. My best stab at a description of Ignatius is a brilliant bigoted buffoon in New Orleans (the Big Easy), and to give some quotes, though they are much funnier when read in context:
  Ignatius: “I suspect that beneath your offensively and vulgarly effeminate façade there may be a soul of sorts. Have you read widely in Boethius?""N.O. Denizen: ""Who? Oh, heavens no. I never even read newspapers.""Ignatius: ""Then you must begin a reading program immediately so that you may understand the crises of our age,"" Ignatius said solemnly. ""Begin with the late Romans, including Boethius, of course. Then you should dip rather extensively into early Medieval. You may skip the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. That is mostly dangerous propaganda. Now that I think of it, you had better skip the Romantics and the Victorians, too. For the contemporary period, you should study some selected comic books.""Denizen: ""You're fantastic.""Ignatius: ""I recommend Batman especially, for he tends to transcend the abysmal society in which he's found himself. His morality is rather rigid, also. I rather respect Batman.”
****
  Mother Reilly: “It smells terrible in here.'Ignatius: ""Well, what do you expect? The human body, when confined, produces certain odors which we tend to forget in this age of deodorants and other perversions. Actually, I find the atmosphere of this room rather comforting. Schiller needed the scent of apples rotting in his desk in order to write. I, too, have my needs. You may remember that Mark Twain preferred to lie supinely in bed while composing those rather dated and boring efforts which contemporary scholars try to prove meaningful. Veneration of Mark Twain is one of the roots of our current intellectual stalemate.”

Slapstick, not irony or sarcasm, is the method to capture the audience here. Had it been a short novel, I might have had patience for the silly main character, his mother complaining on the phone and all the rest, but to carry on for over 400 pages seriously annoyed me. I have not felt so bored when I was supposed to laugh since I was forced by my younger brothers to watch Dumb and Dumber and Wayne's World in the early nineties.Over 400 pages, and nothing to quote.

Reilly.However, when I realised that Toole was a slim, neat, tidy English teacher, quite unlike the obese Ignatius, I started to imagine Toole reading extracts from the book in class.Apparently, he was really popular with his students. I could just imagine the sense of privilege hearing him reading from ""Confederacy"".I can imagine the fits of laughter his students would have had as they heard some of the sentences and expressions emerge from his mouth.I like to imagine Toole alive and vital.Ignatius ReillyIgnatius is a resident of 1960's New Orleans, the fat kid in school who turns out to be a genius, but has no social graces.I don't recall him reading a book in the novel, but he is obviously well-read.He has constructed his own medieval world-view by which he judges everything and everybody around him.He sees himself as ""an avenging sword"" in a crusade on behalf of taste and decency, theology and geometry and the cultivation of a Rich Inner Life. He speaks in a wonderful, bookish formality that really confounds and pisses off everybody around him: ""Do you think that I am going to perambulate about in that sinkhole of vice?""When he combines it with a dose of sarcasm, it's hilarious.Astounding ArroganceIgnatius is intellectually arrogant, he judges others harshly, he is removed from reality.He is literally and metaphorically larger than life:""The grandeur of my physique, the complexity of my worldview, the decency and taste implicit in my carriage, the grace with which I function in the mire of today's world - all of these at once confuse and astound Clyde.""It's tempting to wonder whether Toole intended him to be an inept, but God-like genius, someone who came to the world in order to lead people to Heaven on Earth.There isn't an evil bone in his ample body.But he isn't virtuous as we would normally use the word.He's motivated by the greater good, only he hasn't factored people into the equation.When he ventures into reality for some purpose or other, it inevitably results in chaos and disorder, so there's a sense in which he's an agent of chaos.Ultimately, I think Ignatius isn't the Messiah, he's just a haughty, naughty boy.InfuencesMuch has been written about the influences on the novel.This is probably something better left to the individual reader, after you've read the book.Suffice it to say that I probably wasn't conscious of a lot of the influences, other than the obvious references to Boethius' ""The Consolations of Philosophy"".In one of his more benevolent moments, Ignatius says of ""Consolations"": ""The book teaches us to accept that which we cannot change. It describes the plight of a just man in an unjust society.""Ironically, Ignatius sets out to change just about everything in his life, whether consciously or subconsciously.He is not content with conformity: ""They would try to make me into a moron who liked television and new cars and frozen food.""Whatever the influences, ""Confederacy"" has an artistic integrity of its own.The Cloistered MindIgnatius starts off sloth-like (nowadays he would play games and drink copious amounts of Coke all day and all of the night): ""I was emulating the poet Milton by spending my youth in seclusion, meditation and study"".His college love interest, Myrna Minkoff, is awake up to the fact that he has closed his ""mind to both love and society"", a ""strange medieval mind in its cloister"".Up from the SlothIgnatius' mother embarrasses and coaxes him into getting a job, which is the beginning of his interaction with the wider world.""It is clearly time for me to step boldly into our society, not in the boring, passive manner of the Myrna Minkoff school of social action, but with great style and zest.""Structurally, on his journey, the novel loosely deals with the three taboos in polite society: sex, religion and politics (though not necessarily in that order).Ignatius ventures through this subject matter on the way to some sort of climax or revelation at the end of the book.The Importance of Being EarnestOn the way, Toole has lots of fun with his subject matter and influences.Ignatius strikes up an alliance with an openly gay character in their political battle: ""I suspect that beneath your offensively and vulgarly effeminate facade there may be a soul of sorts."" When his new soul mate hands him his business card, Ignatius ejaculates, ""Oh, my God, you can't really be named Dorian Greene.""Dorian responds, ""Yes, isn't that wild?""Together they set off to ""Save the World Through Degeneracy"".Ignatius is all the more attracted to this scheme, because he knows what effect it will have on Myrna: ""The scheme is too breathtaking for the literal, liberal minx mind mired in a claustrophobic clutch of cliches.""A Party in the City of ViceAs ""Confederacy"" works towards its climax, the action escalates.It starts at a fund-raising party in an apartment, then it goes into the streets of this home of the Mardi Gras, a Carnival-esque city of vice, and then finally to the strip joint, ""Night of Joy"".Failing to negotiate his way through the debauchery, Ignatius ends up ejected and dejected in the street, where he is almost run over by the reality of a city bus.Freudian SchlepsI don't want to make too much of this point, but I wondered whether the three main characters of ""Confederacy"" line up like this in terms of Freud's trichotomy:Ignatius: EgoMother: Super-EgoMyrna: Id.These three aspects of Ignatius' life and personality work their way to some sort of resolution at the end of the book.Whether Freud was a conscious influence or strategy, it is possible that Freud's trichotomy might just be a nice metaphor for the influences on our worldview. SPOILER ALERTSalvationAfter all of the fun and games, it's difficult to predict how Toole would end his farce.But ultimately he was a romantic at heart, and there is a happy ending.Myrna visits Ignatius with the intention of removing him from the City of Vice and the vice-like grip of his mother.Her solution is to take him to New York, where she has been living.You wonder whether this is just swapping one city of vice for another, but to them New York represents a city of light, possibly of like minds, a cosmopolitan alternative to the conservative southern backwater of New Orleans.The story ends as they head out on the road.But we know what is in store for Ignatius and Myrna in New York: love and society and, perhaps, just perhaps, lots of sex.Ignatius ends his journey with the most romantic thing he could say to reconcile with Myrna: ""To think that I fought your wisdom for years"".Toole's students would have had tears in their eyes.February 24, 2011",108,36
