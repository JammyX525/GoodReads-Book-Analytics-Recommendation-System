33456,A Dirty Job,Federico DN,232,495,3,"May 3, 2022","It's hard enough to be a parent that you also have to be Death incarnate.One day you are a parent trying hard to make things work, the next thing you know, you receive the big book of the dead and unwillingly become a taker of souls. Charlie Asher is a highly insecure owner of a modest second hand shop, has a little baby girl named Sophie, and now, he is a reluctant part time grim reaper. It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it. The big book clearly warns it: Don't screw it up! But when people accidentally start dropping dead all around him, Charlie knows things are going to go south fast. The deadly dark powers of the Underworld are rising, and soon, no citizen in the city will be safe. Not his close ones, not Sophie, and certainly not him. An entertaining humorous novel, not great, but fairly enjoyable. Felt like a mixture of the 'Dead like me' tv series with the absurd 'Hitchhikers' humor, but without the sci-fi. A noticeable abundance of dark humor and nasty jokes. Not really suited for the easily offended. Charlie Asher is one funny goofy character, and I could certainly identify with his beta male personality :p. -----------------------------------------------Es suficientemente difícil ser padre, que también tenés que ser la Muerte encarnada.Un día sos un padre tratando mucho de hacer funcionar las cosas, y lo próximo que pasa, recibís el gran libro de muerte y te convertis involuntariamente en un tomador de almas. Charlie Asher es un altamente inseguro dueño de una modesta tienda de segunda mano, tiene una pequeña hija llamada Sophie, y ahora, es renuentemente la parca a tiempo medio. Es un trabajo sucio, pero alguien tiene que hacerlo. El gran libro claramente lo advierte: No lo arruines! Pero cuando la gente accidentalmente empieza a caer muerta todo alrededor suyo, Charlie sabe que las cosas se van a ir rápidamente al traste. Los mortales oscuros poderes del inframundo se levantan, y pronto, ningún ciudadano estará a salvo. No sus nás cercanos, no Sophie, y ciertamente, no él!Una entretenida novela humorística, no excelente, pero bastante disfrutable. Se sintió como una mezcla de la serie 'Dead like me' y el absurdo humor de 'Hitchhikers', pero sin el componente sci-fi. Una notable abundancia de humor negro y chistes sexuales. No realmente apropiado para el que se ofende fácilmente. Charlie Asher es un gracioso y ridículo personaje, pero ciertamente pude identificarme con su personalidad de tipo beta :p.",262,16
33456,A Dirty Job,Will Byrnes,"1,284",11900,4,"October 27, 2022"," Christopher Moore - image from the Portland Mercury Charlie Asher is a pretty regular guy having a regular life, until he sees death hovering over his wife following the birth of their first child. Strange things begin to happen and it takes a while before Charlie learns that he has been selected as a Death Merchant, a collector of the souls of those nearly or recently deceased. The job comes with a rulebook which, like most instructional manuals is of limited value. It gets even weirder when he learns that his baby girl has a bit of power all her own. Moore’s cast of quirky characters includes dueling babysitters, middle aged ladies from China and Russia, a goth 16-year-old assistant and an ex-cop who works for him in his second hand shop. His lesbian sister is quite sympathetic even if she does keep stealing suits from his closet. And oh, yeah, he is pursued by creatures from below, sewer-harpies who long to return to the land above for a little bloodletting, with Charlie and his baby topping their menus. This is literally laugh-out-loud funny. He goes a bit too dark I thought in describing details of the harpies’ endeavors, but this is a wonderful, fun read.

33456,A Dirty Job,Mario the lone bookwolf,732,3387,4,"October 17, 2021","As if upbringing wasn´t hard enough, a metaphysical, forced second job doesn´t really make it any easier.It would be interesting to know where Pratchett took his inspiration for DEATH and if Moore was inspired by him, very probably, or by some other author who thought that personifying death or making him a franchise seeking, overworked dealer of doom, wouldn´t be sweet.But the real kicker of this thing is the fact that his daughter has some power too, as if it wasn´t obvious after seeing the cover, maybe I am a bit overprotective helicopter parenting here regarding protecting you from spoilers.  which opens up the room for the real hilarity, quicker cuts, and more dynamic plot development. It´s enjoyable how the cast of weird sidekicks and secondary characters react to the new development, indirectly making fun of stereotypes about these groups, upbringing, and, I am not sure about this, babies and infants? Ok, they are of course ridiculous too, these huge heads, clumsy, kind of, meh, let´s be honest, totally useless and unproductive, a socioeconomically dead period of life. The thing that is missing in Moore´s work, except his work Lamb, while it´s a substantial element of Ruffs´, Pratchett´s, Robbins´, Boyle´s, although he isn´t really funny but depressing, etc. creations, is the meta, social criticism level. Slapstick, weird characters, hilarious dialogues, the one or other critical innuendo, but not more than that. That´s especially strange because, as mentioned, Lamb is one of the most amazing clerical criticisms of all time, making fun of faith in a way that´s amazing, being entertaining and educating, not too extremely blasphemous, but definitively not tame too. For any reason, Moore preferred to position himself as a more easygoing, trivial, 2dimensional comedy writer, instead of expanding towards the full 3D, full in your face satire. Even stranger, subjectively it must be much harder to write funny dialogues and situations in contrast to just adding some indirect, boring, social criticism in some dialogues or expositional actions. But possibly I am misunderstanding something and the reason is that it´s much harder to construct full frontal, sophisticated satire that has much fewer options than haha he fell and died humor, so I maybe kind of self explained it. On the other hand, again, Lamb was his greatest hit, so maybe it´s more a question of time effort, producing 2 to 3 good works instead of one great, because it showed that he knew and was able to combine lowbrow and highbrow satire to a masterpiece. However, in the not so big comedy writing universe, Moore is a relatively stable star without much danger of unexpected, rhetoric protuberances that gamma ray burst away lifetime wasted with unfunny satire, having 3 to 5 very good and some good reads, what a wordplay thank me later for free promotion social cataloging network, easygoing and quick for in between, perfect between the more heavy, dark comedy stuff that´s waiting out there too if you are in the lucky position of not having explored this genre.

33456,A Dirty Job,Jeff ,912,674,4,"February 11, 2015","Three and a half stars.If you threw Carl Hiaasen and Stephen King’s brains into a blender and pureed them with nutmeg and cinnamon, drank it like a protein shake and decided to take up writing, your resulting book might be this. You have death merchants, hounds from hell, grotesque monsters living in the San Francisco sewers and impending doom. For Hiaasen you have a huge dollop of quirkiness. Every character is quirky. Hand me a handy wipe, for I have quirk all over my shirt.Charlie Asher is a beta male (there’s a funny addendum/quiz at the back of the book that lets you test to see whether you’re a beta male), which puts him slightly above average in the human pecking order. Charlie has also been appointed to be a death merchant. That means his job is to find the souls of dead people. They’re encased in a variety of objects, which glow red. Poor Charlie also needs to run his business, grieve for his late wife, take care of his newborn daughter, battle monsters and deal with lots of quirky people.This is a funny book, with a few memorable characters (sarcastic Goth girl Lily and a seven-foot black man who dresses in a green suit and goes by the name of Minty Fresh, to name a few – yeah, quirky); however, if it was half the length and had half the quirk, I’d have liked it even more.",137,39
33456,A Dirty Job,ttrygve,37,12,5,"September 23, 2008","Go read this book. Now. It's hilarious, you will not regret it. That is all the review it requires. =)",119,5
33456,A Dirty Job,Todd,102,17,2,"October 26, 2007","It seems to me that Moore wants to be a cross between Stephen King and Dave Barry, and for the first half of this book, he nearly succeeds. But once he reaches the midway point, he falls into the trap of trying to squeeze in every one-liner he can -- the result is that all of his characters end up speaking in the same, snarky voice, and no one really seems to be anything other than a generic, stock character. This tends to be a consistent problem in all of his books I've read to date - he seems to value his own cleverness as far as crafting one-off jokes rather than trusting that humor will naturally arise from well crafted situations and characters. As comedic novels go, in this case Moore has taken a brilliant premise, then crafted a second or third-rate sitcom around it. In short, it feels like a first draft rather than a completed novel.However, his books do continue to grow in popularity (which should be no surprise to me given that ""Two and a Half Men"" is consistently in the Nielsen top 10). And I keep reading his work because there is always a lot of promise in the basic concepts. Next time, I hope he has a strong editor that will send him back to tighten up his plotlines and more clearly define his characters so that his next novel will live up to the description on the book jacket.Even more ""meh"".",106,15
33456,A Dirty Job,Anne,"3,785",6900,3,"January 1, 2023","The Grim Rreaper?Charlie Asher (Beta Male) suddenly finds himself widowed after the birth of his daughter, Sophie. He also finds himself the newest recruit of Death. No, he is not The Death, he is simply to collect the souls of the recently departed and store them until they are ready to be placed with a new body. He is a Death Merchant, or at least that is the name coined by Mr. Fresh, the record store owner who collected his wife's soul.As if all of this wasn't enough, poor Charlie has to figure out how to keep his little girl from pointing at people and saying, kitty, as they seem to drop dead after she does it. There is also the issue of the Hellhounds. Yes, he is grateful Sophie has some pets that can finally survive her special talent, but they are a little hard to explain to the neighbors.Death is a hard subject to wrap your mind around, much less find humorous, but somehow Moore does it. He manages to make it touching and funny at the same time. Very cute story.I will say that upon relistening to this 14 years later, all that beta male stuff was just dorky. Not sure if it just didn't age well as a joke, or if I just didn't notice how stupid it was the first time around. It's still a mostly fun book, though, and I plan on reading the sequel at some point.",95,2
33456,A Dirty Job,Rebecca,254,8,1,"December 4, 2013","I wanted to read Moore's book Lamb, but it was checked out so I picked up A Dirty Job instead. It maybe was a bad sample of his work, but as luck would have it, it's what I read, wanting to stop in several places, but hoping it would redeem itself. No such luck. The book was hard to follow timewise-- basically you don't know if action is taking place over a week or 6 years. The characters are flat and annoying, and the dialogue is the same. The book is also misogynistic and racist at points, which I'm sure the author saw as ""gentle teasing"" but in actuality was quite disgusting. In the end, my interest in reading any of Christopher Moore's other books has been permanently put to rest.",84,7
33456,A Dirty Job,Shan,24,8,5,"June 27, 2008","Let me preface this by saying I LOVE Christopher Moore. L-O-V-E. If he wrote a grocery list, I'd read it rapturously. This book (along with Lamb, which I will also review shortly) is one of my absolute favorites of his. ""A Dirty Job"" may be his funniest, wittiest book yet (although ""Lamb"" is pretty close....). This book has the average Beta male, Charlie Asher, his dead wife, their newborn daughter, little old Asian and Russian babysitters, a jailbait goth girl store clerk, expensive suits, hellhounds, Death Merchants, Three Fingered Hu (the drycleaner and his granddaughter Cindy Lou Hu...get it???), squirrels in tutus, Filipino she-male dating sites, and a seven foot tall black record store owner driving a Cadillac Eldorado and dressed in green suits whose name is Minty Fresh, AND it is dedicated to hospice workers and the important work they do. How could you not love it?? Moore has a smart, comical way of writing that just tickles my brain in that oh so delicious way that makes me just love language even more, and this book does not disappoint. His surreal, absurdist humor is sublime. However, he tempers that humour with a compassion,a humanness, an ability to make one look at universal truths and the human condition (in this book's case, death, dying, love, how we deal with our fears and the death of those we love, different tenents of world religions, destiny, the epic battle of good vs. evil, etc). When one looks past the comedy, one can see so much more in his novels. His writing is irreverent, wickedly fun, engaging, thoughtful and leaves you smiling, satisfied, giggling (and groaning) and full of all sorts of metaphysical thoughts. Moore thoroughly draws you into his unique world and completely engages you. And this book is set in San Francisco and is full of lovely little descriptions and anecdotes about the city (which had me snickering and nodding as I love SF, but even if you don't know the city, it will make you feel like you'd like to). I'm one of those people who, when I read a book I enjoy this much, love to jot down the poignant, funny, smart lines that really struck me or made me say ""now THIS is writing""; with this book, it was just too big a task. There are delightful one-liners peppered throughout, beautiful passages, and dialogue that has me snickering every other page. All in all, this book vies for the title My Favorite Moore Book, and definitely for one of the funniest books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. Try it: you'll giggle, you'll sigh, you'll think. Trust me. Like Bear. *giggle, snort*",65,3
33456,A Dirty Job,Jess the Shelf-Declared Bibliophile,"2,020",575,4,"June 22, 2021","I loved this way more than I even expected to, to be honest! The author has a great imagination and a fantastic sense of humor that rolled together and created a morbidly hilarious masterpiece. Can’t wait to find out what happens in the second book!",61,N/A
33456,A Dirty Job,Lyn,"1,845",16300,4,"March 1, 2016","I am a big fan of Moore, he is witty, kooky, has a penchant for the occult and tells a good story. Way back in HS I read Piers Anthony's On a Pale Horse, and this is a satirical, humorous variation on that theme. Moore is stringing together elements of his other novels and has recurring characters, all the more fun.A Dirty Job deals with the tale of Charlie Asher, the owner of an antique store in San Francisco who is a “beta male” as opposed to an alpha and he is raising his daughter alone following his wife’s death. Charlie is a “death merchant” meaning that he finds, collects and protects souls from the forces of the underworld. Moore includes elements of the strange and bizarre, mythological and fantastic characters (like the Irish Morrigan) and also Orcus of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons fame (and Roman and Etruscan myth).One of Moore’s better books, it is told with humor and warmth and would be a good introduction to his work. A fan of Neil Gaiman's American Gods and Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid series would also like this.",56,N/A
33456,A Dirty Job,Amanda,282,315,4,"September 10, 2016","After the birth of his daughter, Charlie Asher, mild-mannered Beta Male, finds his life upended--and not just because he's become a new father. Through a strange course of events, he finds that he has been selected to be a Death Merchant, harvesting the souls of the dead and helping them on their journey to transcendence. The job, unfortunately, comes with a shit-ton of problems, such as being suspected of murder; hellhounds unexpectedly manifesting in his home; sewer harpies taunting him at every turn; encounters with an army of small, nattily dressed chimera; the perpetual threat of the Forces of Darkness rising if he fails; and the disconcerting knowledge that his daughter can kill by simply pointing and uttering that most powerful and fear inducing of words: ""kitty."" Plus, ""Hi, I'm Death. With the big 'D'"" doesn't really work as a pick-up line with the ladies. He's got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one. His guide to his new lifestyle is The Great Big Book of Death, which really isn't that big. Or informative. Really it's just a lot of cartoonish pictures with such helpful tips as ""In order to hold off the Forces of Darkness, you will need a number two pencil and a calendar."" Death shops at Staples. Sucks to be Charlie.There are a lot of words that I could throw around about Moore's writing: zany, wacky, demented, hilarious. But let's go ahead and toss ""poignant"" on the list. Trust me, everything you expect from a Moore novel is here, but one of the things I admire about his stories is that, for all the strangeness getting stranger, there's a well-spring of compassion and respect for humanity in his work that can surface when you least expect it. It should be no surprise that people die in a book about death, but what may catch many off guard is the genuine respect Moore demonstrates for the passing of a human life and a keen understanding that ""Most of us don't live our lives with one, integrated self that meets the world, we're a whole bunch of selves. When someone dies, they all integrate into the soul--the essence of who we are, beyond the different faces we wear throughout our lives."" Moments like this are what elevate Moore's work above pure screwball comedic writing. He has a keen understanding that life is absurdity and that humor is the best coping mechanism we have.Cross posted at This Insignificant Cinder",47,6
33456,A Dirty Job,F,294,246,3,"July 11, 2017","Such an odd story. The only bit I did not like was the very imaginative ending. I just can't deal with monsters and evil crow women or 50+ creatures made out of mixed animal parts. The characters were brillant. Funny situations and funny conversations. Loved the Russian and Chinese woman that looked after Sophie all the time ""strong like bear""My favourite quote from the book has to be "" Mrs Ling covered Sophie's eyes to shield her from the abomination her fathers' unwillingly journey into beastiliaty.",41,1 comment
33456,A Dirty Job,☠Kayla☠,203,71,5,"April 27, 2020","This book was hilarious! So many times I had to stop reading because I was laughing to hard. The humor is a bit darker and more adult though, fair warning.The easiest way to even explain this book is simply that the main character, Charlie Asher, is a Beta Male. He overthinks things and wouldn't involve himself if he didn't have to, which is really hard to do now since he's been recruited to be Death. Which is really a complication for him now that he also has a newborn baby girl named Sophie that he has to look after. Every time I read this book I was just expecting to have a good laugh. Christopher Moore is one hell of an author and I can't wait to pick up more of his books!I really don't know what else to say about this book other than I loved it and it was hilarious!",36,1 comment
33456,A Dirty Job,Chris,341,950,4,"February 9, 2008","What is that, you might ask? Well, in Moore's words:""When Alpha Males set out to conquer neighboring tribes, to count coups and take heads, Beta Males could see in advance that in the event of victory, the influx of female slaves was going to leave a surplus of mateless women cast out for younger trophy models, with nothing to do but salt down the heads and file the uncounted coups, and some would find solace in the arms of any Beta Male smart enough to survive.... The world is led by Alpha Males, but the machinery of the world turns on the bearings of the Beta Male....When Charlie finds himself a widower with an infant daughter, his Beta Male imagination can't find any way to cope. Until he finds that he's been chosen for a new avocation - a Merchant of Death. His job is to collect souls, bound to objects owned by the dying, and to make sure they get into the right hands. People come to his shop, Asher's Secondhand, and buy what they need. And occasionally, they need a soul.For such a funny book, Moore has put a really interesting metaphysical idea in this book. That idea is kind of creepy - not everybody has a soul. At least, not all the time. Souls need to learn and develop. Unfortunately, one person's life is not always enough time in which to learn those important lessons. So when the body dies, the soul moves on. But not necessarily into another person. Sometimes it might go into an object - a CD, a pair of sneakers, an umbrella - to await their next body. Charlie Asher's job - his and the other Merchants of Death - is to make sure those souls are kept safe until their next owners come by to collect them.Of course, it's never quite that easy. While being a Merchant of Death certainly helps Charlie in the years following his wife's death, there are Dark Forces out there who want those souls. With human souls, the Dark Forces will become stronger, strong enough to decide who will be the Luminatus - the new, true Death.This book packs a lot into nearly 400 pages. There's the humor, of course, the absurdist fantasy humor that Christopher Moore does so very well. But there's also the philosophy of souls that I hadn't come across before, and - most central to the book - a good hard look at death.This book is dedicated in part to hospice workers, the people who volunteer to help people out of this life and into the next, the people who have the strength to deal with one of the most frightening aspects of human existence. While Moore's presentation of death and dying certainly isn't pretty, or necessarily reassuring, it isn't scary. It's purposeful and important and, more importantly, bigger than the person who is doing the dying. From time to time, we all need to look at this inevitability and resolve to meet it with the same dignity and reverence that we would meet any other great moment in our lives. For a guy who makes a living writing funny fantasy/horror, Moore has done a very nice job at making his point.Oh, and I mentioned before the subject of his endings, how they usually seem to be kind of forced and too fast. This is better than his earlier works, although you do kind of see the ending coming from really far away. Not a bad thing, necessarily, but perhaps a bit like death itself - you know what the ending will be, but you try to make yourself forget so that it'll be a surprise when you get there.... Or something.",34,1 comment
