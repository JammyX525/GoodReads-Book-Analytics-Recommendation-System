9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,erin,9,20,1,"January 31, 2007","It's been a busy couple of weeks, so I thought I'd spent the last of my holiday indulging in a witty travelogue to set my feet itching. Unfortunately, I picked the wrong book. Years of declining the advice of the Bryson-worshipers, it seems, was not in vain.I'm halfway through, and - like the author on the daunting trail - am unsure as to whether or not I can finish my task. Bryson sounds, to put it mildly, a real jerk. He's smug and superior, and spends most of the book complaining about his companions on the trail. A common motif is how everyone one is but a weekend hiker, that he is a true back-to-nature type in comparison. True, some of his encounters sound less than thrilling, but even the obnoxious woman he encounters should get credit for tackling the trail by herself. Instead, she's unceremoniously ditched (in real life as well as print) by the man who couldn't stomach the thought of going alone. He enlists the companionship of a long-lost friend with whom he'd proven incompatible on a previous travel experience. Said ""friend"" is then derided throughout the book for his sloth, roughness in manner, and lowbrow tastes. Meanwhile, Bryson paints himself as Guardian of the Trail, criticising the Parks Service along with all who venture through her woods.I'm still waiting for even a glimpse of the much-vaunted Bryson wit and charm to show itself. At the moment, he's nothing more than the stereotypical Blue Stater - putting himself on a pedestal while looking down his nose at everyone else. It's not attractive, and it makes for a very frustrating read. I wish he'd stayed home.",534,152
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Sud666,"1,895",156,3,"November 24, 2020","I am a huge fan of hiking. My friends and I, several times a year, will take trips out to random State and National Parks. We spend a great deal of time out in the woods and any sort of nature. It is not only enjoyable and relaxing but good to stay in shape. But then again my friends and I are all people who are very comfortable n the woods, due to our military backgrounds.Then there are these two. *sigh* Is the book funny? Yes...that humor and the interesting history about the Appalachian Trail is the only reason I finished this book. Why? To hear two fat fools tromping through the Appalachians is borderline annoying. Seriously? Are civilians usually so fucking stupid? (Don't answer that. It's rhetorical. I've been watching civilians since 2008 and I already know the answer). This is a laundry list of what NOT to do, what NOT to eat and what NOT to drink. I was aghast at the stuff these two were munching on and the amount of soda pop they drink. Stupid assholes don't realize soda dehydrates you...but hey, it's more common than you think. As an example of real life stupidity, there is an awesome State Park in Utah called Great Salt Lake park. It's ummmm a salt lake...which means it's a rather extreme environment. Now a quick Google search will show you DOZENS on incidents of idiots wandering around this place with little to no hydration and getting in trouble or even dying. Does this surprise you? Then you have a much higher level of respect for the survivability of the average civilian. It doesn't surprise me in the slightest and books like this merely reinforce what an instructor of mine at Scout-Sniper school said ""Don't ever mistake it-but civilian types have a field survivability rate comparable to infants""So please, don't do any of the things in this book. If you wish to hike the Appalachian Trail..ask yourself: How often do you walk? Have you ever just put on steel toed boots, stuffed a backpack with say 45-60 lbs of books and then went on a nice 5 or six mile hike? Go for it. Do it on flat ground. If at the end of it..you have barely a sheen of sweat and are like ""ok what's next?"" then you are fine. However if this sounds ""rough"" ummmmmmm...yeah..take a car, stay at hotels and realize watching Animal Planet or National Geographic has not prepared your body for real nature with no one nearby to come save you.Now that my polemic is over- funny book. Nothing great. Some decent history about the trail...and that's really it. I didn't care for the two fat asses. I read this book because I enjoy nature and spend a lot of time in it. But there was no need for me to really read this book...you may enjoy it as a funny travelogue, but that's all it is.",269,"4,178"
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Jason,137,2263,3,"January 29, 2015","I am what some might call a pussy hiker. I do genuinely enjoy a leisurely stroll in the “mountains” of Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire. I like the pretty views. I always bring my conveniently-sized L.L. Bean backpack ($39.95 from the Kittery Outlets) so I have a place for my camera and cell phone. But by early afternoon, I would like to be done, please. I would like to be done and sitting at a booth in a pub with my burger and beer. Camping is certainly worthy of consideration, but here’s the deal: I don’t do rain. In light of the fact that weather reports are unreliable beyond a 48-hour window (and even that is pushing it in New England), it is unlikely I would ever camp for more than a two-night stay. Oh, and if I were to camp, I would like it to be at a site that has free Wi-Fi.What this amounts to is that the Appalachian Trail, endearingly referred to by those hiking it as “the AT,” will never be anything more to me than a lovely little map.
(click to enlarge)
BUT. I am glad for gung-ho people like Bryson and his chubby checker friend Katz who did walk “the AT” and are kind enough to let me know what I am missing. As it turns out, I am not missing much. This is not to downplay the extraordinarity of a 2,200-mile trail of wilderness running from Georgia to Maine, a trail that takes the average thru-hiker six months to complete, but in terms of day-to-day variation, it is basically a shitload of trees followed by another shitload of trees.
  
For me, this book makes a better argument for the day hike. There are many parts of the trail I would enjoy, including the Smoky Mountains, the Shenandoah Valley, and the Delaware Water Gap. Like Bryson, though, I am a people person, and I enjoy my simple human comforts. I would like to see these areas without having to make an extended departure from civilization. Why can’t I have both—my nature and my nurture? Fortunately for me, almost a full third of the Appalachian Trail is in New England, so maybe I can have it all—because I think if there is one thing I’ve learned from Bryson’s experience, it is that I don’t have to suffer through long days of cold rain and hungry nights to enjoy what the Appalachian Trail has to offer.",252,76
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Anne,"3,785",6900,4,"June 25, 2021","I kind of surprised I liked this book at all, because: a) I read pathetically little non-fiction b) I've never read a travelogue ANDc) I'm only a fan of the Great Outdoors as long as I'm safely Indoors.So, color me shocked that I not only finished this, but giggled my way through quite a bit of it! Bryson really is a pretty funny writer, and the way he captured his experience on the Appalachian Trail had me in tears a few times. His fears about getting mauled by a bear (among other things) before he started off were especially hysterical, and maybe that's because I could see a lot of myself in his initial terror of spending so much time surrounded by...NATURE!Now, there was a decent-sized chunk towards the middle of the book that I just had to grit my teeth and push on through. Bryson's friend Katz wasn't with him during this portion, and the difference in the tone of the writing is really noticeable. Lots and lots and lots of mind-numbing details about the Trail, and very little of his experiences. And while all of that sort of info is relevant to the book, it's also the main reason that I don't actively seek out non-fiction or travelogues. Eventually, Katz comes back to finish out the hike, and the story vastly improves, but it never managed to recapture the humor or spirit that it had in the beginning. But that's only MY opinion.And I really did enjoy the last bits of the book a lot. Especially the moments between Katz & Bryson there towards the end.Overall, I'd say this was a winner. And even if the whole thing wasn't to my liking, the first half was an easy 5 star read for me.In fact, it made me want to call up my BFF to see if she wanted to take the kids camping this summer so we could poop near a waterfall!You know, instead of meeting at a hotel on the beach and drinking ourselves silly while the kids play in the surf.And then I thought about that sentence.Bwahahahahahahaha!No. Just...no.See you in Florida, Jill! I'll bring the blender! ",237,116
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,J.L.   Sutton,651,824,2,"May 2, 2016","I wanted to like Bill Bryson’s A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail. Not sure what I was expecting from this—perhaps more about hiking on the actual AT and the reasons Bryson made this trek—but I was mostly disappointed. It read like a series of travel brochures: here’s the history of the region on this section of the trail, and now another…There was much more attention devoted to towns along the route than hiking the actual trail. It was also disappointing that Bryson noted the historical stereotypes of Appalachian people and casually confirmed their stupidity without any real interaction (not once but many times). The smugness of his remarks was irritating. I still would like to hike the AT, but Bryson did little to illuminate what it’s really like to hike the trail except to offer that it’s not what most people expect. ",184,13
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Julie G ,857,2628,4,"April 21, 2019","I'm no city mouse. I'm a country mouse who lives in jeans and who often has a thick layer of soil under her nails from gardening. But, when compared to my brother, I feel like Beyoncé.My brother is like. . . Inman, from Cold Mountain. A man who walks and walks, all over Appalachia.He knows how to forage for food and how to identify what is good and what is bad, out in nature. I can point to anything within the plant kingdom, and he knows its name. He composts all of his own waste and leaves a very faint footprint on our planet.He's also. . . you know, a little crazy, when it comes to the whole walking thing.My brother has thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail once, in its entirety, and has section-hiked more than 900+ miles of favorite parts of it, at other times. He walks or hikes 5-25 miles a day, and he's currently on the Pacific Crest Trail, somewhere in Northern California, at the time of this writing.He's a walker, and even though I ALSO walk and hike, my habits apparently look like small potatoes to him. When he was here in May, at our house, preparing to head out to hike the PCT, he was nudging me, emphatically, to hike the Appalachian Trail soon.He was doing this nudging as all three of my kids were in the kitchen with me, and one of them was literally hanging on to my leg. Both dogs were starving, staring at me as we talked, our cats were walking in and out of the house, yowling for food, and my husband was outside, pulling weeds.I must have looked at him like he was an idiot. I sputtered out something in annoyance, like, “I have responsibilities. Maybe someday, like, when we're retired??” (And, maybe not then, either?)The compromise we reached was that, instead of starting the AT on that day, I would commit to reading Bill Bryson's A Walk in the Woods while he was out on the PCT. Fair enough. I finished it today.Here's what I have to say:I love Bill Bryson when he's funny, like when he's making social observations, or, in the case of this story, out hiking with his friend, Stephen Katz, and the hilarious commentary that ensues.I don't love Bill Bryson when he bores me to bits, breaking off from the funny story to describe geological phenomenons or maps or the National Park system in the United States. Be humorous OR be didactic, Bill, but please don't be both. I would never hike one of these trails without an entourage, bear spray, a billy club and/or a baseball bat and an INCREDIBLE SENSE OF HUMOR.After reading Bryson's book, I would like to hike at least part of the Appalachian Trail someday, if only to write about it. I believe that my desire to pepper spray any strange looking man on the trail, without a moment's hesitation, may make for some interesting writing. Plus, I'd be sure to scream at every snake, and I'd probably be stupid enough to play with a bear cub. They're so cute!Personally, I wanted to know a LOT more about these freaks in the shelter at night, and way more details on where and how they all went to the bathroom (shudder), and I felt completely let-down that Bryson and his companion hiked so little of the actual trail.Honestly, the book was so boring in the middle (when they gave up on the trail the first time), that I could barely summon the interest to read it again.I think I need to stop thinking of Bryson as a humorist, like Dave Barry. He does make me laugh, but he does drone on, too, about things that interest me not. I've reached a weird point with him, where I'm not sure I want to continue reading more.Four stars for some memorable descriptions of a few of the hikers and several hearty laughs. . . And fingers crossed for the safe return home of my brother!",175,86
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Diane,"1,079",2605,5,"May 12, 2017","Bill Bryson calls the Appalachian Trail ""the grandaddy of long hikes,"" but for me, this book is the granddaddy of hiking memoirs. I first read it sometime around 1999, and I enjoyed it so much that not only have I reread this multiple times, but it also inspired me to read at least a dozen other hiking adventures. None have matched Bryson's wit. Before he started writing long books on various aspects of history, Bryson was known for his entertaining travelogues. A Walk in the Woods was his humorous take on attempting a long-distance hike of the Appalachian Trail, which spans more than 2,100 miles from Georgia to Maine. Here were his reasons for trying:""It would get me fit after years of waddlesome sloth. It would be an interesting and reflective way to reacquaint myself with the scale and beauty of my native land after nearly twenty years of living abroad. It would be useful (I wasn't quite sure in what way, but I was sure nonetheless) to learn to fend for myself in the wilderness. When guys in camouflage pants and hunting hats sat around in the Four Aces Diner talking about fearsome things done out-of-doors, I would no longer have to feel like such a cupcake. I wanted a little of that swagger that comes with being able to gaze at a far horizon through eyes of chipped granite and say with a slow, manly sniff, 'Yeah, I've shit in the woods.'""And so Bryson plans his trip, gets indignant over the high cost of outdoor equipment, and recruits an old friend, Stephen Katz, to walk the trail with him. Katz, an overweight, out-of-shape, recovering alcoholic, adds much hilarity to the adventure. The first day on the trail, Katz falls behind and has a fit, throwing away a lot of supplies in an effort to lighten the load of his pack. Later he gets lost during a stretch when they were dangerously low on water. But he's so pathetic and funny that you forgive him.Meanwhile, Bryson was having his own problems that first day:""It was hell. First days on hiking trips always are. I was hopelessly out of shape -- hopelessly. The pack weighed way too much. Way too much. I had never encountered anything so hard, for which I was so ill prepared. Every step was a struggle. The hardest part was coming to terms with the constant dispiriting discovery that there is always more hill ... The elusive summit continually retreats by whatever distance you press forward, so that each time the canopy parts enough to give a view you are dismayed to see that the topmost trees are as remote, as unattainable, as before. Still you stagger on. What else can you do?""After a few days on the trail, they met another hiker named Mary Ellen, who leeched onto them. ""She was from Florida, and she was, as Katz forever after termed her in a special tone of awe, a piece of work. She talked nonstop, except when she was clearing out her eustachian tubes (which she did frequently) by pinching her nose and blowing out with a series of violent and alarming snorts of a sort that would make a dog leave the sofa and get under a table in the next room. I have long known that it is part of God's plan for me to spend a little time with each of the most stupid people on earth, and Mary Ellen was proof that even in the Appalachian woods I would not be spared.""I'm not going to retype entire pages, but trust me that the conversations with Mary Ellen are one of the highlights of this book. Bryson and Katz spend several weeks on the trail, hiking 500 miles in their first section. Then the two take a break and return home for a few weeks, and Bryson resumes with some shorter hikes in New England. Katz and Bryson reunite in Maine to hike a particularly daunting section of the trail called the Hundred Mile Wilderness:""The Appalachian Trail is the hardest thing I have ever done, and the Maine portion was the hardest part of the Appalachian Trail, and by a factor I couldn't begin to compute.""Exhausted, filthy and hungry, the two abandon their trek in Maine and hitchhike to a small town, where they're able to make their way home again. ""I have regrets, of course. I regret that I didn't do [Mount] Katahdin (though I will, I promise you, I will). I regret that I never saw a bear or wolf or followed the padding retreat of a giant hellbender salamander, never shooed away a bobcat or sidestepped a rattlesnake, never flushed a startled boar. I wish that just once I had truly stared death in the face (briefly, with a written assurance of survival). But I got a great deal else from the experience. I learned to pitch a tent and sleep beneath the stars. For a brief, proud period I was slender and fit. I gained a profound respect for wilderness and nature and the benign dark power of woods. I understand now, in a way I never did before, the colossal scale of the world. I found patience and fortitude that I didn't know I had. I had discovered an America that millions of people scarcely know exists ... Best of all, these days when I see a mountain, I look at it slowly and appraisingly, with a narrow, confident gaze and eyes of chipped granite.""One of the things I especially like about this book is the history that Bryson includes along the way. He shares interesting stories about the areas he's passing through and about how the trail was built. He also looks at America's unique relationship with nature, which includes some backwards policies of the U.S. Forest Service and the Parks Service. It's really a delight to read.This memoir has been criticized because Bryson doesn't hike the entire trail, but regardless of the distance, it's still a damn fine travelogue. This was his experience on the AT, which he shares with much humor and insight. I don't care that he hiked only 870 miles out of 2,100 -- the point was that he attempted it.",131,30
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Ben,40,4,1,"June 18, 2011","Bill Bryson is extremely annoying. I started out liking this book, but the further I went along, the more obnoxious I found the author's smarter-than-thou attitude. And that's a shame, too, because I was very interested in the subject matter and had the impression that Bryson wrote with a comedic edge. However, his sense of humor turns out to be quite bland, and consists mostly of making fun of everyone he meets. Get ready for adjectives like ""stupid"" and ""fat"" ... very high-brow. And don't worry, you'll hear the standard inbred jokes as he hikes through the South.Like hypocritical rants? You'll get plenty here; he eviscerates the National Park system, but that doesn't stop him from taking full advantage of all its amenities. He rips tourists who just stop by the AT to do quick hikes, eat cheeseburgers at fast-food restaurants, then hop in their cars and move on, and yet he spends much of the middle section of the book doing just that! He also rips unprepared hikers who don't know what they're doing ... much like the time later in the book when he leaves his windbreaker at home while hiking in the Presidentials; also, he sets out to hike the entire length of the AT, but gives up when he looks at a map in Gatlinburg and realizes -gasp- the AT is really long! Seriously? You didn't look at a map BEFORE you started hiking? Needless to say, he gave up immediately.Not that there's anything wrong with giving up. I guess this writer's just not for me - he comes across as having a little more disdain for the rest of the world than he has a right to.",115,10

9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,W,"1,185",4,5,"February 15, 2021","Travel writing does not get any better or any funnier than this. This is Bill Bryson at his very best,side splittingly funny.Bill Bryson sets out with his friend Katz to hike the Appalachian trail. The trail is picturesque,but for two men in their forties,it is still hard work.As he always does,Bryson digs up a whole lot of background detail and trivia about the trail. It's first rate entertainment. Katz may not be the ideal hiking companion but provides plenty of humour.There are lively encounters with fellow hikers along the way and even some disconcerting ones with wildlife. The trail can be dangerous too,as shown by the murder of some hikers in the past.It is a lot of hard work,sleeping rough in shelters and braving the elements.Eventually,Bryson has to concede that he will not be able to walk the entire trail.After that,he picks and chooses the spots where he hikes.And he is rather proud of himself for having walked as many miles as he has.Bryson's subsequent travel books would not necessarily maintain this quality. This book would later become a movie in 2015,with Robert Redford and Nick Nolte playing Bryson and Katz. But I doubt if the movie could do justice to the sheer comic brilliance of the book.",89,15
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Ken-ichi,591,545,3,"May 7, 2009","Undoubtedly an amusing, breezy read, full of the kind of fun and hilarity all the blurbs lead you to expect. For instance, ""Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old."" That had me laughing on the train.I can't say I liked this book quite as much as some of my friends seem to. On the one hand, I've had at least 1 semi-grueling backpacking experience with a companion who was wholly unprepared for a rigorous day hike, let alone several of them on consecutive days, weighed down by tents, bags, and water, except my experience was less hilarious and more infuriating (even in retrospect, though there was certainly some hilarity). I also found Bryson fairly amusing, his fears and hijinks recognizable and diverting. On the other hand, he's kind of an ass. Seemed like every person he met was a subject for mockery. He also went off on these long jeremiads over the ecological devastation we've wrought on the Eastern forests, without citing any sources whatsoever, or recommending solutions. Obviously I agreed with the substance of those rants, but the dripping sarcasm in his indignation was just so annoying. Good researchers cite sources, and good crusaders at least try to find answers to the world's problems. Bryson seemed like more of a gadfly: buzzing, bothersome, but impotent. In the end, what I really wanted was just more depth. More analysis of what the trail means to Americans, what it symbolizes, a more informed (and documented) record of the Park Service's transgressions, more comparisons to similar trails in other parts of the world.

9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Miranda Reads,"1,588",15300,4,"December 11, 2020","Well, scratch the Appalachian Trail off my bucketlist. Bryson sets off to walk the Appalachian trail with only an extremely overpriced backpack (packed with equally ridiculously expensive gear), an old ""friend""  that he hadn't talked to in years and a will to find his next story. He quickly realized that the months of preparation he conducted (and the lack of months his friend prepared) were not nearly adequate. But on the plus side, he certainly found his story.As always, I absolutely enjoyed his signature sense of humor. Despite wandering around half crazed with fatigue, he still took the time to pen his quirky musings:
  Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old.
Joking aside, this is a brutal trail (no matter what Cheryl from Wild may say. Her little pot-shots against The Appalachian Trail were not justified). The sheer willpower it takes to slog through ten to twenty trail miles a day simply boggles my mind. 
  Distance changes utterly when you take the world on foot. A mile becomes a long way, two miles literally considerable, ten miles whopping, fifty miles at the very limits of conception.
I was weary just reading it - and he already most of the monotonous bits from his story. I appreciate how reading this allowed me to adventure vicariously and decide (most definitely) that I will never hike such a trail. Even part of it. 
  I'm not touching that thing with a ten-foot pole
I'll stick to my wood-chipped half-mile paths in the local park, thank you very much.Audiobook Comments---Am a smidge annoyed that he did not narrate his own autobiography (well micro-autobiography of a trail adventure (are micro-autos a thing?))---Narrator (Rob McQuay) was great though.

9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Jeff ,912,674,5,"June 3, 2014","Going into this book, I really had no idea of what to expect from Bill Bryson. Even though I picked this book up based on Diane’s terrific review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), I had never read the author before and let’s face it - blurbs on the cover only tell you so much. You have to read and live with an author’s prose to get a feel for it. As far as travelogues go, I don’t read many: Paul Theroux, Mark Twain and Steinbeck’s Travels with Charley are the only ones that come to mind. So I plunged in and I’m happy I did.Finding a rich source of humor (Monty Python, Archer, S.J. Pearlman, Deadpool) is always like Christmas Day. For me, humor has always been the fuel to motor through tough times and Mr. Bryson delivers it by the tank full. This book has a score of laugh out loud moments all weaved into Bryson’s cultural and historical insights.Bryson lived abroad for years and upon returning to the United States decided to hike the Appalachian Trail. The trail is over 2000 miles long and extends from Georgia into Maine. Along the way, Bryson discourses on subjects that range from the history of the Appalachian Trail, the neglect and incompetence of the Forestry and Park services, pre-Colonial botanists, the potential flame ball that is Centralia, PA, the temperature extremes of Mount Washington (NH), trees, the constant threat of getting eaten by bears or hogtied by hillbillies and, of course, the hike itself. The long, long hike.My experience with hiking and outdoorsy stuff begins and ends with the Boy Scouts. For me, it was about smoking cigarettes in the woods, being able to indiscriminately pee on the local flora, fauna and the occasional fellow scout (the latter, accidently, of course) wearing the same clothes and not bathing for three days. “You packed extra underwear and socks, Ma? I hadn’t noticed.” “The tooth brush is green because I dropped it in the creek. Don’t worry, I used it anyway.”If I were to go hiking today, I don’t think I would have picked the guy Bryson ended up with. Stephen Katz was overweight, needy, impetuous but funny. Kind of like hiking with my brother-in-law, minus the funny. The two are an unrivaled comic pair and their hiking adventures are a highly recommended read.",66,33
9791,A Walk in the Woods Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,Chrissie,"2,647",1486,2,"February 7, 2017","When I chose this book I failed to understand the author’s intention. Look at the subtitle! I hadn't noted the words ""Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail"". This book is not for people who love hiking; it is not intended to increase love of the sport. It scarcely shows the pleasure one can derive from hiking. It is instead a commentary on America with some details about the Appalachian Trail. I have to admit my own fault in not carefully reading the complete title. I still must rate according to my own appreciation of the book. For me it was just OK.This book is full of griping and whining. From its start to almost the very end. At the end there is a line or two that shows appreciation for hiking. For the purpose of delivering an exciting tale the author begins by listing all the terrible things that can happen and have happened on the trail. Bryson warns of getting lost, being bitten by snakes, eaten by bears, mauled by mountain lions and even being murdered. The complaining doesn't stop there. He tells of unpleasant people on the trail, the weight of the pack, hunger and tiredness, the expense and idiocy of trekking gear, even abstinence from sex and family and TV and soda pop and Little Debbie cakes and beer. He goes on to bemoan pollution, park authorities, deficient maps, modern American urbanization and expansion of roads to the point where one is unable to w-a-l-k by foot anywhere. Sure, some of the gripes certainly are legitimate, but a whole book of griping is hard to take, and the focus is scarcely on the delight of hiking. I love hiking. Beware, by no means does the author and his buddy Stephen Katz travel the whole trail. Do not expect a complete trail guide. They trek 500 miles, starting at the southern end, and then stop for a break, totally worn out by their experiences. They each go home, but Bryson then decides to cover portions of the trail by making day trips using his car. At this point the topics covered shift from trail experiences to information about historical events that have occurred at various places near the trail. The book sidetracks to cover events of the Civil War (Stonewall Jackson and Harper's Ferry), oil and anthracite mining, the smoking, inextinguishable underground mine fires of Centralia, Pennsylvania, as well as the ecological devastation at abandoned zinc mines at Palmerton in the same state. I name but a few examples. After Bryson’s solitary day excursions by car the two buddies meet up again to trek in Maine, finishing off with the “100 Mile Wilderness”. Well, I will not tell you what happens there, but you can pretty much guess. Anyone who knows anything about longer hiking tours knows that planning and careful preparation are essential. This includes critically assessing one’s own capabilities. Who says one has to trek the whole trail anyway? They finally realize that! Pseudonyms are used to protect the identity of those spoken of. Stephen Katz is a pseudonym too. When you read the book you will not be surprised at the need to cover up true identities. Many extremely uncomplimentary things are said. There are some humorous lines. There are some interesting historical details about the trail. There are some relevant insights about trekking which can be drawn from the book if you ponder what happens:-the first and second day are always the hardest.-it is easy to get lost.-don’t walk alone and inform others of your itinerary. -plan carefully water availability.-have proper clothing; weather can radically change.-take only what you really need. Every ounce feels like a ton when it is on your back. After a trek you will feel as though you are flying. After a trek you will appreciate the wonder of a warm shower and cleanliness. After a trek you will appreciate what before you have taken for granted – the ease of walking without gear, cooked food, being clean, and the beauty of nature. I wish this book had much more emphasis on what trekking can give a person. The audiobook is narrated by Rob McQuay. He does a fine job. Easy to follow and at a good clip. He expresses through his intonation both the lines of humor and the author’s criticism of modern American trends. The disdain is heard. **************************After 9 chapters:I am not exactly enjoying this, even if there are a few amusing lines. So much complaining. Such poor planning. And tell me why is there so little about the beauty of nature? The point with hiking is not to partake in a race or a competition to determine who does it fastest, in one swipe or in parts. Why would anyone have to do the-whole-thing? That is not the point. I prefer the empty Swedish mountain ranges.But I haven't given up on the book.",59,25
