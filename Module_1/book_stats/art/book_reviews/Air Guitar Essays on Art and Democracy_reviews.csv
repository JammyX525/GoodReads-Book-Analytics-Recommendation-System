140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Matt,82,24,5,"March 3, 2008","I was first introduced to Dave Hickey through one of my painting classes - my professor, who was found of giving supplementary readings, handed out a xeroxed chapter from this book. I hated it. I found Hickey to be smarmy and reactionary, and I disagreed with almost everything he wrote. A few months ago, however, I was reading a symposium in Art in America about the state of MFA programs. Hickey was one of the contributors, and much to my surprise, the most compelling. I still disagreed with him on many, if not all, of his points - he argues, for example, that a school attempting to shield its students from the art market is only doing a disservice to its students in the long run. Yet I found myself coming back to his piece several times - I enjoyed disagreeing with him more interesting and thought-provoking than nodding in complacence with some article I agreed with. Determined to give Air Guitar a second chance, I picked up a copy the next time I saw it in stores.Hickey remains a reactionary, but he's not a reactionary who wants to go back to the good ol' days of a simpler life. Rather, he longs for a time of rebellion - Hickey values Democracy as the highest possible value, and thinks that the best parts of human life flourish in the near anarchy of complete freedom. This is a far cry from someone like Tom Wolfe, who has simply ossified; his writings barely-shrouded complaints against ""the kids these days"" - generally as wrong as they are offensive. One of the strengths of Hickey's writing is that he makes no attempt to separate his artistic and cultural criticism from the autobiography in which they were formed. His views on the art market, for example, flow from his early involvement with hot-rodding cars - a group of DIYers using individual expressions as a way of subverting the hegemony of Detroit and the auto industry. Though one may not agree with his ultimate conclusions, they are such a logical outgrowth of his personal experiences that it's hard not to stop, and for one brief second, re-evaluate one's own position.

140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Jennifer,891,20,4,"March 26, 2015","This was a dense book, to say the least. A colleague of mine (with a BFA and MFA in tow) mentioned that he read a good bit of Dave Hickey in art school. I can believe it. I spent much of my time during the reading of this book thinking, ""Jesus, I need to write this stuff down, otherwise I'm going to forget it immediately."" Unfortunately, I didn't, so I did. I'm left at the end of this book feeling profoundly changed, yet I can't put my finger on the reasons why I liked this book so much. The writing was beautiful and complex, wistful and damning at the same time. Hickey comes down hard on the ""art world,"" with its methods of education, the dogmas of collecting, and its reactive frenzy around criticism. I'm disconnected from many of the things that he writes about - I can count on one hand the number of times I've been in a gallery. But I found his commentary so entertaining, so erudite, that I immediately felt immersed in this world. But he writes about more than just vagueries of art. My favorite essay in this book was ""The Heresy of Zone Defense."" I made copies of it and forced my basketball obsessed co-worker to read and comment on it. Hickey details the differences between college and professional basketball, speaks about the invention of the game, details a seminal basketball moment between Julius Erving and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in game 5 of the 1980 NBA finals, and compares all of it to interpretations of Jackson Pollack. Genius. The best moment of this essay comes at the end - he adds his own commentary to the original guiding principles of basketball as outlined by its inventor, James Naismith. A taste:5. The goal shall be horizontal and elevated.(The most Jeffersonian principle of all: Labor must be matched by aspiration. To score, you must work your way down court, but you must also elevate! Ad astra.)Other gems include the essays ""Air Guitar"", where he compares literary criticism to the ""flurries of silent, sympathetic gestures"" of the faux musician; ""A Rhinestone as Big as the Ritz,"" an essay on the realities of Liberace; ""Pontormo's Rainbow,"" Hickey's first encounter with an adult who Knew What Was Good For Him.Not every essay was a resounding success, but I enjoyed enough to recommend this book highly. Even if you aren't taking an art class. Or have never taken an art class. Nor are particularly interested in theory. It's still good.",2,2

First encountered his editorials in archives of LA magazine Art Issues, striking, rambling essays. It makes sense that most find his views surprising. In my view he is a Perennial thinker, which is why he is at once successful and unpopular. His business sense is also too pragmatic to appeal to the fantasy lottery economics many artists prefer to hear. Even his detractors are passionate about it.",2,N/A

For me, that short story alone was worth the price of admission. It remains one my favorite short stories and ought to be enshrined in one those thick-as-a- brick anthologies that are used in university undergraduate courses. ",2,N/A

140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Mike Polizzi,204,8,4,"April 20, 2022","It took a little patience but it’s a great collection of critical thought. It’s aged a little, but what he lays out regarding the art market and investment of commentary and capital is spot on given the online communities that flourish around art in all its forms. It’s best when he invests his time talking about Siegfried and Roy, Glow, Perry Mason and basketball. I appreciate the transparency he provides on his struggle with Cezanne and Ricky Jay and the detailed modernist reads he’s able to stand beside and reconsider. I really have the sense of strain he felt as a voice from both inside and outside academia and the art world. ",1 like,N/A

140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Matt,"1,503",46,4,"May 15, 2010","I feel a little bit like putting off writing about this book, but it's not as if my thoughts are likely to become any more clear, at least not till I read this book again two years from now.... I really really liked this, though it is not as advertised, at least not to me. I might be the only one, but I thought a book called _Air Guitar_ would be a celebration of exuberance, an embrace of amateurishness and passion and whatever else. Instead, it's kind of an indictment of the same: in the title essay, Hickey compares criticism to air guitar to take both down, as being non-productive, non-contributing parasites on the real thing.Of course, he says this because he wants criticism to do something better than that-- he doesn't want to write that kind of critcism, and by and large he doesn't. He also, and I think this is a separate strain, and not a part of the critique above, to break out of academic criticism, which he sees as he sees all academic-university pursuits, to take lessons from artists about what can be done, which he characterizes as freedom, and then education makes them rules: this is what you must do. The famous example is Pollock: Pollock shows you can drip paint, an increase in freedom, and the art teachers who follow him say you must drip paint.In essence, Hickey's book is a staged series of encounters of that sort: he'll engage an artist, or something like one, and try to discern what is the freedom behind the original impulse, as a tonic to the way that event or object or individual has been portrayed till now. It's site specific in that way, though also rooted in the larger progress of Hickey's life: child of bohemian parents, art student, then art dealer, musician, and now, I guess, an academic, but not of the sort he derides.Maybe the most surprising thing about the book, and it says something that it's a surprise, is the degree to which Hickey tries to persuade the reader, in the classic rhetorical sense: I'm so used to essayists being sort of free agents. Whether you're talking Ander Monson or Carl Wilson, it's like they are astronauts in this weird cosmos you'll never visit (even when you live there, you're not them, so it doesn't matter what they say) and they are sending back transmissions at a rate that it's too late to do anything about them..... In contrasts, though Hickey's book is dated (from 1996, I think, it feels at least a decade older than that, which might be the actual original pub date of some of the pieces) he really makes an effort to make you assent to what he's telling you. He really wants you to come along, which I don't know, it's kind of brave. Maybe it's because he wants me to agree that I find myself disagreeing with him, in a way I'd never disagree with Monson or Wilson, because with those two, there'd be no point in disagreeing. Or maybe it really is because of what Hickey says. But my experience of the Universities is really different than Hickey's. I mean, I know he's older than me and has more experience with these things. But I still can't help but think his experience of that level of freedom-denial is as idiosyncratic to his experience as anything else, and that Us can serve a different end, where they support and encourage stuff that doesn't belong on the market.But that's getting into a fairly complicated and lengthy disquisition, and no longer has much to do with what I thought about this book. And think about it I did-- it's a challenging read, or it was for me, and I'm nowhere near done thinking about it. So there's that. Until I read it again....",1 like,N/A

140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Michelle,12,3,5,"July 30, 2008","The 2008 Carnegie International’s curatorial theme was inspired by David Bowie’s song, Life on Mars. While I’m a huge fan of Bowie (and his turquoise suit and eye shadow in the 1973 video by Mick Rock), I was mildly skeptical when the Carnegie’s head curator, Douglas Fogle, decided to use this song as a point of thematic departure for what was supposed to be a significant survey of contemporary art. On further contemplation, I had to give points to Fogle for his brazen ability to harness Bowie’s optimistic confusion and even saw how the expanse of Bowie’s repertoire could fuel years of curatorial inspiration. Visual art is dangerously close to a point where it may be viewed as largely elitist and self-referential and pulling it back into the realm of rock stars’ musings can only be a good thing. It’s not banal, it’s genuine and unpretentious and I feel that David Hickey would wholeheartedly agree. It’s this genuine and unpretentious outlook on art which is so appealing in Air Guitar, Hickey’s seminal text on contemporary art and culture. Hickey took the shopworn dialog about blurring the distinction between high and low art to a magnificent new level in this work. Infused with optimism and wit, Air Guitar takes an honest and insightful look at the dependency of fine arts on popular culture. Unlike Chuck Klosterman who seems to drop cultural references for the sake of dropping them, Hickey manages to use references to create a connect-the-dots map of a democratic art world. He manages to create a no-nonsense picture of art in America without cheapening it, using things such as a German semi-automatic pistol, Tom and Jerry, and the American automobile as devices to segue into truly delightful dialogs about commerce and representation. Throughout, Hickey’s tone drips with non-ironic optimism, a rarity to find in any text about contemporary art and culture. And, oh my, the end papers in the 1997 edition I’m reading are embossed with a floral design. What can I say -- I’m a sucker for expensive flairs hidden a modest trade paperback. It’s like a detail found in a teenage girl’s diary and is in keeping with the exuberance of the text within. ",1 like,N/A
140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Patty Gone,52,3,5,"October 4, 2013","I began reading this last year per my friend David's suggestion, and got through a few essays but was bogged in other things, yet over the course of the year, I'd think of it: I'd encounter art or beauty in something without artistic intention and be blasted to Hickey's appreciation of Rockwell and of The Strip, his repudiation of self-righteous sentimentalism and the academically obscure. I returned to it this summer, and its views burst my synapses again. Hickey's strength is his parallels, how the plot of every Perry Mason episode is a model for the rock'n'roll band and the democratic family unit, how zone defense in basketball aligns with risk-averse art institutionalism. It's a playlist of love songs, but all songs are sad songs, and he mourns a time when one could make a living on writing alone, an autonomy free of the tenure-track, free of the Whitney Museum acting as General Motors, homogenizing art, leaving no room for the tricked-out car or the magazine writer.",1 like,N/A

Not only because I can't comment on the quality of the content, but also because it is not comparable to any other 4 star books.Now why did I give this 4 stars? Mainly because I liked what I took away from reading this book. I learned a lot about art criticism and a different way of looking at it, than art critics may suggest/imply.I feel more confident about my thoughts on art and voicing my opinions. The writing in the book is also very enjoyable, not all essays are great, or interesting but they tell you about his life and his perspective on it. I found Dave Hickey's life inspiring and calming at the same time, as well as fascinating.If you are interested in reading books about the art world I think this is a good one, as it looks at the way art is criticised and perceived differently, as far as I know.",1 like,N/A
140987,Air Guitar Essays on Art and Democracy,Troy,300,134,5,"January 7, 2009","In this book Dave Hickey covers the connections between art and democracy. Basically he talks about the way art (and culture in general) creates ""cults of desire."" Basically cults of desire, while nominally constrained by background, can also cross cultural divides. So a group of people from various backgrounds can from a cult of desire around an art work that they all love. (Imagine, for example, a group of rich, poor, black, and white kids all joining together in their love of hip hop.) Anyway, these groups subvert the standard divisions and can have wild effects on the larger culture. Of course, it's a lot more than that, and Hickey is a fantastic writer who is full of fascinating anecdotes.",1 like,N/A
