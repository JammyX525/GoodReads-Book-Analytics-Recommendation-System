52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Michael,657,969,4,"March 16, 2020","A wide-ranging debut collection of essays on art, film, and literature that’s as stimulating today as it was when it was first released in the ‘60s. Sontag’s caustic wit, sharp prose, and succinct observations about aesthetics make all the essays worth reading, even though many of her ideas have long since been absorbed into the mainstream. Here, she examines everything from existentialist thought to the tropes of science fiction, and her mind’s always interesting to follow.",67,2
52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,DoctorM,836,2,4,"December 16, 2012","There was a time, long ago and in another age, when anyone at university who wanted to be well-read or conversant with things intellectual read this book. I'm one of them. I sat in Cross Campus at New Haven and devoured ""Against Interpretation"" one autumn afternoon. Needless to say, I had a deep intellectual crush on Susan Sontag--- ah, I thought, if only I'd been able to court her in some alternate New York where we were both eighteen or nineteen! I still love this book, all these years later. It brings up an age when ideas mattered, when there was passion in the air about sweeping away old thoughts and discovering and valorising the new. The title essay and ""Notes on Camp"" remain...well...brilliant. A classic book, then--- more than just a reminder of the world of my Lost Youth. Sontag was fierce and infuriating and witty and opinionated and razor-sharp and often wrongheaded and deeply engaged in art and politics and culture--- someone whose voice was there shaping debates and offering up alternatives. I miss that kind of passion in the intellectual world. And I do recommend this book--- read it and learn how to love the clash of ideas. ",61,5
52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,J.L.   Sutton,650,825,4,"February 2, 2022","“To interpret is to impoverish, to deplete the world—in order to set up a shadow world of “meanings.”Susan Sontag's Against Interpretation and Other Essays offers an intellectual back and forth on how to approach art and ends up showing us, above all else, a mind at work. That was really the most fun part of this. In the opening essay, Sontag argues that interpretation is an act that replaces the meaning of art, be it writing, theater, film or painting. I like the point Sontag makes, and understand that any interpretation or review we read colors how we come to a work of art, but I don't see this as something that necessarily limits our experience. In fact, Sontag's other essays in this collection add new dimensions to how I will experience writers such as Marcel Proust, Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre among others. “A work of art encountered as a work of art is an experience, not a statement or an answer to a question. Art is not only about something; it is something. A work of art is a thing _in_ the world, not just a text or commentary _on_ the world.”",54,4

It includes some of Sontag's best-known works, including ""On Style,"" and the eponymous essay ""Against Interpretation."" In the last, Sontag argues that in the new approach to aesthetics the spiritual importance of art is being replaced by the emphasis on the intellect. Rather than recognizing great creative works as possible sources of energy, she argues, contemporary critics were all too often taking art's transcendental power for granted, and focusing instead on their own intellectually constructed abstractions like ""form"" and ""content."" In effect, she wrote, interpretation had become ""the intellect's revenge upon art."" The essay famously finishes with the words, ""in place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art"".

52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Zanna,676,926,3,"August 7, 2015","None of us can ever retrieve that innocence before all theory when art knew no need to justify itself, when one did not ask of a work of art what it said because one knew what it did. From now to the end of consciousness, we are stuck with the task of defending art.I ended up finding 'Against Interpretation' useful. Its central claim is that there is a kind of interpretation that is anti-art in that it diminishes the possibilities for appreciating/enjoying/experiencing the art rather than increasing them, which is what criticism (I would still say interpretation*) should (probably) do. I have no longer any anxiety on behalf of the author, but I still generally dislike the kind of interpretation that Sontag seems to be talking about; the kind that says one thing is another in a text and tyrannically insists on this translation. She argues that even if the interpretation that A Streetcar Named Desire is about the decline of Western civilization rather than this encounter between two interesting characters is 'correct' in the sense of being intended and implicit, this is precisely what is weak and 'contrived' about it. In my review of To the Lighthouse I felt the need to criticise both of the introductions, which I suppose is me fighting on behalf of the text or of my experience of the text. I evidently feel that something I want to remain open is being closed down when a psychoanalytic interpretation (for instance) is advanced. However, I am eager to read interpretation and criticism - this is definitely part of my pleasure in the text (Sontag ends by saying 'we need an erotics of art rather than a hermeneutics'), not only a way to get more pleasure out of it. Considering Zadie Smith's introduction to Their Eyes were Watching God I can think of the text as a mountain, which has a nice easy path over it, and Smith's introduction as a kit which contains a map to find the hidden caves and a torch to illuminate their beautiful interiors. So Smith helps me to get more out of reading Hurston, but her intro is art in itself (it is aesthetic; Sontag says the aesthetic is 'that which needs no justification'). I'd say criticism/interpretation helps me rather than hinders/irritates me more than half of the time... I don't think the value of the critic is so low(((*I am very keen on the word 'interpretation'. The specific meaning it has in museums (phenomenology!) for me from my background (my mum is a heritage educator and I volunteered with her often for many years) is probably a reason for this; when I go to an exhibition I talk about the interpretation - the British Museum have a very high standard of interpretation; if you visited the Ice Age Art exhibition you will remember how much interpretation there was, and how much was needed, to enable such a coherent, pungent (can I say that? I could smell blood and salt in that exhibition...) experience out of a small collection of tiny objects which, the interpretation text repeatedly admitted, WE LACK THE ABILITY TO DECODE in terms of what they 'really' meant to the people who made and used them. Conversely, in many museums stuff is heaped up in glass cases with labels like 'brass, c.1500'. Unless an object has overwhelming aesthetic qualities, creative interpretation by people with learning and passion is a necessary bridge for most of us to experience more than a sort of obligatory, intimidated STUDIUM in its presence. Some people find the British Museum's approach overbearing, but I disagree; I think it's ableist and elitist and ethnocentric to insist that the objects should 'speak for themselves'. For most of us, they will remain silent.)))((I now have a better way to describe my resistance to The Unbearable Lightness of Being: Sontag describes Thomas Mann (who I haven't read) hilariously as 'overcooperative' in that he inserts intimations of the correct interpretation into his texts. This is exactly what Kundera does that I dislike!))The second essay ‘On Style’ is about the false dichotomy of form and content, and her prescription to critics to think more about the former, because our idea of content, especially as something hidden inside form or style is a hindrance. It makes us think of an art work as a statement somehow packaged. Sontag tries to explain why there is no distinction between ethics and aesthetics, but somehow I can’t get a handle on her treatment of this. Later on in another essay ‘One culture and the new sensibility’ she says most artists have abandoned the ‘Matthew Arnold idea of culture', which is ‘art as the criticism of life… understood as the propounding of moral, social and political ideas’. In 
  Status Anxiety
 Alain de Botton explains the view that Arnold sets out in Culture and Anarchy like this: “art as a protest against the state of things, an effort to correct our insights or to educate us to perceive beauty, to help us understand pain or to reignite our sensitivities, to nurture our capacity for empathy or to rebalance our moral perspective.” I’m not sure who is making mush here, because Sontag argues in ‘On Style’ that art can teach us to be more ethical because the mode of being needed to contemplate art is a useful rehearsal for the mode required for ethical behaviour, which is just a ‘form of acting’ or ‘code of acts’, and goes on to say in many of these essays that art 'educates the feelings', 'nourishes' us, 'sends us out refreshed'. This seems close to de Botton’s notes on Arnold, to me at least. It suggests the difference is of degree and there is a sort of continuum between socialist realism at one end and Oscar Wilde at the other, but Sontag seems to be aiming for a more radical reassessment. I’m troubled by Sontag’s rejection of art-as-argument, as I’m not satisfied with her account of morality. It remains my obsession to see the political and ethical in everything. If someone can write that ‘being a feminist is passe’ then I can’t trust her.I enjoyed her comments on the ‘arbitrary and unjustifiable’ in works of art. She argues that what is inevitable in a work of art is its style, an expression of the author’s will. Her main purpose in 'On Style' is, I think, to advise critics to find form in content rather than the converse. The rest of the book is mainly criticism of theatre, film and other works in which she apparently tests her own medicine. It sounds good, if you don’t mind being told flatly and frequently that some work is brilliant or vile… I have seen/read little of the material she reviews; I’m unhappy with her negative critique of an exception to that: James Baldwin, and I was unable to get through some of the literature she recommends that I sought out! However, her ‘Notes on “Camp”’ is rightly famous I think; it shows great sensitivity and acuity that she can delineate it so gracefully.Writing in the sixties, she found nothing going on in literature. The novel is dead, she would have agreed. Innovations in form were the leading edge, and literature lagged. I wonder if she would say that now.Despite reservations, I feel a sharp, refreshing breeze blowing on my face; Sontag opened a window.",37,10
52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Prerna,215,1203,3,"July 1, 2021","In the first volume of her journal Reborn, Susan Sontag wrote that to interpret is to determine, to restrict; or to exfoliate, read meaning into. Perhaps she was deliberate in her focus on form, in her evasions of definitions within this collection of disparate essays that range from critiques of philosophy, art, movies to blatant sixties style fangirling. Perhaps it was her own refusal to be restricted, to be read into, that she transmuted into a writing that has a clear, traceable form and yet is inscrutable. There isn't a unifying theme to these essays, instead it's the contours of the form (that Sontag herself believed was of more merit in art theory than interpretation) that takes the centre stage.You're not sure what the extensive notes on camp or the barely four-pages long essay on Simone Weil are actually supposed to mean. At least I wasn't. Instead, what resonates here is Sontag's hallmark confidence, and you're convinced that she absolutely believed in everything she wrote, everything she said. And this remarkable confidence helped me read on even when certain parts of this book got surprisingly boring.Sontag also firmly believed that morality informs experience and that's very evident in her criticisms. She approaches each topic with a predetermined notion of style and form, almost as if the style itself selects the topics she wants to write on. But that would be a wrong interpretation. Her style of writing is so firm, so intelligent that everything else seems secondary.",34,8

  What a work of art does is to make us see or comprehend something singular, not judge or generalize.
To bask in intelligent discourse of literature, fine arts, and theatre, is to turn to Susan Sontag's Against Interpretations, where the cultured world is viewed aesthetically. Serious conversations elude the personal, criticism becomes communion with art, wherein the reader is almost an after-thought because the dialogue is the writer, the intellectual musing, and the subject. The prose pulsates with controlled meandering and gets to the heart of a matter that a regular observer hasn't considered. Even if you didn't know that Sontag owned a 15,000-book personal library or that she attended numerous events and 'happenings' that made her a literary celebrity, you sense this through the exploration and confidence on the page. She was determined to exist outside of academic circles (although her writing has a pedagogical slant), outside of mainstream journalism; a ""pugnacious aesthete"" and ""moralist,"" she saw herself as a ""newly minted warrior in a very old battle.""There is also the thought that one wouldn't have wanted to be the writer, film director, or creator who ended up on the other end of her criticism, for her opinions slash deeply, sometimes perhaps unfairly. Her writing was deeply analytical, her thoughts sometimes ironic (""what would criticism look like that would serve the work of art, not usurp its place?""). At one point Sontag, after publishing Illness as Metaphor & AIDS and Its Metaphors first as a few essays, revised some passages to give her words a lesser edge, and in some cases a different meaning, but also to fit her current views, her current experiences. Although very opinionated, she was known to change her mind often. So is the metamorphosis of a writer, particularly one in the public eye, one with a life-changing illness, the same one criticized for her writing after September 11. Whether one likes the direction of her criticism or not, whether one relishes her persuasive pedantry or not, it's clear that the essays in this collection are singular in style and uniquely relevant to time, place and culture: ""the world in which these essays were written no longer exists."" My favorites were ""On Style,"" and ""Camus' Notebooks.""",32,11
52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Glenn Sumi,404,1493,4,"April 3, 2022","Like most collections (of essays or stories), this book – Susan Sontag’s first – is uneven. Some pieces are absolutely brilliant, making me see art and culture in a whole new way, while a few are so esoteric and dull I couldn’t wait to be done with them.What ties them together is Sontag’s erudition, passion and enthusiasm for what she’s writing about – what she’s thinking. To borrow a line from Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton, Sontag’s writing shows you a mind at work.“Before I wrote the essays I did not believe many of the ideas espoused in them,” she writes in the book’s introduction. “When I wrote them, I believed what I wrote; subsequently, I have come to disbelieve some of these same ideas again – but from a new perspective.” I appreciate her honesty.The essays include now-famous pieces like “Notes on ‘Camp’” and “Against Interpretation” (both timeless) as well as extended meditations on the works of Claude Levi-Strauss, Simone Weil and Nathalie Sarraute. She thinks a lot about the connections between style and content. Her taste in books and films is more European than American, with long essays – you couldn’t really call them reviews – on Sartre’s book on Jean Genet, the films of Robert Bresson and Jean-Luc Godard (alas, written before the former’s masterpieces Au Hassard Balthazar and Mouchette) and a deep dive into Alain Renais’s Muriel. I’d seen many of the films she discussed, but am now curious to watch them again – especially Godard’s Vivre Sa Vie – with her clear and persuasive analyses in mind. It’s to Sontag’s credit that even though I hadn’t read most of the books she referred to, I was intrigued enough to read all the way through her essays on them. I doubt I’ll ever read a Sarraute novel, but I’m now curious. And I appreciate the way Sontag draws on her knowledge of all the arts – visual, music, film, theatre, opera, dance, literature – to illustrate what’s new and inventive. In fact, that was my main takeaway from this book. I’ve heard of the “happenings” of the 60s, but Sontag takes us to a few and explains/shows what they’re attempting to do. Her round-up of plays in New York (“Going to theatre, etc.”) includes a highly critical takedown of Arthur Miller’s After The Fall, which launched the Lincoln Center Repertory Theater, as well as shrewd and often hilariously bitchy criticisms of lauded pieces involving Gielgud and Scofield. She’s most interesting on new works by Rolf Hochhuth, James Baldwin and Amiri Baraka, although her thinking and language around race seems a little dated.She devotes an entire essay to Peter Brook’s production of Peter Weiss’s Marat/Sade, a groundbreaking work I’ve heard so much about. Her description of it makes me now feel like I’ve seen it.I’d never heard of “The Imagination of Disaster,” her clever analysis of cheesy science-fiction movies and their political, social and cultural dimensions. It’s now one of my favourite Sontag essays. I love that she spent so much time and energy on what many critics of the time must have thought of as a crude and unsophisticated genre. She didn’t care about concepts of “high” or “low” culture. I’ll likely reread this piece – as well as perhaps half a dozen others – again. And I’m definitely going to seek out her later collections. She must have been quite a trailblazer in the 1960s and 70s. In the current cultural landscape, I can’t think of anyone attempting to do what she did, with such boldness, style and probing intelligence.",28,10
52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Steven Godin,"2,279",2147,4,"January 7, 2020","I loved 'On Photography', it's one of the best essays I've read. Some of her others however, I haven't thought much of. This collection of essays and criticism from the 1960s is certainly one of the better Sontag books I've read. It flatters the reader's intelligence without being intimidating. From Sophocles to Sartre, it seems that Sontag has read everything, and has the gift of getting her ideas across in reader-friendly prose, something that isn't shared by all those in the same boat as her. The title essay is an attack on the mimetic theory of art, and on the cult of interpretation that it has spawned. While On Style is a spirited attack on the division between form and content – an entirely spurious one in her view – arguing that one should be able to appreciate Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will as a masterpiece despite its Nazi propaganda. Some of the others were just as good, and Sontag being a stern critic means readers will always find plenty of things to disagree with. But the essays are unfailingly stimulating. Though they bear the stamp of their time, Sontag was remarkably prescient.",25,N/A

52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Greg Brown,294,59,5,"December 11, 2013","There don't seem to be as many public intellectuals around as there used to be. Sure, there are more commentators than ever—look at the many, many bloggers out there, as well as other individuated voices carving out their own identity, even within larger publications. But the public intellectual in the middle of the 20th century seemed to comprise something different, something a bit larger in scope. These days, criticism tends to be done piecewise, either commenting or reacting incrementally on each new publication or event, or slowly embodying a larger critique through the slow, steady work of embodying it.Sontag and other writers of her era offer a different model, one with well-polished fusillades and other attacks levied against their contemporaries. The grasp of these essays seem to be more wide-ranging, composed than today's blog posts—not just because they're more formally edited, but because by necessity they have to encompass so much more. There was the electrifying intellectual community in New York that met, discussed, and argued in person, of course. But there wasn't twitter, blogs, anything that could be used for large amounts of smaller pieces. Instead, Sontag and others worked through periodicals like the New York Review of Books, or the Partisan Review. These published maybe bi-weekly or monthly at most, meaning that they could only run so much, and that any reaction had to necessarily stand the test of time more than a snap blog-post that'll be obsolete in days.This isn't necessarily to bemoan the current condition, only to recognize that a certain sensibility is so hard to find these days, and that you have to really seek it out compared to earlier. The New York Review of Books still exists (and continues to put out superb work), but it isn't the center of the intellectual conversation the way it used to be. They just Wrote Differently back then, in a way that's hard to articulate without reading Didion, Sontag, Wilson, and others.This, then is to say that Sontag comes across as very refreshing—not just because she's intellectually brilliant (which she is), or that she provides a novel way of looking at art (which she does), but because she writes so damn well that it's hard not to be carried away by her conclusions because they just sound so damn good.Sontag's larger point that ""form"" and ""content"" are often unjustly separated, and the latter elevated above the former, is laid out in the very first title essay, and expounded upon or eliptically mentioned in almost every single other essay. The effect, which would be less noticable in reading each essay individually, is to see her argument substantiated in the richness of its results. In elevating content above form (and I'll dispense with the air quotes, even though Sontag justly uses them throughout), we cut off the ways in which how a work formally functions determines its aim and effect on the audience. In a certain sense, focusing on the content reveals an impoverished vocabulary or schema for understanding a given art-form, a mistake that Sontag dearly wants to correct by foregrounding how a work... well, works!And to her credit, Sontag's argument has seen an effect in much of the art criticism since. In film, for example, editing is now recognized as one of the (if not THE) attributes that determine the essence of a movie. In games, we see mechanics-oriented criticism on the rise, though that case is easier to make with the more explicit interaction compared to the way other art-forms will subtly shift our attention around. While a good chunk of the book is concerned with this kind of meta-criticism, there are some more traditional criticism of specific works—valuable because they instantiate and substantiate her larger program, but still kind of floaty if you haven't experienced the works she's talking about. When she's writing to introduce a body of work to the audience, such as some of the foreign thinkers, or her entertaining essay about the ""happenings,"" she is lively and enjotable throughout. But when she's writing an apologia for work she expects her intellectual community to already know, it can leave the average reader in the dark.This weakness is partially a function of time (since contemporary works aren't so contemporary any more) but also of the widening intellectual pluralism that she herself champions in essays like the famous ""Notes on Camp."" And in that, at least, the drawbacks are to be excused and even celebrated.",15,N/A
52374,Against Interpretation and Other Essays,Jonfaith,"1,821",1319,4,"September 5, 2019","Jerking off the universe is perhaps what all philosophy, all abstract thought is about: am intense, and not very sociable pleasure, which has to be repeated again and again. That's Ms. Sontag on Genet, in lieu of discussing Sartre's Saint Genet. I find it an amazing analogy for thinking and I'm curious what Heidegger would have thought of the affront? There are attendant opportunities which have to be ignored. Yet it lingers and I contemplate.Against Interpretation was Sontag's first collection of essays and it dazzles, though the range of such is certainly circumscribed. Her point is made by citing certain authors. What about other authors with contrasting perspectives? Don't worry about that, because she hasn't read them yet. Despite that preening, she is a formidable reader. I really enjoyed the pieces on Camus, Pavese and Lukács . Her takedown of Ionesco was brilliant if overzealous and finally her stomping of Walter Kaufmann may have appeared less pathetic in 1962. One shouldn’t disabuse in the name of clarity, it borders on bullying and is seen as unseemly in certain circles—so I’m told.I didn't care as much for the theatre reviews and the digressions on film, even if it was Godard and Bresson. The Notes on Camp is timeless and necessary but about a quarter of the others are petty and ephemeral.",10,N/A
