13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Lisa,750,131,5,"November 7, 2014","We enjoyed this beautifully illustrated book about the life of Horace Pippin! Sometimes when we finish reading a really good book, we head right over to Google to investigate further. We think Horace Pippin was a great artist! We admire his perseverance and courage. We think everyone should google Horace Pippin today and get to know the work of this truly great self-taught American painter! This book gets a unanimous five stars from The Eggers!",11,2
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Moonkiszt,"1,922",205,3,"January 30, 2022","Featured in a grandma reads session.Exactly what the title says it is, A Splash of Red: the life and art of Horace Pippin was a charming addition to our group's focus on artists in January 2022. Providing his life story and experiences showed these young people how a person's life impacts later passions, expressions of that passion and how one spends the time they are allotted on this sweet little dirt ball careening through space. Horace was arty from his childhood. He was self-taught and drew pictures for the people in his life. When WWI broke out, Horace joined up and found himself in the trenches, and when it was all over, he had a hand that had lost its ability to paint. . . so for the rest of his life, one hand helped the other do the actual painting.With samples of his work, and the inspirational stories of his life, I'm glad we found a book about Horace to add to the great artists we've learned about this month. Grateful for the authors and illustrators who bring forward people, things, and experiences we might have missed in our patchwork educations.",7,N/A

13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Agnė,744,57,3,"August 16, 2017","A Splash of Red: The Life and Art of Horace Pippin is a well-researched picturebook biography of an esteemed self-taught African-American painter:Since I knew nothing about Horace Pippin or his art before, I appreciated Jen Bryant's informative narrative. However, her writing in A Splash of Red is not the most engaging.Melissa Sweet's boldly colored mixed media illustrations, on the other hand, are as beautiful and original as ever:",6,9
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Abigail,"7,083",173,4,"February 20, 2021","Author Jen Bryant and illustrator Melissa Sweet, who also collaborated on the picture-book biographies 
  The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus

  A River of Words: The Story of William Carlos Williams
, return to the form in this wonderful examination of the life of African-American artist Horace Pippin. Born on Washington's birthday - January 22nd - in 1888, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Pippin discovered his love for making pictures at an early age, winning an art contest when he was eight. Whatever else he was doing - and he had to work many different kinds of jobs, to help his family - he was always making art. Injured while serving in World War I - he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre and the Purple Heart - he returned home with a right arm that was almost useless. Slowly, through hard work and determination, he trained himself to use this arm again, continuing to make his paintings. Eventually, his work was discovered and promoted by such figures as painter N.C. Wyeth, and he went on to become a well-known painter...I am so very glad that I picked up A Splash of Red: The Life and Art of Horace Pippin, as I had not previously heard of this artist, but will now seek out more of his work. His life story is certainly inspirational, as he battled all sorts of disadvantages and challenges - poverty, racial discrimination, the physical and psychological wounds of war - in order to go on making his art. I would certainly like to know more about him, and about his work. Jen Bryant's text here is simple but informative, and is paired with Sweet's appealing, mixed-media artwork, which incorporates quotations from Pippin himself. The back matter contains more information about Pippin, as well as notes from the author and illustrator, and lists of further reading ideas and other online resources. I was interested to see, from the notes, that Bryant and Sweet worked together on this, while doing their research, as this is quite atypical in contemporary American picture-book production, where the author and artist often times have no communication. This collaborative method certainly has produced a wonderful result here! Recommended to young art lovers, and to picture-book readers looking for stories about artists, about people overcoming challenges, or about veterans and their post-war experiences.",3,2
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Michelle,293,1 follower,4,"July 10, 2013","Audience: PrimaryGenre: Non-Fiction/InformationalBook Talk...Have you ever known a person who never gave up on his/her talents?A Splash of Red is a story of one such person.

13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Sunday,887,45,5,"September 1, 2019","Great for reading aloud to k-2. Bryant tells the story of a young boy (and then man) whose obligations frequently got in the way of his art and yet he found time to be an artist AND those around him wanted to see his art. There's a repetitive phrase ""Make a picture for us!"" the ____ (classmates, sisters, workers, etc) said. And Horace did."" The use of this repetitive phrase gets at the power of art for Horace and for other people in his world. Sweet's illustrations are invitingly complex, worthy of looking at closely to see how she incorporated her research on Pippin into her own art.SUGGESTIONS FOR AN INTERACTIVE READ ALOUD -1) Read aloud the book for the pure joy of learning about Horace Pippin.2) Read aloud again, pausing at a few places to ask students higher-level thinking questions that delve into the type of person Horace Pippin was like  *What do these first two pages about WWI reveal about the what Horace was experiencing?  How do you think he felt? What makes you think so?  *How does the author reveal that Pippin was a hard worker before the war? After the war?  *How does he work hard to overcome his injury and draw again? What does this say about him?3) Read aloud and focus on the author's use of language or Sweet's integration of Pippin's words. What did Pippin mean when he said, ""The war brought out all the art in me""? Why do you think Bryant uses the repetitive phrase ""Make a picture for us...and Horace did""? How do Pippin's ""big hands"" play an important part in this narrative?Don't skip the author's and illustrator's notes at the end! Bryant and Sweet explain their research which is important to think about if readers are pondering the accuracy and authority of the text.Robert Sibert Honor BookSchneider Family Book Award",2,N/A
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Elsa Mathews,5,2,4,"July 11, 2022","I discovered artist Horrace Pippin because this spring I bought a few heirloom pepper plants that we owe to him for saving the seeds and passing them on to others. After reading a bit about his life on Baker Creek Seeds’ website, I decided to dig into learning about his life and work a little more. Unfortunately, this book doesn’t talk about his gardening, but it is a good introduction to his life and art!",2,N/A

13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Lindsey,919,22,4,"January 24, 2015","A gorgeous picture book about the life of Horace Pippin. Like many artists, he grew up loving to draw. He drew and painted pictures for friends. While fighting in World War I, his shoulder was wounded and he could no longer paint without the control and same movement of his right hand. After some time, Horace realized that he wanted to make art so badly that he'd try to work around his injury. By holding his injured hand, he made art and eventually his artwork became famous. This was a very positive story showing how injury and obstacles can be overcome with determination. I particularly enjoyed the map illustrations showing Horace traveling to France to fight in the war. The map and war pictures have a very different style from the rest of the book, which made it more interesting visually. ",2,N/A
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Samantha,"4,985",59,4,"February 8, 2013","A picture book bio about self-taught painter Horace Pippin. His life and the beginnings of his art are paralleled and his world is brought to life through Sweet's watercolor, gouache, and collage artwork. Both an author and illustrator's note follows the story and a further reading list, film reference, website list, and quotation sources are included.Every inch of the book is jam-packed with information including the title page which includes a reproduction of one of Pippin's biblical paintings and the inside back cover which lays out on a hand-drawn map museums that house Pippin paintings. This duo does an amazing job of inciting interest in their subject and providing great starting sources for further exploration. The artwork is so rich and detailed that it invites rereadings and inspires the reader to view Pippin's work in person. ",2,N/A
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Penny Peck,498,18,5,"February 3, 2014","Picture book biographies are always welcome but this one has something extra that makes it memorable, focusing on a person that will resonate after reading. Although the text is relatively brief, it contains quite a bit of information on African-American painter Horace Pippin, from his youth, to his service in WWI, to his later success as a painter. The clipped sentences are perfect for the subject matter, including his WWI injury and slow recovery: ""One day, he climbed to the top of the trench. A shot rang out. Horace felt pain in his shoulder. He was hit!"" The full color watercolor paintings (with collage elements) that illustrate the book also add to the package, evocative of Pippin's folk art style. An excellent choice for teachers, for Black History Month, and for budding artists. ",2,N/A
13642600,A Splash of Red The Life and Art of Horace Pippin,Susan,"2,280",64,4,"March 27, 2016","I enjoyed this book. It is a biography of Horace Pippin, an artist that I was unfamiliar with, but also a bit of a 'coming of age' book too as Horace tries different occupations before and after the war before coming to the fact that he is, indeed, an artist. I enjoyed that the protagonist happens to be of African heritage, and have since noticed that this informed his work. I also enjoyed that Pippin was able to persevere over the wound that he got during the war that originally he thought would end his ability to create art. ",2,N/A

What a moving set of quotations were used in the illustrations. And the fact that he shook hands with a white man and got his own show were awesome to learn about. Lots of enriching supplementary material including a photo of him and images of some of his most significant works on the last endpapers.,2,N/A
