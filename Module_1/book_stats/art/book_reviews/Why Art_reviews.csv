35407505,Why Art,Jon Nakapalau,"4,742",634,5,"July 10, 2022",Immersive and inquisitive - unique perspective on the motivational aspects of creating art. 'Art for art's sake' examined in a very deep way; (strangely echoing the song of the same name by 10cc). I think the philosophy of art is truly one of the most underappreciated aspects of insight into culture - a very deep reflection on this in this GN.,37,5
35407505,Why Art,Adam Stone,"1,454",19,2,"March 8, 2018","Is art blue? Is it orange? How big is art? These questions and more are involved in Eleanor Davis's ""Why Art?""There are several five star reviews already about how wonderful this book is, and about how they are going to sleep with it next to their bed. I'm very happy people have found joy in this book. For me, it seemed really empty. An artist who is himself flimsy is made of paper maiche.A performance artist who sincerely says ""I love you"" to her audience is sincere.So?I had the same sense of ""shrug emoji"" that I had reading Rupi Kaur's poetry. These statements and ideas seem like they should be deep, but they don't actually say anything, and provide me with no emotional connection to, well, anything.It does revisit its revelations about characters by the end, so it builds to...something.I guess I would recommend it to people who like Instagram poetry but wish it had a long, disjointed narrative.",20,2
35407505,Why Art,Stewart Tame,"2,280",87,3,"November 25, 2018","Hmmm … this wasn't what I was expecting. For some reason I thought this was going to be nonfiction, a meditation on the whats and whys of Art. I suppose, on some level, it is exactly that. But on the surface at least, it's a dreamlike journey that explores Art as a metaphor for life, or life as a metaphor for Art. Or both. Or neither. As you’ve probably guessed, it resists easy interpretation.Honestly, I’m kind of underwhelmed. It's good for what it is, but, as far as trippy, arty comics go, it's fairly average. I don't hate it. I don't love it. I don't really regret having read it, but it just ultimately was not particularly memorable. ",11,4
35407505,Why Art,Gabriel,285,4,5,"July 27, 2018","Why everything Eleanor Davis creates is so perfect and beautiful? I'm stunned really so sensitive so deep so poetic, I just love Eleanor Davis. I really recommend this.But if the toxic masculinity in this society has affected that much that you can't read poetry without feeling violate this is not for you and I think it's not the job of author deconstruct your fear of sensitivity, it's yours, so don't be a as;)ole.",8,N/A

35407505,Why Art,Ashita Thakur,127,28,3,"January 4, 2020","A surprising 15 minute read where Eleanor delves into conversation around our relationship with art as audiences and creators. It is humorous and tongue in cheek but not as deep as it is purported to be. Maybe I’ve read too many art related books lately but her message reminded me of Instagram poetry in some places and pseudo philosophy in others.I did enjoy her humour and some ideas that she raises, but going through the reviews it seems like people love this because it’s by this Eleanor person who everyone loves. My lack of context however didn’t make me expect anything and from a virgin Eleanor reader it was okay I guess but not excellent.However, I will add that it’s short length and easy writing mean that I might read it again whenever I want to read something short and artistic.",6,N/A
35407505,Why Art,Rod Brown,"4,943",162,3,"May 31, 2018","Davis takes a tongue-in-cheek look at her title question while managing to be just a bit profound. From the opening pages (""Orange artworks. Blue ones. Both orange and blue ones."") made me laugh out loud and think immediately of This Is Not an Apple and Dr. Seuss. That sense of playfulness continues throughout with some digressions into deeper pain, especially the performance artist section. Clever overall, but a bit too odd for me in the end.",6,N/A

35407505,Why Art,Hannah,217,35,5,"August 7, 2018","Don't think this graphic novel's absurdist, off-the-wall sense of humour would be for everyone, which is why I loved it. I chuckled a lot. The sense of humour reminded me a lot of SuperMutant Magic Academy, except with less of the nihilism and more metaphor and symbolism in this work. I do like that Davis is one of those artists that changes her medium and style throughout her graphic novels, but I do feel like the cover of this and the work in You & a Bike & a Road was more moving aesthetically to me than Why Art? Although this might just be down to personal tastes. ",4,N/A
35407505,Why Art,hweatherfield,69,8,5,"February 11, 2019","What a perfectly sized meta adventure through an artists' philosophy. Witty, emotional, simplistic, and just all around beautiful - Why Art? is a graphic masterpiece for artists and non-artists alike. Through surreal storytelling, Davis creatively brings us through a deep analysis of the many aspects of art and art-making, finally providing us with the answer by transcending what it means to be a human that creates. Its definitely a deeper read than it looks, and I was touched by it. Will be reading this again, probably many more times. Would recommend this to everyone, especially artists looking for more meaning to their process and the world around them.",4,N/A
35407505,Why Art,Diz,"1,506",84,4,"April 24, 2018","This is a bit bizarre. It's not really about art, but about how people relate to art and what it means in their lives. Also, it's about how the power of creation leads us to learn something about ourselves. It does get a bit abstract at times, so multiple readings are probably necessary to fully appreciate it. The way this book is written is more like a children's picture book for adults rather than as a comic, so there is a lot less text than in a typical comic. This makes it easy to do the multiple readings that are needed.",4,N/A

35407505,Why Art,Emilia P,"1,704",49,4,"August 9, 2018","YES ART.Eleanor Davis, this could be one of those throwaway sketchy businesses, but no, it celebrates and mocks and reveres and challenges the work of artists, and why we/anyone/she creates. Power, anger, need, instinct. A bit of a unexpected whirlwind in a slim little volume. I like Davis' outlook a lot, she brings her whole self to whatever she does, and I am happy to bring myself too. :) ",3,N/A
