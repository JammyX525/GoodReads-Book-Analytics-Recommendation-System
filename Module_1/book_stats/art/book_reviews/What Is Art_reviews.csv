127963,What Is Art,Glenn Russell,"1,325",11600,5,"December 12, 2021","Unlike many works of aesthetics which tend to be overly abstract and dense, using technical terms from philosophy and a layering of sophisticated concepts, Leo Tolstoy’s book is clear-cut, employing language and ideas anybody interested in the subject can understand.Tolstoy is passionate about art and art's place within human experience. For many years, he tells us, he has been observing art and reading about art. And what he sees and reads is not pretty. For instance, he goes to a rehearsal of opera: ""All is stopped, and the director, turning to the orchestra, attacks the French horn, scolding him in the rudest of terms, as cabmen abuse each other, for taking the wrong note."" Seen through Tolstoy's eyes, the entire production is a ridiculous, grotesque, overblown extravagance. We can imagine Tolstoy shaking his head when he observes, ""It would be difficult to find a more repulsive sight.""Tolstoy presents a detailed sampling of what philosophers and aestheticians have written about art and beauty throughout history, particularly since the eighteenth century, when aesthetics became a subject unto itself. The theories range from art being an expression of divine truth to art being a titillation of the senses of seeing, hearing, feeling and even tasting and smelling. Tolstoy notes toward the end of his study, ""Therefore, however strange it may seem to say so, in spite of the mountains of books written about art, no exact definition of art has been constructed. And the reason for this is that the conception of art has been based on the conception of beauty."" According to Tolstoy, we must investigate a better way to view art than linking art with beauty.Further on, Tolstoy gives us an example of a young art gallery-goer being baffled at the painting of the various modern schools of art, impressionism, post-impressionism and the like. Tolstoy empathizes with the gallery-goer and knows most other ordinary folk share this same reaction, as when he states: ""the majority of people who are in sympathy with me, do not understand the productions of the new art, simply because there is nothing in it to understand, and because it is bad art."" Why is this the case in the modern world? Tolstoy lays the blame on the artistic and spiritual fragmentation of a society divided by class, ""As soon as ever the art of the upper classes separated itself from universal art, a conviction arose that art may be art and yet be incomprehensible to the masses.""Tolstoy views the modern institutionalization of art with its professional artists and art critics supported by the upper class as the prime culprit responsible for a plethora of artworks that are degrading, meaningless and fake. He writes: ""Becoming ever poorer and poorer in subject-matter, and more and more unintelligible in form, the art of the upper classes, in its latest productions, has even lost all the characteristics of art, and has been replaced by imitations of art.""To compound the problem, Tolstoy tells us schools teaching art take mankind away from what is true in art, ""To produce such counterfeits, definite rules or recipes exist in each branch of art."" We come to see, with Tolstoy as our guide, how aspiring artists are given these counterfeits as models to follow and imitate; things have gone so far that creating art is reduced to ""acquiring the knack."" Anybody who is familiar with the way in which writing is taught in today's colleges and universities will see how exactly right Tolstoy is on this point - students are given a collection of essays written by modern writers in which to model their own writing.Tolstoy provides more examples of false, muddled, insincere, bad art. His description of an opera by Richard Wagner is laugh out loud funny. We read: ""This gnome, still opening his mouth in the same strange way, long continued to sing or shout."" Tolstoy hated going to the theater to see an opera or ballet. He predicts art forms like opera or ballet could never and will never be appreciated and enjoyed by the common person.Actually, on this point, he was off by a mile. Turns out, people who attend ballet nowadays can't get enough of productions like The Nutcracker. And talking about being off by a mile, Tolstoy judged Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as bad art since the work cannot be viewed as religious art nor does it unite people in one feeling; rather, he said, the fifth symphony is, ""long, confused, artificial"". Goodness! Most everyday Joe work-a-day type people who are concert-goers would be thrilled if Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was on the program. What else is bad art? Tolstoy writes: ""In painting we must similarly place in the class of bad art all the Church, patriotic, and exclusive pictures.""Well then, what does Tolstoy regard as good art? In a word, art that has three qualities: 1) clarity, 2) sincerity, and 3) individuality (as opposed to copying other art). And, in the author’s view, in order to be considered good art, the work must create authentic religious feelings and engender the brotherhood of man. As examples of good art, Tolstoy cites Dickens, Hugo, Dostoevsky and the painter Millet.You might not agree with Tolstoy on every point, but that is no reason to pass over a careful study of his views. After all, he is one of the world's great writers and knew a thing or two about art.",179,19
127963,What Is Art,Sue K H,349,60,5,"July 29, 2021","I rate this as 5 stars even though I disagree with much of it.  This book is guaranteed to get your bristles up. Well, maybe not yours, but my bristles surely were up.   Shun Beethoven?!  Shun Don Quixote?! Shun Shakespeare?! How dare he.  I didn't agree with much of what Tolstoy said for the 1st 3/4 of this.  I'm a Christian as he is, but I felt it too preachy and offputting until the end where he really brought it home and I could more fully understand where he was coming from.  I already want to re-read this with a less defensive posture, but I only read it as a suggested precursor to Anna Karenina, and I really want to get started on that.  By the end of this,  I understood that Tolstoy's focus had more to do with the inequity in how the upper classes transferred financial resources to certain kinds of arts and science that serve their own privileged pleasure, rather than to those that can improve the lives of everyone.  That is something I can wholeheartedly agree with, without agreeing on how to best improve the lives of everyone.  Some of my disagreements likely have to do with the difference in our times.  In his day, for example, opera (and other art forms) were mostly only enjoyed by the upper classes, while the peasants slaved over their production.   Now you can watch an opera in a movie theater or even stream one on your computer.  However, even though the workers are overall better off today, their pay is far from those of the producers or artists, and those who spend more time working still have less time for viewing, reading, or listening to art. I disagree more strongly with other parts that would take too much time to go into and could easily be misinterpreted  (as I too may be misinterpreting Tolstoy).  Even though I feel Tolstoy's position is extreme through the lens of my interpretation, I can tell that he has good intentions, which allows me to leave room for the possibility that his position is more nuanced than I've understood it.  What I do love, is that this work provides a lot of food for thought and the possibility that both of us can have some errors in our philosophy without making either of us evil.  Also, it makes a difference to view his ideas in the time he wrote them rather than through the perspective of our current time.   I give this 5 stars for its ability to make me dig deeper into my own beliefs and examine whether there are some holes in mine as well as in his.  ",18,6
127963,What Is Art,Ben,811,47,4,"May 25, 2015","Good works of art to Tolstoy: the works of Victor Hugo, the novels of Charles Dickens, some of the tales of Gogol and Pushkin, the writings of Maupassant, the comedies of Molière (whom Tolstoy refers to as ""the most excellent artist of modern times,"" according to this translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky), the writings of Dostoevsky, Schiller's Robbers, Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Adam Bede by George Eliot, Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, a handful of paintings by little known artists, folk music, and a few compositions by musicians such as Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Beethoven, Bach and Chopin, in addition to two of his own lesser known short stories (""God Sees the Truth"" and ""Prisoner of the Caucasus"") and the stories of the Bible and the tales about the Buddha.Bad works of ""art"" to Tolstoy (many of which he does not consider art at all -- more on this below): the works of Dante, the writings of Shakespeare, most of his own literary works (including his two masterpieces, War and Peace and Anna Karenina), most of the work of Beethoven, the writings of Goethe, the art of the French symbolists (especially Verlaine and Baudelaire), many of the later works of Pushkin, the writings of Oscar Wilde, the works of Michelangelo, the paintings of artists like Monet, and perhaps more than any other, the work of Richard Wagner. Oh, but wait, his disdain for Nietzsche may be greatest yet. So, what does Tolstoy consider ""art"" and what does he consider ""good art""? First, and perhaps most importantly, Tolstoy begins by rejecting the common argument by modern writers on the subject of aesthetics that the main purpose of art is to create works of beauty. He argues that many people think they know what art is, but when pressed we find that their definitions of art are based on taken for granted assumptions and they, in fact, are little able to defend their claims of what constitutes art. Contrary to the mainstream view, Tolstoy argues instead that art is something much broader than many so-called 'experts' in aesthetics would have us believe (including not just great paintings and novels, but short stories, sketches, jokes, lullabies, decor, etc.), and it begins whenever one creates something that expresses some feeling that the artist has based on his or her own experience (including his/her dreams, fears, wishes or aspirations). But this alone does not constitute ""art."" In addition to this, the artist's expression of his feeling must be ""infectious,"" which is to say that by being exposed to this work of art others (and the working majority in particular) must be affected by the artist's creation, for it speaks to some universal Truth. This is what, to Tolstoy constitutes art, and good art is that which speaks of a universal brotherhood, drawing on a Christian ethic (the same type of feeling that eases the unrest of some of Tolstoy's autobiographic characters like Pierre Bezukhov in War and Peace and Levin in Anna Karenina, the same type of feeling that infects Natasha in War and Peace when she hears traditional Russian folk music and decides to give up harp lessons in favor of the guitar), for art throughout history, he explains, is really an expression of religious consciousness. The art of the modern era, Tolstoy argues, has been intercepted by the nonbelievers of the upper-classes and by godless men led by Nietzsche, who create art (what he refers to as ""counterfeit art"" as opposed to genuine art) that claims to invent new styles, to promote some sort of beauty, etc., but which is really inaccessible to the great masses, who all the while toil in the service of this art. As evidence (questionable indeed) he points to his own inability to understand the works of the French symbolists or the operatic works of Wagner versus how moved he is (and as others he knows have been) by Russian folk songs and stories by common, unknown Russian working men. For works to be ""good art"" Tolstoy argues they must ""always be understood by everyone,"" and it matters little if the work is ""moral"" or ""immoral,"" so long as it is understandable and so long as the content is such that feelings of the artist are communicated to and correspond with the feelings of the audience. In terms of social class Tolstoy raises several compelling points, and this is where I think the great strength of this controversial work lies (in addition to the advancements he makes to the theory of art and the role of aesthetics in art theory), namely that the upper classes have created somewhat of a stranglehold on ""art."" The upper-classes use their money to finance works of art (and science too) which they agree with, or that infects them (though often which has the opposite effect on the majority, which has not only a difficult time understanding these works, but feeling them, for the experiences communicated are not universal but are often restricted to society's ruling class, who feel that they have important and diverse feelings, but who really only have three ""insignificant and uncomplicated feelings: the feelings of pride, sexual lust, and the tedium of living""). Tolstoy argues that for works to be good art they must be infectious not only for those in a certain class of society, but for the working majority, regardless of social class, religion, etc. I wondered as I read this what Tolstoy would make of many of the writers, painters and musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries. What would he think, for instance, of the democratic art of cinema? Or of popular music like rock and roll? The blues? It led me to hours of fun mental games wondering what Tolstoy would make of certain writers. One can imagine that he would reject most of the major visual artists of this period (including the Dadaists and Surrealists, the Cubists, the Abstract Expressionists, etc.), as well as the vast majority of Modernist writers (no art for art's sake for this fellow), the works of Postmodernists, etc. I wonder if he would consider Steinbeck a great artist. It seems plausible. What about the neorealist filmmakers? The blues and folk artists of today? Tolstoy's argument that genuine art is art that must be done for the purpose of the communication of authentic feelings, and not be done for monetary gain, makes consideration of what might be considered genuine art under his theory a bit more complicated. Genuine art should strive to be art that is unadorned, in no need of bells and whistles to communicate its essential Truth: Terrible as it may be to say it, what has happened to the art of our circle and time is the same as happens with a woman who sells her feminine attractions, destined for motherhood, for the pleasure of those who are tempted by such pleasures.The art of our time and circle has become a harlot. And this comparison holds true in the smallest details. It is, in the same way, not limited in time, is always fancy in dress, is always for sale; it is just as alluring and pernicious.The genuine work of art can manifest itself in an artist's soul only rarely, as a fruit of all his previous life, just as a child is conceived by its mother. Counterfeit art is produced by artisans and craftsmen continually, as long as there are consumers.Genuine art has no need for dressing up, like the wife of a loving husband. Counterfeit art, like a prostitute, must always be decked out.The cause of the appearance of genuine art is an inner need to express a stored-up feeling, as love is the cause of sexual conception for a mother. The cause of counterfeit art is mercenary, just as with prostitution. The consequence of true art is the introduction of a new feeling into everyday life, as the consequence of a wife's love is the birth of a new person into life. The consequence of counterfeit art is the corruption of man, the insatiability of pleasures, the weakness of man's spiritual force.This is what people of our time and circle must understand in order to get rid of the filthy stream of this depraved, lascivious art that is drowning us.This hilarious, lengthy excerpt is admittedly very cringe-inducing from a feminist perspective, but it sums up (with a few gaps) Tolstoy's view of modern art and also gives readers a general sense of the idea that art must take to be considered genuine and good art in accordance with his theory. Prophetic in many ways (such as in the final chapter where Tolstoy argues that sociology, really, should be the main focus of science, as science's main concern should, like art, be with improving the lots of humankind -- and animalkind for that matter --, but in which he argues that modern science instead will soon lead us to a state in which most of our food is produced in laboratories and in which the fleeting interests of the upper classes will be given scientific priority), Tolstoy's work is not without faults. Aside from being very antifeminist at times (forgivable in the sense that he was a product of his age), the work while broadening the understanding of what constitutes art on the one hand, narrows it on the other. The essay also downplays the audience's role in interpreting works of art, audience subjectivity being a major concern among media and literary theorists in more recent years (and I'm thinking particularly here of the newer works by theorists like Stuart Hall and Terry Eagleton). While Tolstoy criticizes those like Nietzsche for his disdain of the masses, Tolstoy less conspicuously (and I think unintentionally) shows a disdain for any (outside of the upper class circle) who are affected by the works of the artists he criticizes so harshly. And then, of course, the merits of the theory itself are debatable. I don't necessarily know that beauty, so very subjective, should be the sole determinant of whether or not something is considered art. But I also don't know that the infectiousness of a feeling is what makes a work art either. And contrary to Virginia Woolf's claim that women writers, in order to have the same chance at artistic success as men, need a certain amount of money and a room of their own (though I find her arguments faulty in the sense that she makes this argument considering gender while ignoring the effects of social class), Tolstoy argues that money is a corrupting force and that the artist of the future will create works of art whenever the feeling takes him/her, but will not earn a living through art, but rather through ""some kind of labour."" I side here more with Woolf, for without a little money, and thereby a little free time, it can be very difficult for one to find the means to create -- unless of course, as Marx argues in Volume 3 of Capital, pay should increase at the same time as working hours decrease. But Tolstoy opposes this insomuch as he feels more luxuries could corrupt the working people, just as luxuries have corrupted the upper classes of society. In addition to reading this work I recently watched the Orson Welles film essay F for Fake which deals with art forgery, and so I have been giving considerable thought to the topic recently (and this has also called to mind other art documentaries, such as Who the #$&% Is Jackson Pollock? and Banksy's Exit Through the Gift Shop. It took Tolstoy 15 years and much thought to organize his ideas which are presented in this work. It was a lofty undertaking and maybe he would have revised his ideas had he lived in this century. I don't know. It's a very interesting read, very representative of the turn in Tolstoy's writings after he had rejected his ambitions as a writer of fiction, and it asks a great many more questions than it answers. I don't know that I would call it ""essential"" Tolstoy, but I would suggest it as a must-read for any interested in the topic of art and aesthetics. So what is art? For me, it's subjective, and it includes much more than the guardians of the gates to the art world would have us believe. But is art only that which is beautiful? Only that which expresses the religious consciousness of the age? Only that which communicates feelings or some Truth of truths to others? Who's to say? Tolstoy's work, even if it has its flaws, filled in some gaps in existing theories on art. And it spurs readers to think critically about something we often take-for-granted: Art. ",14,5
127963,What Is Art,Thomas Rogers,15,1 follower,4,"May 10, 2020","I recently read this book on holiday in Austria.Fascinating!I am a Fine Art student attending Falmouth University Cornwall, going into my final year, and a devout follower of Jesus. Throughout the course of my degree I have constantly struggled to reconcile my beliefs, with fine art.Most of the time art seemed pretty pointless to me, it seemed completely self-indulgent, and a total waste of my time along with everybody else's - when considering the state of this world and the majority of it's inhabitants. I am so glad to have found such a friend in Tolstoy.I almost completely agree with everything covered in the book, and share his discontent with vague, vein, modern art. I, however, believe in people's freedom, to manufacture art regardless of it's ""goodness"", even still I wish that more and more creative people would be willing to endeavour to stand outside of Western individualism, pleasure, and art for arts sake; and begin to explore art that is oriented towards the progression and unification of mankind and our God; encompassing all realms of our salvation: physical, emotional, spiritual, political, economic, and social. I am confident that I will not pursue a career in the arts (as we know it) after my degree, as I am keen to throw myself into the direct service of the poor; but rather I desire that art runs through my life and we will meet along the way when we may.This kind of art excites me. This art that means so much more than beauty or pleasure. Why are we so afraid of it?",9,N/A

127963,What Is Art,Luisa,11,43,3,"April 24, 2018","Having never read Tolstoi before, this seemed like an interesting start since knowing his perspective about art in general would make me understand his own work better, especially his novels.This being said, I was clearly not ready for this book. The amount of research I had to do in order to understand his ideas about some writers, musicians, painters, sculptures, etc. (or at least know who he was talking about) was, at times, overwhelming, which made me fall behind on schedule to finish the book.Another negative aspect about it is the way he explains what he thinks about the topic: what he states is clearly biased by the time-frame he lived in, which was extremely different from the 21st century and that's maybe the reason why I didn't empathize with some of his arguments.Even though I am giving this book only 3 stars, it is still a very interesting reading since it not only shows Tolstoi's perspective about a very important topic, but also educates the reader about more artists of his time. I would say it is still worth it to read this book if you are interested in knowing more about art.",5,N/A

127963,What Is Art,"Leon ""The Kilted Scotsman"" McNair",95,5,5,"December 5, 2021","What Is Art?Leo Tolstoy's ability to dive into his philosophical tracts surrounding the subject and question of Art whilst staying the penmanship at a relatively easy read is very commendable. He tackles the question of what Art is in its purity, that what Art should mean between the artist and the audience - whether it be in the form of opera, libretto, musical composition, painting, dancing, or others - that can and should captivate emotions and in essence be infectious. By doing this, he therefore follows on with separating what pure Art is, from what it isn't. And from what Art isn't, he considers this the perversion of Art, the corrupted use to indulge in a man's senses. Tolstoy is therein very critical against the perversions of Art that are incomprehensible to him, in view of our senses: that they evoke nothing to our delight as onlookers nor cultivate the artist's longing expressions.What was Art in the Early Medieval times was what garnered everybody's attention for the greater good of the Self. Hence, Tolstoy illuminates on the Christian Art prevalent at this time, and that Christ as the figure all artists strived to make sense of their emotions, which in turn all onlookers strived to emulate in their character. He then juxtaposes this version of Art with the ""cultured man"" of his time, who, as the upper-class client that has commissioned an artist for their own pleasures, disrupts this inherent characteristic of Art because it no more resembles this altruistic or utilitarian motive in which the artist freely encapsulates with emotion, but rather of a selfish desire within the client. Moreover, Tolstoy is critical in his description of this perversion of Art produced by the ""cultured man"", director of a theatre play, or in ballet performances, with the effects of seduction and lust that was then, and even now, prevalent, through the use of near-naked or naked sensuality to habitually evoke raw and carnal vices, in what he and the aestheticians decidedly call Beauty - an attempt to accurately describe that which is deemed commonly aesthetically-pleasing in modest scientific terms.",4,N/A

Tolstoys main point is that the art that we see today (and in his time also) is on the whole very immitative and not true art. for him true is is when the artist feels something and wants to convey that through his work so that the person viewing it ""feels"" what the artist felt also. there are lots of other very challenging views in here which are very thought provoking. Some of my favourite bits: ""But among these works of various kinds of art there is one in a hundred thousand which is not simply a little better than the others, but differs from all the rest in the way a diamond differs from glass.""""In painting, such are all falsely religious and patriotic pictures, as well as pictures representing the amusements and delight s of exclusive, wealthy and idle living; and such are all so-called symbolic paintings, in which the very meaning of the symbol is accessible only to persons of a certain circle; and, chiefly, all paintings of sensual objects, all that outrageous female nudity which fills all exhibitions and galleries. To the same kind belongs almost all concert and operatic music of our time, beginning with Beethoven — Schumann, Berlioz, Liszt, Wagner — the content of which is accessible only to people who have cultivated in themselves a morbid nervous excitability aroused by this artificial and exceptionally complex music.""""People say it is terrible and pitiful to look at little acrobats putting their legs behind their necks, but it is no less pitiful to look at ten-year-old children giving concerts, and still more so to see ten-year-old children who know by heart the exceptions of Latin grammar . . . But it is not only that these people are crippled physically and mentally — they are also crippled morally, becoming incapable of anything that is really necessary for people.""""No situation is more harmful for artistic productivity than the situation of complete security and luxury in which artists usually live in our society.
