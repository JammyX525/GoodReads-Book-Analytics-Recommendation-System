449128,Alla Prima Everything I Know about Painting,Christine,227,2,5,"March 30, 2019","This is one of those books that will always present some new information no matter how many times one has read it. Richard Schmid is one of the truly great artists of our time and in this particular book he discusses so many of the aspects of painting that lends that certain touch of mastery that many artists seek. From perception, control, color, and even confidence, the reader is given suggestions, based on Schmid's experience, on how to achieve confidence in one's painting. I particularly liked his discussion about softening edges and lines (Chapter 6) to control the viewer's perception of the art work; this is a strategy that I have experienced in some of my art classes. This is an excellent book for anyone who seeks to improve their work or for that shot in the arm to get out the colors and brushes. It is a purchase that I am glad to have made and highly recommend it to anyone who loves, and enjoys, making art.",N/A,N/A
449128,Alla Prima Everything I Know about Painting,Christine Zook,15,6,5,"December 31, 2022","If you want to elevate your art, this book is a must. The artist covers every aspect of painting as he guides you through the fundamentals of making a good painting. I am not an oil painter, but can apply almost all of the good things Mr Schmid teaches to acrylics and watercolor. This is a very generous gift of instruction from one of the great painters of this past century.",N/A,N/A

449128,Alla Prima Everything I Know about Painting,Vikas,17,4,5,"August 20, 2021",A Must if you are into oils!!! Alla prima is simply painting what we see (in a single sitting) instep of painstakingly trying to depict subjects only according to their external forms we concentrate on capturing the effects played by light.It's a method that turned out to be one of the most liberating discoveries in the history of art after the Renaissance.He guids you to achieve that sweet spot in-between realisum and abstract.To achieve that illusion of details! Plus an awesome collection of his paintings!,N/A,N/A

449128,Alla Prima Everything I Know about Painting,Thomas Veil,1,1 follower,5,"October 9, 2009","This is the best painting book I've ever read, and it's without question a must read for painters interested in working Alla Prima (roughly translates to ""Painting from life in one sitting""). Schmid basically put his 50+ years of painting experience in this book - it will save any artist, even of other fields, a lot of time figuring those things out by themselves.First of all, Richard Schmid clearly applies what he is writing about: his paintings are amazing - both in expression and in technical brilliance. Since the prints in the book are very high quality, it is nice as art book by itself, but it also gives the content itself more weight.Secondly, what I appreciate a lot is that Schmid writes very down to earth. No magic tricks or spiritual mambo jumbo. This is about how to look at things the right way, and how to apply paint to a canvas to create beautiful art. This straight, nearly scientific approach leads to some surprises, especially when he talks about composition or color. He disenchants some often heard teachings. At the same time he never pretends to have any special key to art.I think this is all in all also very motivating - it shows you that you can reach anything on a canvas. You don't have to be born with a special talent, nor does it need magic: Just the right mindset, knowledge, and a lot of training.There are some points where I disagree with him, and there are parts that I have yet to fully grasp (color temperature is one of the toughest concepts for me). Yet I learned a lot, and every time I read some chapters again, I discover new gems.Well, if it hasn't been clear by now: I very much endorse this book :)",N/A,N/A
449128,Alla Prima Everything I Know about Painting,Todd,81,3,3,"April 11, 2009","Well, overall this is a decent painting book. I like some of the things the artist discusses, although i cannot agree with all of it(since a lot is just personal bravado and rhetoric used throughout)I appreciate his chapters on starting and direct painting, but have to say there are many better books out there for that subject.I don't mean that this is a bad book by any means, but if you are looking for something to teach you new things, or be a ground opener, this isn't it in my opinion.His chapter on composition is useless, as are most of his comments on lighting and using photographs....his explanations were just not relevant in my opinion.Again i would say read Loomis' ""eye of the painter"" to get everything the book above offers plus a lot of very helpful advice, and pointers.To me Schmid is pretty overrated, and i can see why that is, he is decently flashy, but without a lot of substance.-i think students might get a good idea of where to go from this book but should abandon it and get into more serious books soon after reading it.",2 comments,N/A
449128,Alla Prima Everything I Know about Painting,Mirian,24,8,5,"March 19, 2011","I just devoured this thing. Written by one of today's greatest oil painters - this is a must read, common sense, instructional tool for the representational artist.(March 2011) Upon rereading, I have to add a warning based on the fact Richard Schmid is an absolute genius: He spews good advice like a firehose. Mere mortals can't keep up. The result is a new ability to pick apart your artwork to a degree you were never aware of before. You can read his advice, you can say ""Ah-Ha!"" a million times, you will see with new eyes, you will have more confidence. Until... your past mistakes now appear brighter than the sun, you will hate every painting you ever did.Still a must-read. Still Five Stars.",N/A,N/A
