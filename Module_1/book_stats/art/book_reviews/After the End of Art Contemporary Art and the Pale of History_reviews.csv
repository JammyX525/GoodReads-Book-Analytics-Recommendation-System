137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,David Williamson,170,14,5,"September 16, 2011","Philosophers tend to make the worst art theorist and artists tend to make terrible philosophers (or at least when they try to put it into language). Danto on the other hand has actually read art theory and criticism, so does actually know what he is talking about.This book had been sitting on my shelf for quite awhile, as I had grown sick of art theory and especially art/aesthetics philosophy. After being encouraged to read this however, I have taken a great interest in Danto’s work on art and philosophy (even if he is influenced by Hegel!) and do wish I had read this while at University, as I tend to agree with the majority of it. Danto’s book would have given me more confidence to stand my ground against art tutors (as they can be quite mean at Goldsmiths!), as well as validating my own theory of each new art medium (film, video, installation, computer, internet) tending to imitate the Modernist doctrine, before being institutional accepted (ie by the Museums), as in the tedious art video’s in the 80s and 90s discarding narrative or anything cinematic for themes and scenario on time, space and light, etc. All in the name to be taken seriously!This book will also answer most people’s queries on why art is like it is, why it has any value and why it will never return to its old values, or at least not in its former guise of painting landscapes and pretty flowers.",13,N/A
137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,Peter Landau,866,44,5,"November 30, 2022","I don’t know about art, but I know when it’s dead. That’s not exactly what painter turned philosopher turned art critic Arthur C. Danto means in AFTER THE END OF ART: CONTEMPORARY ART AND THE PALE OF HISTORY. Art isn’t dead, but the historic narrative that we know of as art, what progressed over the last six hundred years or more, has come to an end. What’s next, according to Danto, is a philosophic art, more about ideas than materials. Just as the art before art, when it served a religious purpose, wasn’t art because it was defined as a means of faith. The art narrative that followed the sacred one ended, in Danto’s opinion, with the 1964 exhibition of Andy Warhol’s Brillo Boxes. Art was no longer visual in the sense that a trained eye could determine its value. There was no difference between Warhol’s Brillo Boxes and the boxes of Brillo lining the supermarket shelf. Art became about the question what is art? Even Duchamp, whose Fountain, a urinal signed and mounted on a museum wall, and considered a precursor to art as idea, is really more about aesthetics. The Pop artists and those that followed were untethered from the history of art and therefore no longer had to abide by the rules. Maybe that’s why some have such a hard time understanding contemporary art. It’s often cerebral or just chaotic, a movement without a center, coming at you from every direction and just as you think you’ve got a bead on it, another piece flies by from a different angle. It’s art, yes, but it’s not fully processed by the senses, as art in the past had been. Danto isn’t dismissive. He’s a fan of Warhol, and he highlights some artists who successfully make art after the end of art. A lot of them are making interesting work. Maybe I’m a traditionalist or conservative or just old-fashioned but I’m suspect of philosophy and its playground of the mind. While I can appreciate much contemporary art, it’s always the material-based works that rely less on ideas than lines that I follow. Ideas are great, but are they art? I don’t know. Ideas come and they go, but mostly they hide behind something, even words, and feel removed and distant. I’m not against ideas, but I think of art as more, as creative expression beyond ideas. Art is failure, while ideas tend to serve a purpose or an agenda. Not always, but more often than not. I prefer an expression beyond the artist’s reach than ends in defeat, not an idea that is obscured by its execution. Who is that speaking to? Museums, mostly, and collectors, galleries, the so-called “blue-chip” artists. Art has been a marketplace for a long time, but now ideas are making that market even more exclusive. I’m not rejecting contemporary art. That would be impossible. It’s too eclectic. There’s something for everyone. Perhaps it’s best to give up narratives, which like history are just a construct that has little to do with reality. The end of art is only just a little over 50 years old. We’re likely in a transitional period or we’ve landed somewhere else as yet undiscovered. Who knows, until the insightful mind of a future Danto comes to map it, because art appears closer in the rearview mirror.",6,N/A
137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,Jana,62,23,3,"January 26, 2008","I wouldn't say I ""liked it,"" but it merits 3 stars because the ideas (though dated) are relevant for artists (as a record of what kind of muck we've since climbed out of). I continue to have difficulty with this sort of application of theory because it lends itself so easily to the purposes of those who spout fundamentalist dogma... what with the Puritanical fear of ""pleasure"" and a long list of dos and don'ts for artists. I saw so many artists stifled because they came to art through theory (rather than applying theory to art), which turned me off all theory for a time. That, and this sort of thinking was paralyzing my own art practice. ",4,N/A
137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,JabJo,44,1 follower,3,"July 6, 2017","Reading this book was like having an enjoyable late night coffee with a friend, back-and-forthing about art till the wee hours. Mind you, a friend with a pretty elevated philosophical vocabulary; but still, it didn’t feel didactic, dogmatic, or even argumentative. The author offers his opinions and explains his reasoning, the idea being that it’s not really art that’s dead, but that there’s been a big change in how we see and what we define as art. Context and the historical/cultural point of view make all the difference. A good example would be the chapter on ‘monochrome’ art: various artists who have painted a square canvas in one solid colour--and there have been quite a few over different periods in art. But because they’ve done it for very different reasons, you can’t define the square monochromes as one single style, any more than a skinny-man Giacometti sculpture isn’t in the same category as a skinny-man tribal African sculpture. The first couple of chapters are a bit of a slog and often a bit repetitious—he explains his idea, then keeps rephrasing it (Ok, I got it the first time!) and I didn’t know if I’d keep on, but he warms up as he goes, illustrating his ideas with examples and interesting personal speculations. It always felt as though he would be interested to hear other people's ideas. In the end, I really did feel as if I’d had a good conversation with an art-loving friend.",2,N/A

137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,Gastjäle,339,38,5,"May 15, 2020","When I read about Hegel's brilliant though cruelly rigid aesthetic philosophy, I was convinced that art needs to be defined somehow - otherwise it would be an empty concept for lazy thinkers. But now that I've read this fabulous work by Danto, I hesitate in my thoughts. Obviously, I still think that there's no use of a concept that's not exclusive, yet there are other things to be taken into consideration here: what is to be excluded and based on which criteria? Like other works on aesthetics (I think the term applies in this case as well, even though Danto preferred the term ""art criticism"" in its stead), After the End of Art is ultimately based on the author's feeling of what is art. What's striking about Danto is that the work is not based on the feeling of what art is not. In contradistinction to, for instance, Hegel's sweeping systematicism, Ruskin's poetry and Bell's somewhat fanatic manifestos, Danto appears as a thoughtful, critical and considerate philosopher/art critic, who manages to temper his emotional appreciation of art with careful analysis. And like a post-modern philosopher, he no longer sees that he is working alone, but rather he's but part of the great canon of the history of thinking, and he is not loth to have recourse to other's help and ideas. It is an unqualified pleasure to read something that feels so genuinely open-minded yet calculating - a rara avis in sooth! But the great problem here is that Danto doesn't provide any satisfactory definition for art; he merely wants to enfranchise it and let it thrive as multiform as possible. By proclaiming the end of master narratives and manifestos in art and thus letting it branch out where it list, he definitely appears more of an appreciator of art than the likes of Bell, but at the same time I see another problem incoming: another problem of discernment. That is: how to differentiate between a dishonest parody and a bona fide work of art? Danto himself would probably have recourse to art criticism, which would in turn sleuth into the life of the artist in question and bring the required information to light, but in this there are at least two difficulties: 1) what is the kind of information that is required in order to pronounce something art and 2) even the fact that the eye of the most refined dilettante cannot discern the genuineness of an artwork is bound to diminish the importance/credibility of art in the eyes of the public. Contemporary art becomes a joke, it becomes something so obviously ludicrous that it either gives rise to wry smiles of amusement (a mere superficial reaction) or incredulous snorts of derision - derision that hasn't got one ounce of profundity in it; it is simply disillusionment mixed with boredom. The public perspective crept into my review quite insidiously, but it was also treated at length in Danto's book. It was pointed out that, following the ideas of Warhol, anyone could be an artist and anything could be art - with the emphasis on the modal auxiliary verb. I think there's a slight discrepancy between Danto's idea of enfranchisement and his espousing of art criticism as the main means to understand contemporary art: the moment the underlying ideas of such a theory on art are revealed, the less an interesting thing it becomes to figure out the extra-perceptual matters of artworks - in fact, it becomes merely the pastime of the dilettantes. In addition, I think that underscoring the philosophical dimensions of contemporary art (i.e. it concentrating on commenting on what art is) seems to treat the topic as an endless well of fascination instead of a philosophical problem to be solved - many is the time when I've heard gallery-goers smile and go: ""Oh yeah, that could be art too! Very interesting."" That's simply novelty, it has nothing to do with philosophical inquiry. Now, I really like the idea that art is much more variegated than it was back in the age of narratives. But I abhor the idea of art becoming a hazy commentary on itself, or something that actually insists on fixing the experiencer's attention to extra-artistic things instead of the work in question. That kind of setting, in my opinion, inevitably leads to an endless series of ARTIST: ""What ho! Here's some art, as well!""CRITICS: ""Righto!""PUBLIC: ""Righto!""ARTIST: ""Righto!"",with plenty of works that seek to address different political issues, without figuring out whether such things could also be done in print instead. But! plenty of what Danto points out here is endlessly fascinating and inspiring. Though I dislike the intimation that art criticism would be a way to figure out whether something is art or not (in fact, it's preposterous and, like the institutional theory on art seems to do, merely hedges the actual definition of art), the way he laid out the purpose of art criticism is eye-opening: the critics can point out things which the eye cannot see, in addition to the things an inexperienced peeper probably cannot zoom in on. If any of this information manages to personally deepen my understanding of a work of art, I'll gladly accept it. Before reading this work, I kind of thought art criticism a nice extra at best, an unholy intrusion on my perceptive abilities at worst, but now I'm glad to accept, that there are some extra-perceptual dimension to art that are very valuable. After all, like Danto often points out, there is no art without history and thus the historical context which has the use of the artistic expression, not simply the manner that can be employed post facto.The idea of the Artworld is something I'm willing to underwrite without hesitation. Works of art are always connected to each other, and modify each other in turn. This seems like a truism in terms of chronological perspective, but what really struck me was the fact that newer works also, legitimately, affect the older. I wasn't quite sure how I should react when reading older works and thinking in terms of the new ones; I felt like it was wrong - yet this ingenious idea of the Artworld actually gave me courage to open the gates and let the modern spirit in, to see what kind of havoc/pleasure it yields. Another good point of the Artworld is that each work of art does not modify the others in a fixed manner: classics, for example, do so with more power than fresh works. This, of course, leads to another set of questions, but in principle is rings true to me. Ultimately, the fineness of the idea comes from the vertiginous realisation of the interconnectedness of human artistry - with no permission asked from the artist. (The whole concept has a whiff of Hegelian idealism in it, but I'm glad to accept it as a poetic idea, not as an idea proper.) Another great point was how Danto pointed out the importance of the place and theme of exhibition. It truly does affect the way anything is viewed or experienced. The theme of the exhibition, the concert setlist, the bands in the bill... they all intimate how the organisers want you to think of certain works of art or at least how they think about them. This might not be a grand revelation for many, but I feel I've always left that avenue of discovery untrodden. ***So, in the end, this book was an eye-opener. In a more profound way than I could express in a GR review at the moment - or ever. It was intellectually frustrating and awe-inspiring at the same time, and it raised some essential points in aesthetics like no other word has done in my personal experience. And not least of all, it offered countless anecdotes and examples about art (especially contemporary art), which were a thrill to read. You got my fiver in a flash, D!",N/A,N/A
137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,Michael,312,21,5,"November 14, 2007","As I recall, a great book despite my predilection to not really give a crap about some deep, brooding, probing interrogation about a freakin' Rothko painting or, God forbid, yet another Calder sculpture. Perhaps my disinterest is due to my status as redneck...or perhaps, as Danto's writing speculates, it's because of the destruction of some type of ""master narrative"" that essentially provides(ed) certain, unnamed boundaries within which to evaluate ""art"". Interestingly, he eschews a common formula of Warhol+Brillo Boxes = end of art tradition (nor even Duchamp's urinal), by personally choosing some Lichenstein comic strip-cum-painting published in a mid-fifties art journal. Whatever the case, he makes a compelling ""narrative"" for how art is now basically in a vacuum, only occasionally grounded by whatever socio-politico statement it may wish to proffer or, more often, a work simply relies on the Clement Greenburg criticized ""far-out"" aspect. My enthusiasm likely rests with the fact that most art, say, post-cubism or post-mid-Mondrian has usually failed to elicit in me anything beyond museum fatigue, and here, Danto constructs an argument that appeared to parallel and/or support my nausea with all of this flag-in-the-toilet and paper-mached-sidewalk-cow jazz.

137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,James Henderson,"1,981",166,3,"March 16, 2013","This is where Danto discusses his version of Hegel's ""end of art"" thesis. He first enunciated the thesis in a 1984 essay called ""The End of Art"", and developed it more recently in this work. To explain this thesis it may help first to say what Danto does not mean by it. He is not claiming that no-one is making art anymore; nor is he claiming that no good art is being made any more. But he thinks that a certain history of western art has come to an end, in about the way that Hegel suggested it would. He summarizes that history as follows:""...the master narrative of the history of art--in the West but by the end not in the West alone--is that there is an era of imitation, followed by an era of ideology, followed by our post-historical era in which, with qualification, anything goes.. . .In our narrative, at first only mimesis [imitation] was art, then several things were art but each tried to extinguish its competitors, and then, finally, it became apparent that there were no stylistic or philosophical constraints. There is no special way works of art have to be. And that is the present and, I should say, the final moment in the master narrative. It is the end of the story"" (AEA p.47).",1 like,N/A
137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,E. C. Koch,347,18,4,"July 28, 2015","I first ran into Danto when writing my thesis on post-modern film and have returned to him as a supplement to Gaddis' JR and The Recogniitons in hopes of finding answers to some of the questions Gaddis raises about art in those novels. And that search has been both successful and not. Danto's grand concept here is that art (he means paintings mostly) follows an historical narrative which is carried along by culture, and that, with the advent of Warhol, art reached the end of that narrative. So we're now (now being 1995) in what he calls the post-historical art period (what I would have called post-modernism) but that all that's left to arise is the next grand narrative. What constitutes art is a far trickier nut to crack (and is the crux on my current line of questioning about art which got me here in the first place), and the answer Danto provides is that it depends on context and the intentions of the artist (with a lot of clarification in between). Overall, I thought this was insightful and illuminating (if the slightest bit dated, and even if he very infrequently mentioned lit. or film) and makes a great follow-up to The Recognitions.",1 like,N/A

137933,After the End of Art Contemporary Art and the Pale of History,Andrew Noselli,357,1 follower,3,"October 18, 2022","This was read simultaneously with Irving Babbitt's ""Rousseau and Romanticism"", in which the author maintained a similar position to that of Danto, namely, that art and thought both collapsed as bankrupt human enterprises after Descartes. In this book Mr. Danto relates to his reader more as an academic editorialist rather than as a philosopher, and I am curious as to the contents of his other books, desiring to see if they are more philosophical in their approach; he does a lot of hand-holding in this book for the non-academic peruser of his pages, which were based on the A.W. Mellon series of lectures he was asked to give in the late 1990s. Nevertheless, I did get some clues as to the historical forces that make up the constricted position of art in the postmodern age, which used to be one of my favorite things to think through and philosophize about. After reading this book, my bottom down concluding opinion is that, if art no longer exists, if the working artist no longer a tenable occupation because of the breakdown of the ideological consciousness of the bicameral mind, this is because power has become decentralized in the current state of world affairs, as well as the fact that the status of art history has shifted from what was traditionally an archeology of the past into a machine-like apparatus for forecasting future probabilities due to the politics of money, entertainment and the philosophy of the self, which places importance on the present moment to such a degree that the fact that consciousness restricts itself to a fluctuating state is lost sight of. Danto frequently quotes from Heidegger, Nietzsche and Clement Greenberg in these pages; I found myself wishing he would allow his own voice, like that of an American Baudrillard, to rise to the surface and adumbrate his text with philosophical apostrophes of his own.

It is a bit redundant but, as it was originally a lecture, that sort of thing is to be expected. The ""End of Art"" thesis is a bit hokey but also a handy way to explain the plurality of art after Pop. Also, Danto's Hegelian view of art history is surprisingly brilliant.
