Even saying that, there are still some great stories in this collection. I thought ‘the Blue Aspic, the ‘Epiplectic Bicycle’ and the ‘Sopping Thursday’ were great stories. There were also several stories in here that didn’t work for me. There were a few other stories too. I still want to add this book to my collection someday. There are better places to start than this one though. ",15,2

51245,Amphigorey Also,Anthony Vacca,423,277,4,"June 25, 2014","Almost as top-notch a collection as Amphigorey and Amphigorey Too, and better than his final, posthumous collection, Amphigorey Again. There’s no knack for word wizardry nor elan for illustration that I haven’t already praised and expounded upon in the previous reviews for Gorey's work linked above. As always, Gorey's art is a heady delight for the eyes, ears and mind, and in this collection I unabashedly adored The Loathsome Couple, was happily horrified by The Stupid Joke, couldn't help but be cheerfully creeped out by The Prune People, and feel impelled to inform you that  The Awdrey-Gore Legacy is a must-see metafictional chef d'oeuvre. As satisfied as I am with my Gorey reading experience, I am also slightly crestfallen…now I have no more Gorey compilations to read! Sob.",10,N/A

51245,Amphigorey Also,Brigid ✩,581,1819,4,"August 18, 2016","I haven't read all the Amphigorey books (not that the order of them matters), but this one happened to be sitting around in my grandma's house, so ... I sat down and read the whole thing, which didn't take long. Edward Gorey has always been one of my favorite illustrators, and I love his dark sense of humor. There were a couple stories in this anthology that I found a little ... over-the-top (particularly a really disturbing one about a couple who murder children––yikes) but for the most part I really enjoyed it, and I'll have to check out the other books in the series.

Not only is his art gripping, hilarious, inexplicable, and just a little creepy in a schadenfreude sort of way, but the terse, lean writing is perfect. What a pleasure. Why did it take me so long to read this? ",4,N/A
51245,Amphigorey Also,Laura,434,16,4,"June 12, 2022","This one has my favorite cover of the Amphigoreys. Many excellent stories. I read “the Blue Aspic”, a story about an opera singer and her obsessive fan, the same day that I attended the opera for the first time in my life. The story reminded me of the movie Perfect Blue, which is also about an obsessive fan and a star. Both have Blue in the title! In this collection we really see an East Asian influence on Gorey’s art. This was prevalent in the other volumes too but I really noticed it here. I especially loved Less Passementeries Horribles. The series is just pictures of people being stalked by giant Omamori tassels and Hanamusubi knots that ominously float over them, ghostlike. Literally genius. I have a few of these tassel/amulets and associate them with a feeling of security, because I bought them at a shrine to provide protection. It tickled me to see that inverted here, the knots are a potentially dangerous specter. This volume had way more color stories than the other two! And so many bicycles! Another standout was the Awdrey Gore Legacy. First of all I loved the fictional pulp novel covers he drew on the title page. I realized that Gorey did the covers for a couple books I own and I’ll def be on the lookout for more. This story is not a story at all, it is just presenting the evidence of a murder mystery and you can peruse it at your leisure. Maps, objects, suspect profiles, fragments of notes. Unlike the other collections, and unlike most stories, we actually end on a triumphant note. The Tuning Fork seems like another one of Gorey’s typical stories where a child is horribly abused and then the kid either dies or the story ends abruptly in an unsettling manner. This time the little girl attempts suicide but is saved by a sea monster, who then helps her enact revenge on her cruel family. I loved the dark water in the illustrations. I think this is the best volume overall even though nothing has made me laugh as hard as the Hapless Child.",3,N/A
51245,Amphigorey Also,Kay,"1,004",172,5,"December 21, 2021","Just the other day I realized, by dint of perusing my Amazon wish list and noting its absence, that someone was giving me Amphigorey Again (#4) for Christmas. Well, someone gave me Amphigorey #3 last Christmas and somehow I had never read it. Incomprehensible, but true. I have the first two volumes as well, of course, and it's impossible to say which I like best, but this one is a strong contender. There are no less than three of Gorey's alphabetically-themed collections: ""The Utter Zoo,"" ""The Eclectic Abecedarium,"" and my favorite, ""The Glorious Nosebleed,"" which has nothing to do with nosebleeds but instead riffs on twenty-six adverbs in alphabetical order. (""He disposed of the fragments Slyly,"" ""She ran out of the room Tearfully,"" ""He explained himself Unconvincingly,"" and so on.) Any opera fan will guffaw appreciatively at ""The Blue Aspic,"" which traces the rise and downfall of one Ortenzia Caviglia, whose career takes off when someone (presumably Ortenzia's fan Jasper Ankle) sends a box of poisoned candied violets to the principal soprano, thus giving Ortenzia a chance to go on in her place. Another of Ortenzia's rivals, her manager, and a wealthy suitor all mysteriously die, presumably at the hands Jasper, though in typical Gorey fashion it's only obliquely inferred. But the entry that gave me the greatest pleasure was ""The Awdrey-Gore Legacy,"" a send-up of mystery writers such as Agatha Christie. (Here as elsewhere Gorey delighted in using anagrams of his name.) I will quote the beginning:Introductory note by E.G. DeadworryOn last St. Spasmus's day Miss D. Awdrey-Gore was found dead at the age of 97. Just before dawn a nameless poacher came upon her body in a disused fountain on the estate of Lord Ravelflap; she was seated bolt upright on a gilt ballroom chair, one of a set of seventeen then on display at Suthick & Upter's Auction Rooms in Market Footling; her left hand clutched a painted tin lily of cottage manufacture, inside which was rolled up a Cad's Relish label of a design superseded in 1947; something illegible was pencilled on the back. That she had been murdered was obvious, though as yet the cause of death has not been determined.""Exactly what the Awdrey-Gore Legacy is is beyond my powers of description, but I will just say that any fan of classic British detective fiction will be greatly amused. Plus, of course, there are all the drawings, which are at least as droll and inexplicable as the titles, couplets, and stories, if not moreso.",3,2
51245,Amphigorey Also,Kaethe,"6,327",451,4,"March 9, 2019","Less fun than the first and second collections less nonsense and limericks. Mostly I think of Gorey's characters as people-to-whom-things-happen, and of course, they read like characters from Victorian and Edwardian novels. I love The Utter Zoo and the little butterfly-doggy creatures and Bruno from The Sopping Thursday and the sweater-sporting dogs of L'Heure Bleu. The Awdry-Gore Legacy is spot-on. But The Loathsome Couple is too much like true crime books, which I avoid these days. It is literally dark with so much densely-drawn settings. I understand why I don't know these as well as those collected in the first two. I might very well not have read this since getting it.What I want now is Categor y. Love those cheerful little cat faces.Personal copy",3,N/A

51245,Amphigorey Also,Punk,"1,495",235,4,"June 20, 2012","A collection of some of Gorey's lesser known works. Gorey, of course, being known for his dark humor, whimsy, and incredibly detailed pen and ink crosshatching. Let me attempt to describe these for you.The Utter Zoo - Alphabet filled with fantastic creatures and rhymes. I love that he only shows about half the creatures. That is, not all of them are shown, and many are only half visible. That's one of the best things about Gorey's art; he only shows as much as you need to see.The Blue Aspic - Fan stalks an opera singer; interesting juxtaposition of their fortunes.The Epiplectic Bicycle - Brother and sister take an odd bicycle trip. I love the bicycle, how its feelings seem to be indicated by the direction of its handlebars.The Sopping Thursday - Has the character of a foreign phrase book on the subject of umbrellas. I like how disjointed it is, but still comes together in the end. Gorey draws the best umbrellas.The Grand Passion - The same, only more so. Does not come together in the end. ""Englished anonymously from the Conton Dialect.""La Passementeries Horribles - Hilarious illustrations of people and animals being menaced by giant tassels, galloons, and fringes.The Eclectic Abecedarium - Tiny alphabet, the pictures mere thumbnails, with rhymes.La Heure Blue - More phrase books, features two dogs in matching tennis sweaters who appear to be having the kind of conversation that only makes sense to couples.The Broken Spoke - Bicycles & bicycle-related memorabilia.The Awdrey-Gore Legacy - Characters, murder weapons, and locations for an unwritten mystery novel.The Glorious Nosebleed - An alphabet of adverbs, some with puns.The Loathsome Couple - A couple who murders children. Darker than Gorey's usual works because it comes right out and says what it's about instead of just implying it horribly.The Green Beads - Short and pointless, and that's saying something. I didn't get anything out of this at all.Les Urnes Utiles - A collection of different urns. See, this is also pointless, but sublime.The Stupid Joke - Reminiscent of Shel Silverstein, rhyming story about a kid who decides to stay in bed all day.The Prune People - People with...featureless prunes for heads...engaged in a variety of activities.The Tuning Fork - Cautionary tale? The tuning fork is seen briefly on the table and has no impact on the story; adore the last frame with the expired bathtub.Seeing so much of Gorey's work in one place let me pick out his habit of including a white parallelogram in every story. It really sticks out on the black backgrounds, but is more subtle on the white or grey ones, often looking like a business card lying on the ground.Four stars. The book itself has no page numbers or index, and no dates for the works, but it's still a great collection because I never would have bought any of these titles individually. If you're looking to get into Gorey, though, I'd recommend the first collection, Amphigorey, because those pieces have stronger narratives and will let you get accustomed to Gorey's style and sense of humor.

51245,Amphigorey Also,James,395,3,5,"September 20, 2015","As a child, I was exposed to Mr. Gorey through the animated introduction of Mystery as hosted by Vincent Price, I believe. While Mystery made me a lifelong fan of Price from youth, it would be sometime before I would ""rediscover"" Gorey and make the connection. Still, the imagery stuck with me and when I did notice a poster with similar art many years later, I sought out the artist and thus my interest was born. This collection might not be of Gorey's most famous works, but it is none the worse for having some lesser known works in it. His artwork is, as always,compelling and his stories strike the chord of a compelling adult based Seuss at time and border on something perhaps more dour at others. That being said, the joining of the the art and the words are almost symphonic and, if there is the rare missed note in this collection, it is not one I have found or at the least, the experience was so compelling it caused me to forgive it.Pick up Gorey's work - this one or any other - and read it, let it settle, then read the work again. The more Iraqi e the art, the more I appreciate the blending of word and art in this work. A great read for a dark, rainy day...or any other day for that matter, but atmosphere helps....",1 like,N/A
51245,Amphigorey Also,Victoria Moore,294,3,5,"January 22, 2016"," ""Amphigorey Also"" by Edward Gorey is an eccentric visual slice of fantasy created by a prolific illustrator and quixotic writer who definitely knows how to bring out one's inner child. Rendered in black and white gothic glamour I particularly admired ""The Letter Zoo Alphabet"" and the way Gorey matched the rhyming nonsense text with the illustrations. It would be a wonderful story to read to children who are learning the alphabet and their letters. Two of the most gothic and elegant tales, ""The Blue Aspic"" and ""The Loathsome Couple"" touched on insanity, murder and obsession that I found dark and disturbing but still gripping enough to read twice in a row. Alternately nightmarish and favorable the nostalgic way Gorey depicted his ""characters"" also reminded me of ""Steampunk Fashion"" and ""Victoriana"". This was shown most effectively in the picture tale ""Les Passementeries Horribles"" where various types of passementerie trims become nefarious objects that stalk and threaten their prey. Taut, with the suspense of a well-timed mystery, ""Amphigorey Also"" is a lively literary romp I enjoyed for its aesthetic and pictorial assets.",1 like,N/A
51245,Amphigorey Also,Elizabeth (Miss Eliza),"2,196",138,4,"June 23, 2019","Again, very uneven, but the five star stories might be some of my favorites, so the lesser ones are of no significance to the greatness of this book. The Awdrey-Gore Legacy is a new favorite for it's Agatha Christie multi-leveled parody. From mining Christie's own life to her tropes to her vook covers it was sheer genius. Also Les Urnes Utiles is just a great story that Gorey obviously did just to amuse himself and that's why I love it.

Edward Gorey was one of those very talented limerick writers. But, (imho) this collection of stories is rather haunting and ominous. Where is the amusing poetry? The sharp verse? Someone missed the boat. I think it was me. ",1 like,N/A
