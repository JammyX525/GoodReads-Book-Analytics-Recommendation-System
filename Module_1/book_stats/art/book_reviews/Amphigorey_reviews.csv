47559,Amphigorey,Lori,353,417,5,"July 3, 2020","It's hard to convey the joy I get from looking at almost all of Edward Gorey's work; I love it so. Whether you adore ""The Unstrung Harp"" or detest ""The Gashleycrumb Tinies,"" If you're famliar with his work and love, like, dislike or hate it, you can skip this review. It won't hurt my feelings, and anyway I wouldn't know. But there are laughs to be had here and if you're new to him or adore him or want a refresher, there is thoughtful amusement, silliness and so much more in the four anthologies of which Amphigorey is first. Gorey was a writer and illustrator who mainly created short works full of dark humor, deftly drawn in black-and-white panels, occasionally color. Words are perfectly married to the panels. In each panel something is off, sometimes a few things. A character has feet that are backward or looks like no creature we've seen before. A house, like that in ""The West Wing,"" has panel after panel of rooms that are increasingly bizarre. He disliked the term ""gothic"" applied to his work but it is, and often with a Victorian sensibility. His sense of humor was wry and droll and generally dark. His graphic short novels are not all simplistic and sometimes the reader has to work things out.He also did drawings for others' work, including illustrating John Updike's ""Twelve Terrors of Christmas."" He published some things under anagrams of his name. I mention this because like his body of work, this fun fact entertains my Nabokov-loving heart. Pen names included Dogear Wryde and Ms. Regera Dowdy. The guy was weird and I love weird.Amphigorey is a gem for fans of Gorey. One sheltered-in-place day I ordered all four anthologies at once to cheer myself up (morbid, yes, and so cheering). I do wish I'd read them last to first because Amphigorey is his Best Of and it's like starting with dessert.Here's a taste of his prose from ""The Unstrung Harp,"" one of my favorite of his books, which opens Amphigorey. It's the tale of novelist C(lavius) F(rederick) Earbrass, whose prior work includes the successful ""The Truffle Plantation"" and ""More Chains Than Clank,"" and who is now struggling to finish the novel ""The Unstrung Harp"" or TUH, as he refers to it, pondering, pondering, wherever he is. From a panel in which he's in the bath: ""Several weeks later, the loofah trickling on his knees, Mr. Earbrass mulls over an awkward retrospective bit that ought to go in Chapter II. But where? Even the voice of the omniscient author can hardly afford to interject a seemingly pointless anecdote concerning Ladderback in Tibet when the other characters are feverishly engaged in wondering whether to have the pond at Disshiver Cottage dragged."" Part of another panel:""Mr. Earbrass has finished Chapter VII, and it is obvious that before plunging ahead himself he has got to decide where the plot has to go and what will happen to it on arrival. He is engaged in making diagrams of possible routes and destinations, and wishing he had not dealt so summarily with Lirp, who would have been useful for taking retributive measures at the end of Part Three..."" Throughout Gorey's works children appear, generally in dire circumstances. He claimed not to like children and that's fairly obvious. These are with few exceptions not for kids and those ought to be purchased separately. His most famous book is ""The Gashleycrumb Tinies,"" a satire of alphabet primers using children's names and...it's easily searchable on the web. I don't dislike it, I don't adore it but there are those for whom it may be a bridge too far. Gorey insisted he was asexual and there's no evidence to the contrary. Another of my favorite books included here is ""The Curious Sofa: a pornographic work by Ogdred Weary"" (the pen name another anagram of Edward Gorey). It's not overtly racy but it's bizarre and hilarious. An increasingly large group of people gather for entertainments which are described and hinted at in PG-rated language and drawings. But in one panel he writes:""That evening in the library, Scylla, one of the guests who had certain anatomical peculiarities, demonstrated 'The Lithuanian Typewriter, assisted by Ronald and Robert..."" That's a brainworm for me, The LIthuanian Typewriter, silly as it is.I take such delight in Gorey, I know I will read this again and again. The other three anthologies will be savored on days when I most need a lift. And if a day comes when the EMTs must take me to the ICU with covid-19, I will grab my Goreys and demand they go with. Possibly in the back of the ambulance I'll still be laughing at The Lithuanian Typewriter...It's all nonsense. Which is how Edward Gorey usually described his work: ""Nonsense."" Marvelous, internally coherent and FUN -- and if it's nonsense, it's nonsense that delights, stimulates and tickles. I never want to be so serious that there's no place for that on my shelves and in my brain.",79,17
47559,Amphigorey,Calista,"3,791",31200,5,"May 4, 2018","A Collection of Edward Gorey’s 1st 15 tales that are mostly out of print. This is the best way to be able to read Edward Gorey now. His first story was 1953 and the last in the collection was 1965. The artwork holds this collection together, but for the most part there is nothing that pulls them together accept Edward’s dark sense of humor. I can only imagine that during the 50s this would have been a fresh air of variety and something a bit different. I have no idea how this man got published in the 50s accept he was so good. This is a fantastic collection of stories, probably more for the mature reader. The artwork is stunning. The story was a surprise and a delight if you can be delighted by a dark twist. There are 4 of these collections. Eventually, I will read them all. ",37,2
47559,Amphigorey,Anthony Vacca,423,277,5,"June 8, 2014","Filled with even more violent child deaths than its successor, Amphigorey Too, this collection of fifteen of Gorey’s earliest works is a catafalque of morbid delights. Beginning with Gorey’s debut, the metafictional masterpiece, The Unstrung Harp, the reader is lead down a surreal path of the playfully grotesque. Insects make sacrifices to their vicious gods, an anthropomorphic houseguest makes a nuance of itself, guests at an orgy bear witness to the horrors of a sofa modified into an infernal device, a threesome of fops make a doomed expedition on a handcar, the alphabet is learned at the expense of twenty-six children and, in general, the many eccentrically named characters that populate Gorey’s world are fated with brief lives that only in end in uncertainty and terror. Gorey’s gothic sensibilities, Victorian settings, and art deco caricatures are already realized here at the start of his career. Nothing but a pleasure to read, I am sad there are only two other collections left for me to pour over and that Gorey never wrote in a lengthier prose format. His knack for rhythm and diction is to be admired and should be studied by anyone who wants to learn a thing or three about how to craft a sentence with gusto and panache. ",28,N/A

47559,Amphigorey,Florencia,649,1876,5,"January 27, 2018","I loved this book! This is a collection of fifteen stories and drawings. Gorey's artwork is stunning. And his twisted, creepy sense of humor is just my cup of tea (not everyone's cup, I know). It can be dark but funny at the same time. It's not about some silly, creepy stories, there's a dark reality here that can be found outside this book. So, if this is too twisted and horrifying for you, can you survive watching the late night news?My first Gorey was The Gashlycrumb Tinies (review here). And I just immediately connected with this weird little man. Most of the times, there's a lesson to be learned in these stories. So, it's weird but also hmm... educational.Nov 30, 13* Also on my blog.",16,N/A

In the 80's, in college, were often around people who thought it was Incredibly funny and good and artistic and creative and whole shows put on with/of/about it all and so on. I was unmoved. Unlike 'wild-and-crazy-guys' (different story), in this case, even when I was the right age it just wasn't my cup of tea. I get why it's great and all, but like Coen Bros' films, my reaction is not something I can control, it's just adjacent to (not within) that set of things that I, in fact, like.

Strange, dark, creepy....I love it. I'm certainly a fan of Gorey and can't wait to read the other 'Amphigorey' books. Each story is told with various black and white drawings. I have to say, this book is *not* for children. Some of the stories are just ghastly, such as The Gashlycrumb Tinies. Learn your ABC's along with rhyming verse telling how small children die. I'm sure Gorey is not for everyone. But those looking for strange and unusual and macabre, this is for you.",7,10

47559,Amphigorey,Laura,434,16,4,"May 7, 2022","I’ve been (forcing) Kai and I to read these every night. Well, most nights. Yesterday we got into a tussle over the limericks. We are both sick as a dog w covid. I complained that she wasn’t sounding jolly or bouncy enough and as a former slam poetry performer she should know about performing meter correctly!! Smh. My favorite story was “The Hapless Child”. It is so cruel and sad that it becomes comical. When the brute got the horrors I about lost it. Kai liked the insect god for its lovecraftian horror, she liked the other bug one because the ending was so abrupt and subverted her expectations, and also liked the hapless child. I loved the first story about the process of writing a novel. Sometimes reading them all together has a negative effect, because the constant child abuse and tragedy gets to be a little repetitive when it’s all at once like this. I get that it’s intentionally over the top so that it crosses the line into being almost funny/ridiculous, but sometimes it’s like jeez!! We are all really here for the illustrations and the beautiful lettering. I got the other 2 amphigoreys so I can’t wait to read more. It’s interesting to compare my reaction to The Hapless Child with my negative reaction to the graphic novel Megahex. Both are full of over the top violence, literally nothing good happens at all. Yet the Hapless Child made me laugh and was my favorite out of the whole collection while megahex repulsed me. Megahex was just bleak and nihilistic while this retains a certain charm. I am always bringing up a series of unfortunate events, but it is plain to see Gorey’s influence on Lemony Snicket. The sense of humor is the same, and Gorey’s illustrations remind me of Brett Helquist’s. Tim Burton as well. I just googled it and found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p8iA... wow!",6,2

  EDWARD GOREY’S BEST WORKS JAM-PACKED INTO ONE VOLUME!
After reading Edward Gorey’s morbid classic The Gashlycrumb Tinies (which is also surprisingly in this volume), I just had to read more of Edward Gorey’s works and I managed to pick up a volume of his works called “Amphigorey” and boy, was I amazed at the stories in this collection!In this volume, there is a collection of fifteen stories written by Edward Gorey and they include:
  1)	The Unstrung Harp2)	The Listing Attic3)	The Doubtful Guest4)	The Object-Lesson5)	The Bug Book6)	The Fatal Lozenge7)	The Hapless Child8)	The Curious Sofa9)	The Willowdale Handcar10)	The Gashlycrumb Tinies11)	The Insect God12)	The West Wing13)	The Wuggly Ump14)	The Sinking Spell15)	The Remembered Visit
Wow! I never would have thought that I would find part of the complete collection of Edward Gorey’s works since he noted at the introduction that most of his works were expensive and hard to find, so he made this compilation of all of his works, which was fine with me! After reading most of his works in this volume, I have a greater appreciation for Edward Gorey’s writing style as the majority of stories he had written were truly morbid and gruesome to read through! Just reading about murders and people dying of unnatural causes was just a treat for me to read since I love reading really morbid stories with effective illustrations! Edward Gorey’s illustrations clearly compliment the dark and spooky mood of the stories as the colorings are all in black and white, which seems like something that came out of Alfred Hitchcock’s movies. Some of my favorite stories in this volume were:
  The Fatal Lozenge
  
  The Hapless Child
 
  The Gashlycrumb Tinies
  
  The Insect God
  
  The Wuggly Ump
 
  ~A Little Warning~

  THIS BOOK IS NOT EXACTLY FOR CHILDREN!
As I mentioned before, there are many images of characters being killed or dying of unnatural causes and also, there are many stories where children are killed or are being mistreated that could be disturbing for young children. There is also a story called “The Curious Sofa” that implies that sexual activities between several characters are present. Also, the reason why I took off half a point from this book was because I felt that some of the stories in this volume were a bit boring (“The Unstrung Harp” was my least favorite story) and some stories were a bit difficult to understand since the language is a bit old-fashioned for the modern audience.Overall, “Amphigorey” is a great collection of stories for fans of Edward Gorey’s works and anyone who loves reading about morbid stories would definitely enjoy this collection! I would recommend this volume to older children and teenagers since there are many disturbing moments in this collection and some young readers might not understand the sexual themes in “The Curious Sofa.”Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog",6,N/A

Drawings of proper Edwardians and careful, polite commentary discuss such topics as child abuse, parental death, murder, hauntings, rotting bodies, perversions, ominous scary individuals, strange creatures, insanity, suicide, and religious excess. Gorey explores these subjects in poetry, limericks, readers for 'children', and mild-seeming descriptions of cartoons that appear calm on the surface.I was enchanted and charmed.Included are:The Unstrung HarpThe Listing AtticThe Doubtful GuestThe Object-LessonThe Bug BookThe Fatal LozengeThe Hapless ChildThe Curious SofaThe Willowdale HandcarThe Gashlycrumb TiniesThe Insect GodThe West WingThe Wuggly UmpThe Sinking SpellThe Remembered VisitWe are treated to such inventive verse as:""There was a young woman whose stammerWas atrocious and so was her grammar;But they were not improvedWhen her husband was movedTo knock out her teeth with a hammer.""""There was a young woman named PlunneryWho rejoiced in the practice of gunnery,Till one day unobservant,She blew up a servant,And was forced to retire to a nunnery.""""To his clubfooted child said Lord Stipple,As he poured his post-prandial tipple,'Your mother's behaviourGave pain to Our Saviour,And that's why He made you a cripple.'""And:""The Baby, lying meek and quietUpon the customary rug,Has dreams about rampage and riot,And will grow up to be a thug.""""The Magnate waits upon the pavementFor his enormous limousine,And ponders further child-enslavementAnd other projects still more mean.""""The Suicide, as she is falling,Illuminated by the moon,Regrets her act, and finds appallingThe thought she will be dead so soon.""And:""E is for Ernest who choked on a peach""""F is for Fanny sucked dry by a leech""""I is for Ida who drowned in a lake""""J is for James who took lye by mistake""--While the drawings all show little kids in the moment before something fatal is about to occur.I wish I could have met Gorey.
