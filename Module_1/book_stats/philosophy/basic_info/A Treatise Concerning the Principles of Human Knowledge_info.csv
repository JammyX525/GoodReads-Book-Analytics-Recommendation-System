""A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge"" is one of Berkeley's best known works and in it Berkeley expounds upon this idea of subjective idealism, which in other words is the idea that all of reality, as far as humans are concerned, is simply a construct of the way our brains perceive and according to Berkeley no other sense of reality matters beyond that which we perceive.","George Berkeley (/ˈbɑːrklɪ/;[1][2] 12 March 1685 – 14 January 1753) — known as Bishop Berkeley (Bishop of Cloyne) — was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called ""immaterialism"" (later referred to as ""subjective idealism"" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are only ideas in the minds of perceivers, and as a result cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.Librarian note: There is more than one author in the Goodreads database with this name.George^Berkeley",267,178,109,3024,"['805 (26%)', '970 (32%)', '882 (29%)', '279 (9%)', '88 (2%)']"
