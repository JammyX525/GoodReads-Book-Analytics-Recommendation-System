129237,A Theory of Justice,John Rawls,philosophy,"['Politics', 'Nonfiction', 'Law', 'Classics', 'Political Science', 'Economics']",3.95,"January 1, 1971",824,['N/A'],"Since it appeared in 1971, John Rawls's A Theory of Justice has become a classic. The author has now revised the original edition to clear up a number of difficulties he and others have found in the original book.Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core of the democratic tradition - justice as fairness - and to provide an alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and equal persons. ""Each person,"" writes Rawls, ""possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override."" Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant, Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was when first published.","John Bordley Rawls was an American philosopher and a leading figure in moral and political philosophy. He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard. His magnum opus A Theory of Justice (1971) is now regarded as ""one of the primary texts in political philosophy."" His work in political philosophy, dubbed Rawlsianism, takes as its starting point the argument that ""most reasonable principles of justice are those everyone would accept and agree to from a fair position."" Rawls employs a number of thought experiments—including the famous veil of ignorance—to determine what constitutes a fair agreement in which ""everyone is impartially situated as equals,"" in order to determine principles of social justice.Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999, the latter presented by President Bill Clinton, in recognition of how Rawls's thought ""helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself.""",66,510,293,12216,"['4372 (35%)', '4242 (34%)', '2562 (20%)', '721 (5%)', '319 (2%)']"
