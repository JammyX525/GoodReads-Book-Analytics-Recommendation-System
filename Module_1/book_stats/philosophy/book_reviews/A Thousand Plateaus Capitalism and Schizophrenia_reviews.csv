118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Chris,4,19,5,"September 8, 2008","Tired of seeing everything from the point of view of the individual? Bored of anthropomorphism? This might be the book for you. This book changed the way I think about thinking. Swirls in your pot of boiling water will seem as complex and contingent as hurricanes. The migration of humans will look like the crawling of ants. Most importantly, though, Deleuze and Guattari show everything as a process of strategic movement through territory, whether it be the formation of layers of sediment or nomads trekking through the desert plains. Like a roving spiderweb over the Cartesian grid of your window screen and your city, their thought shows us how to capture new territory while evading capture ourselves. But be wary, because capitalism has been doing just that for longer than we've been alive, and it's much better at it than we are.",31,N/A
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,El,"1,355",504,4,"March 20, 2011","August 9, 2010We will be reading this for our next bookclub selection (because it follows Animals Make Us Human: Creating the Best Life for Animals so well?). Once my boyfriend finds his second copy of this I'll get started. Yes, my boyfriend is the kind of person who owns two copies of this book. Intentionally.I would also like to mention that I will be reading this at the mercy of the one who decided we should read this (who is not my boyfriend, believe it or not - apparently there are other people like him in the world...). And since this person has chosen this and has previously read this himself, I will be ""forced"" to read this book out of order. The ""schedule"" is forthcoming. I am promised that it's only appropriate to read the chapters in a non-linear fashion. My entire face twitched and I might have thrown up a little in my mouth, but hey. You only live once, right?(I think reading this alongside Infinite Jest might make me the most pretentious person ever. Suh-weet! For the record, this most certainly was not my idea.)March 20, 2011(I'm tired.)This is an incredibly difficult book to rate and review, and that's probably how Deleuze and Guattari would have wanted it anyway. It's also incredibly late and I'm half-asleep so anything I say here is really not going to give this book much credit; though whether or not the book deserves much credit is still to be determined. Our book club meets again next Sunday and chances are my opinion will change after we talk about this for another several hours, just like we have done at each meeting since we started this.(I hate spending this much time on any book.)So what I intend to do here is list the chapters in the order our group's moderator decided to have us read the book. Reading the book in order is not necessary, nor is it even recommended. Brian Massumi (translator) writes in his forward,
  The reader is invited to follow each section to the plateau that rises from the smooth space of its composition, and to move from one plateau to the next at pleasure. But it is just as good to ignore the heights. You can take a concept that is particularly to your liking and jump with it to its next appearance. They tend to cycle back. Some might call that repetitious. Deleuze and Guattari call it a refrain.
  
(I hate jumping around in a book.)Since there's no clear direction on how this book should be read the only thing I could do was surrender my reading habits to the moderator. Dude has taught classes on this book and these authors so he's the best person to come up with a plan for me. I guess. This was our reading plan which I hope may be helpful to someone attempting to read this book for the first time:Chapter 2 - 1914: One or Several Wolves?Introduction -RhizomeChapter 14 - 1440: The Smooth and the StriatedChapter 3 - 10,000 BC: The Geology of Morals (Who Does Earth Think It Is?)Chapter 11 - 1837: Of the RefrainChapter 10 - 1730: Becoming-Intense, Becoming-Animal, Becoming-ImperceptibleChapter 6 - November 28, 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?Chapter 9 - 1933: Micropolitics and SegmentarityChapter 12 - 1227: Treatise on Nomadology: - The War MachineChapter 13 - 7000 BC: Apparatus of CaptureChapter 7 - Year Zero: FacialityChapter 5 - 587 AD: On Several Regimes of SignsChapter 4 - November 20, 1923: Postulates of LinguisticsChapter 8 - 1874: Three Novellas, or ""What Happened?""ConclusionThat being said there were a few things that stood out for me and/or I felt the need to write down:p 358: Even in bands of animals, leadership is a complex mechanism that does not act to promote the strongest but rather inhibits the installation of stable powers, in favor of a fabric of immanent relations.p 371: Slow and rapid are not quantitative degrees of movement but rather two types of qualified movement...p 376: Because the less people take thought seriously, the more they think in conformity with what the State wants. Truly, what man of the State has not dreamed of that paltry impossible thing - to be a thinker?p 381: Movement is extensive; speed is intensive.p 400: Affect vs. emotion: Affect is the active discharge of emotion, the counterattack, whereas feeling is an always displaced, retarded, resisting emotion. Affects are projectiles just like weapons; feelings are introceptive like tools.Learning to undo things, and to undo oneself, is proper to the war machine: the ""not-doing"" of the warrior, the undoing of the subject.p 438-39: The same could be said for the last love. Proust has shown how a love can be oriented toward its own limit, its own margin: it repeats it's own ending. A new love follows, so that each love is serial, so that there is a series of loves. But once again, ""beyond"" lies the ultimate, at the point where assemblage changes, where the assemblage of love is superseded by an artistic assemblage - the Work to be written, which is the problem Proust tackles...p 460: Should we then speak of ""voluntary servitude""? This is like the expression ""magical captive"": its only merit is to underline the apparent mystery. There is a machinic enslavement, about which it could be said in each case that it presupposes itself, that it appears as preaccomplished; this machinic enslavement is no more ""voluntary"" than it is ""forced"".p 102-03: Or the way Black Engish and any number of ""ghetto languages"" set American English in variation, to the point that New York is virtually a city without a language. (Furthermore, American English could not have constituted itself without this linguistic labor of the minorities.)Good gravy, there's a lot of ground covered here and I'm not sure there is enough space for all my different thoughts. Am I glad to have read this cover-to-cover? Oy. That's a loaded question.It's fascinating stuff as in listening to two insane genius mo-fo's is fascinating. The idea is to take a few thoughts from one philosopher, etc., throw those thoughts into a salad mixer, dump it out and there's Deleuze and Guattari. It's still lettuce, right? But not quite the same kind of lettuce that you first put in.But my point throughout all of this reading is that I'm not sold on the idea that salad mixers need to exist. I don't own one because (ding-ding-ding!) I can mix my own salad. Deleuze and Guattari borrowed ideas from Freud and Marx and some other people, kind of tossed it all around, threw in some totally made-up words to help cement their status as crazy assholes points, and presented it as an entirely new way of thinking.The thing I wasn't able to really get past - and the thing that almost made my book club partners want to smother me with a rhizomatic pillow - is that I'm not certain any of this was necessary. Deleuze and Guattari clearly were crazy mad geniuses, that's not the issue. But I'm always a little wary of someone that comes along and is all like, ""Hey, I have this new way of thinking - listen up!"" They're usually the same people who are handing out glasses of grape-flavored Kool-Aid.Then again, as stated above, there were some moments of complete clarity. Some of what Delusional and Guitar had to say actually resonated with me. Of course then they'd go off in a complete different direction and I'd still be back in the dust just patting myself on the back for actually getting something. Oh, it's not just about a flying vagina, I get it now...And - perhaps not surprisingly - I have found myself making connections between this stupid book and other stupid books I was reading at the same time. Especially Infinite Jest in which I found this whole passage that was obviously paying homage to D&G. I didn't think it could even be possible, but dude. It was right there in front of my face. And then the whole capitalism thing - gave a little flavor to freaking Atlas Shrugged; not that it mattered though - I mentioned Ayn Rand in our book club meeting and tried to compare the two texts and was met with blank looks and crickets.Mostly this book pissed me off. Which really just means that I need to read it like fifty more times to really pick up on all the right points. I suck at math and reading this book at times felt like reading one giant word problem. Until tonight I wasn't even certain the word problem would ever actually end. I looked forward to the Conclusion most of all, thinking that conclusions are the time to sort of re-summarize all the main points, or at least the thesis, and maybe it will all come together for me. Silly rabbit! This conclusion wrote the whole damn book over again, but crammed it this time into just a couple of pages. Geniuses!Way to go, Messieurs Deleuze and Guattari.I hate you both and you have ruined my life.",25,12
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Gary  Beauregard Bottomley,934,556,5,"January 16, 2022","There is a method to the madness within this extraordinary book. At first blush it often seems as if it’s a hodgepodge of a mish mash of stray threads at most loosely connected concerning the paradox of existence, but this book never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously within its post-structuralism paradigms therefore allowing the reader to pretend to believe what the author’s are saying is deserving of the reader’s attention.By pretending to believe what the author’s are saying the book starts to make sense when the reader realizes that the book has multiple levels of interpretations: narrative, literal, metaphorical, and absolute rather than analogical. The book often at times reads as if it was a post-modern novel where space and time have been collapsed into a world without past or future but only the now of synchronic contingency. The authors’ form of post-structuralism is convinced that the truth is out there and knowable and being qua being is directly knowable. They’ll mention that relative and analogical relationships are not enough and that haecceity can get us beyond the vagueness of the essence that Husserl hypothesizes with his hyletics, (defn: The study of matter or raw impressions of an intentional act; the abstraction from the form) as a starting point. Haecceity is a Duns Scotus way for experiencing the world and invokes an appeal to an object’s thisness and thatness distinction and believes being is knowable as being (being qua being) as in contrast from Thomas Aquinas who believes the supreme good is only knowable analogically. These authors think along the same lines as Scotus and try to collapse the being and becoming, or the appearance and reality, form and content, or other such dichotomies into a post-structuralist super-structure. The authors will say nomads are people of the desert without spaces separated by strata which have no history and thus no culture and therefore are the true warriors and worthy of growth and even a Henry Miller can be a nomad within the city as he walks by himself at night in a world constructed with rhizomes (a word the authors coined with significant philosophical meaning for the text and it gets at the sameness within the one until it’s a multiple, one needs to read the whole book to really get at what they mean). Fascism needs a multiple of the intensity in order to thrive and all of the themes in this book are anti-fascist and anti-Spengler. Oswald Spengler gets quoted once but not from his seminal fascist book, Decline of the West, but from one of his lesser-known works. Spengler believes the opposite from what the first sentence in this paragraph states and from what Deleuze and Guattari are saying within this book as a whole. When in doubt on understanding what the authors are saying, it’s possible to just say think the opposite of what Spengler said.The authors speak about a Body Without Organs (BWO). It is part of the abstract machine that holds all of our thoughts together and its ‘grey book’ is Spinoza’s Ethics and exemplifies what they mean, according to the authors. It is the One of Spinoza and is the explanation for the One substance that makes up everything in the universe until the rhizome devolves into the multiplicity of the many. Also, not from this book, I would say BWO is partly explained as the abstract machine that is the ‘ontological difference’ between being and becoming, or subjective and objective, and so on. I’d like to note how I discovered this book; I saw a review on Goodreads by someone who was reviewing this book and definitely did not like it because of its difficulty and said something about the BWO and a commentator (one of my Goodread friends, I think) said ‘your full of shit’. Two things, if I see a review for a book and the person says it’s difficult to understand, I know I want to read it, and if someone else says someone else is ‘full of shit’, I know I want to see why they would say that. The authors are writing a post-structuralist defense and are rejecting relational truths knowable only by analogical and are sneaking in the Haecceity of Duns Scotus and his synchronic contingency (all understanding is of the now, not the past or future except for ultimate Being who sees all at once). The German Mark on November 20, 1923 was made into a German Mark but with a trillion to one ratio and that solved that nation’s travails through the recoding of the code axiomatically thus leading to a beer hall putsch and paving the way for a re-coding of the code such that a multiplicity of power would be manifested into a Hitler and the Nazis. The axioms (a word they use frequently) that float around us, determine us until they don’t. The authors are right when they say Bergson is right to criticize Einstein’s general theory since it uses stratified space and smooth space gets pushed aside and he needed Riemann space which is not a metric space since time gets convoluted within space with the self-referential transformation. The authors are dealing with literal truths while they are telling their narrative on the nature of being qua being in a post-structural world that they are constructing, all the while they never really take themselves seriously since they ultimately know that means they could never be seriously taken. I cite this example from this book mostly to show how all encompassing this book is at times and how Bergson had a point. The book makes the point that Norm Chomsky universal grammar is not necessarily wrong but that he just didn’t go far enough. Linguistics is a big part of the book. They’ll also say that psychoanalysis will discover the hidden reasons even when they aren’t there. The author’s preferred psychology, schiozoidanalysis, is a big part of the book. The definite not becoming the indefinite is another large part of the book. Art reflecting the inner difference between nature and the human is a big part. Economics, history, anthropology are all dissected by the authors. This book is equivalent to the first two years of undergraduate study for most students, and then some. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. These authors loved Carlos Castaneda and his fictional mystical book The Teachings of Don Juan. I always thought of him as a fake mystic not worthy of my consideration. I’m tempted to read his first book even though I truly hate any book that encourages psychedelic drug taking for recreational purposes. Overall, I want to say that this book does have a narrative that ties the book together. It has a literal meaning within its sections that the reader can get without reflection, and it has a metaphorical meaning that the reader has to piece together, and finally, the authors are post-structural and think the truth is out there and being qua being is knowable. This book reads like some of my favorite post-modern fictional books such as Gravity’s Rainbow, Third Policeman, or like Finnigans Wake or The Divine Comedy. There is a meaning within the text but the reader needs to collapse space and time such that they see beyond the narrative, get the literal meaning of the text and see the metaphor all at once and the reader is rewarded with figuring out if the truth is really out there and knowable as Duns Scotus and the authors believe or the truth is knowable by relation, analogy and relativism as Thomas Aquinas would say. These are the kind of books that makes reading most pleasurable for me. I liked this book so much that I even read all the end notes, and I noticed a lot of what the authors really believed seemed to be hidden within them while it was not always obvious within the main text.",18,3
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Maxwell,40,169,5,"February 6, 2019","You’d be forgiven for walking away from Anti-Oedipus thinking that deterritorialization is positive and liberatory force, and the circumscription of reterritorialization, reactionary and oppressive. Anti-Oedipus endorses schizophrenia, immanence and multiplicity while still using binary terms for its lavish metaphysics. This is to some degree inevitable. A Thousand Plateaus begins the process of ungluing these manichean oppositions but doesn’t quite undo the latent hierarchies. A Thousand Plateau’s broadest sense is one that discourages broad sense; micro-revolutions in molecular fields of difference rather than overturning molar aggregates. But even the most decentered register will come up against some hard limits; the only way to see the vampiric reflection of capital is in a black pool of oil. A Thousand Plateaus is a demimonde of ambiguity and exceptions but D&G’s allegiance to one side of their dualistic coinages is always clear--The arborescent is bad; rhizomatics are good. Stratification is bad; destratification is good. Striated space is bad; smooth space is good. Suddenly, we have a power relationship, a normative claim about the general superiority of one function or entity, even if it’s subtle, complex and multidirectional. This is not a criticism; absolute fidelity to schizoanalysis, rhizomatics, molecular politics or whatever you want to call it would lead to total incoherency. D&G’s terms are always polyphonic and encase an sprawling system of internal difference. But the schism from Hegel and psychoanalysis (especially Lacan) is less dramatic than it is presented, the terms and claims of dialectics and psychoanalysis do, after all, possess identities which are multiple and variegated. Some of Capitalism & Schizophrenia’s pugilistic oppositions seem more operatic than theoretical. (Before anyone corrects me to say “deterritorialization can be destructive” etc, I have heard this from many avid Deleuzians and I don’t doubt their sincerity--but I don’t believe that most people of a schizoanalytical persuasion think that the unwriting of territories is a bad thing except in certain specialized cases) A Thousand Plateaus also backtracks some of the more extravagant claims of Anti-Oedipus, stratifying indexes which delimit the acceleration of deterritorializing flows. These ‘black holes’ are fascistic traps which ‘coil inwards’ toward the installation of binaries, hierarchies and the dialectical deletion of new lines of flight. I’ve spoken interminably about acceleration(ism) recently, so all I’ll say is; my deepest sympathies to Nick Land. I have a certain level of confusion and dismay over the affirmationist vitalism at the morphogenetic heart of D&G. I think to some degree the negative is inscribed onto either the topology of our perception or whatever contours of the real are accessible by that perception. The Capitalism & Schizophrenia books model desire as ‘machinic’ (along with the unconscious, the social body and most other things)--and machines burn fuel and cough tubercular exhaust. They are built with their expiration and obsolescence in mind. Deft and dexterous theoretical maneuvers are prosecuted to try and extirpate dialectical negativity and the death drive but I don’t know that they can be quashed by a patchwork monism. The negative is resilient--and competition & entropy possess an undeniable (even affirmative) presence. How can we get past that Anti-Oedipus is a supremely Oedipal book? Capitalism & Schizophrenia wants to vanquish the choreographed arborescence of their father’s law and rejoin to the oceanic univocity of the maternal monism; or, kill Daddy Hegel and return to Mommy Spinoza. I want to restate that I don’t think this is a bad thing. Recently I’ve found Deleuze extremely useful for understanding a wide variety problems. But it’ll be a cold day in the climate catastrophe holocene before you get me to substitute Bergson for Freud. A Thousand Plateaus is somehow more fun to read than Anti-Oedipus despite being immensely more difficult. There are single paragraphs that cascade across multiple pages referencing a remit of inconceivably diverse knowledge. It reads like nonsense at first blush. But when I read these sections back I always I understand a little more, the coiled digits begin to articulate. If you have the patience to reread a paragraph three or four times, the reticent typologies WILL unfurl into ontogenetic dynamisms. The gift that keeps on becoming. On the other hand, there are individual sentences carved with the precision of a jeweller’s hands which can overturn everything you thought you knew prior to reading them, even upon glancing contact. Someone told me that Guattari wrote the Capitalism & Schizophrenia books on drugs and Deleuze edited / refined them on even more drugs. I don’t know if that’s true but I really hope it is. The concept-salad from Spinoza, Nietzsche and Bergson accretes into molar aggregates which can be picked apart, reconfigured and developed, perhaps indefinitely. I think the popularity of D&G well into the time of my writing this at the end of 2018 (over 50 years since May 1968 which will always be remembered alongside these books) has to do with the insistence upon the contingency of structures and the importance of outlying flows, energies, data, etc which escape the architecture of the structure. These books are a project which invite universal participation. This isn’t much of a review, just some disorganized thoughts I had while reading A Thousand Plateaus which is a book containing erudition vast beyond my comprehension with each plateau embedded with singularities it could take a lifetime to understand. My complaints may seem quibbling, and in some sense they are, as I’m just thinking aloud while I try to understand the points of dispute in two dominant currents of continental philosophy. This book is stunningly brilliant and probably lapped me several times while I wittered “but the dialectic...” Oh and it’s actually like 15 plateaus.",17,4
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Sir Jack,77,30,1,"February 26, 2008","This is basically a nonreview: like a restless nomad I would read several pages of one section and then find myself completely unable to go on, and then I’d move to the next one. Same for the next chapter and the next. Right from the beginning I knew I had already read too much of this type of writing to have much patience for it. Here’re the authors justifying the fact that they affixed their names to the books they write:“Why have we kept our own names? Out of habit, purely out of habit. To make ourselves unrecognizable in turn. To render imperceptible, not ourselves, but what makes us act, feel, and think. To reach, not the point where one no longer says I, but the point where it is no longer of any importance whether one says I. We are no longer ourselves. We have been aided, inspired, multiplied.”Sigh. How easy it is to date and place such writing: it could only be sixties-spawned poststructuralist theory. The way the book seeks to undermine “structured” or “phallocentric” (of course) thinking is humorlessly rigorous. There’s one chapter comparing States to “chieftans,” and there is not one mention of any country and hardly any reference to a single specific example (references to “the Orient” don’t count). Such breezy abstractions are the antithesis of Foucault’s fine-grained analyses of actual social structures. The main philosopher they rail against (and neatly simplify) is Plato, who was writing philosophy 2,400 years ago. Plato is like Satan to these theorists: Everything is his fault.Like many theorists, the authors are at their worst when they turn their maniacal gaze onto fiction. But they can’t resist, they must say something. Here is a representative sentence concerning literature (they’re talking about Moby Dick and Kafka’s “Josephine the Singer”):“It is always with the Anomalous that one enters into alliance to become-animal.” [SIC!]This will sound brisk and simplistic (like most of this review, perhaps), but I really do think that theorists in general just don’t *get* fiction. They have no taste. (See, for a chilling example, anything Frederic Jameson has said about literature.)I exclude Foucault, an insanely original thinker, from the above critical statements about theorists. ",16,18
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Clinton Smith,57,3,3,"June 2, 2013","The idea: Society is a vertically organized enterprise. Different concepts are used to attempt to implement a sort of control over others; the control of language, and of grammar itself, could be considered a type of imperialism...to paraphrase, there's no quicker way to implement a sort of control over a group of people than to ensure that they cannot have a voice within a society without adhering to strictly delineated guideline regarding how to write/how to speak. In response to the vertically oriented, top-down society, a ""nomad"" thought emerges in response, one that refuses to settle down within the predominant format, one that chooses to countermand the society. The development of a counter-reactive force to society, however, a society that attempts to eradicate ""nomad thought"", thought that does not organize into hierarchies and the idea of the have and the have-not, requires a ""rhizomatic"" form of connection. Imagine a set of differentiated cells that, rather than resting on a vertical plane, are organized horizontally, with the formation of different shapes, different types of conformities that help upend the tyranny of the dominant language, the dominant order. The rhizome is a dendrite that allows the players and actors in this philosophical field to connect outside the field of the hierarchy, in a way that could be more effectual than that of the ""nomad""...for the ""nomad"" cannot by the sheer definition form an alternate to what DeLeuze and Guattari call ""the war machine"": the manner in which a society exerts control (and the ""war machine"" itself is much more effective if coercion can exist without war). These horizontal connections among those who have learned to become organs without bodies, that is, banished the internal hierarchies within their own personal thinking and concept of organization of their own bodies, are a potential counteractive force against coercion...OK. Beyond that, a few words. The book has chapters, called plateaus, but I'd have to say that there doesn't seem to be any great degree of organization. Indeed, DeLeuze and Guattari indicate that one could read the book in any order, skip large parts, etc. The most pivotal chapters are probably the first (simply to become acclimated to the writing, which is somewhat inscrutable, exhortational, and didactic all at the same time...truly remarkable, though it wears a bit thin after 400 pages of it), then ""How to Become a Body Without Organs,"" then ""Nomadology: The War Machine."" Under no circumstances (in my opinion) should the chapter on ""Nomadology"" be read before the ""body without organs"" chapter; best flow is reading the ones that focus on the individual reaction to the linguistic implements of imperialism, then the ones that deal more with group reactions. Anyone who is expecting some sort of detailed critique of capitalism (and, if you're reading this to begin with, you're probably not...ie, you probably know what you're in for, or are familiar with DeLeuze and Guattari, who are brilliant if a bit discursive), this isn't the book. Finally, the book does reward patience, but (if philosophy is not your primary interest in your reading) you will need it...it is not an easy read, and the ""plateaus"" often ""ramble"" for 10-15 pages before they get to their core insight. Remember that, at their core, and amidst all of their other intellectual interests, what you have here is a philosopher/linguist and a psychiatrist who collaborated; in the end, everything is somewhat seen through the filter of language and how the use of language and other types of communication could possibly bring about changes of a society at its margins (while their posturing may suggest otherwise, I'd posit the idea that DeLeuze and Guattari are savvy enough to realize that most people aren't going to be able to read this book and understand it well enough to translate the concepts into potential society-changing thoughts on a large scale...). But, if you really love DeLeuze, this is of course indispensable...though you'll probably already have read it. :)",11,1 comment
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Mike,102,7,4,"October 5, 2010","Any book of philosophy that features a chapter in which a geologist (named Challenger no less) undergoes a metamorphosis while delivering a lecture is pretty good. What takes it to the next level is what Challenger the geologist turns into: a lobster! This book has it all from Deleuze and Guattari: wolf packs, war machines, nomadologies, becomings-animal, rhizomes, the differences between the games of Go and Chess, and plenty of rips on Freud and psychoanalysis. My favorite chapters were the introduction (Rhizomes), the first chapter on wolves, the 'becoming-intense, becoming-animal' chapter, the 'Body without Organs' chapter, and the final chapter. Hell, just read the whole book.I can't give it five stars because there are a few passages that are a bit lengthy and overly technical, but perhaps I missed the joke in those passages. Regardless, this is definitely a book worth taking a look at again, with all of its messiness and intensity and humor.

118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Christoph,95,13,3,"October 6, 2010","I am torn on this review and rating. On the one-hand I recognize this as one of the quintessential post-modern tomes up there with Lyotard's Postmodern Condition or Foucault's The Archaeology of Knowledge but on the other hand, the quixotic hubris in this text is almost overbearing. It really depends on how I am looking at the purpose of the writing. If i try to look at it like a true philosophical text with intended insight and description, it falls completely flat. It truly is the inane charting of ontology (even if not hierarchical ontology) like Husserl's Phenomenology for a significant portion of the text. But whereas Husserl was truly tilting at windmills, Deleuze and Guttari seem to be bullfighting them. On the other hand, if I view this as surrealist prose with as much meaning as a non-sequitur then I can appreciate this book as the most beautifully coherent yet abstract expressionist writing I have ever seen.The subtitle of the book points to the two main objects of the critical theory developed here: hegemonic economics (capitalism) and hegemonic psychology (psychoanalysis). But neither ever seem to be directly addressed. The book seems to be nothing but a series of tangents vacillating between descriptions of how to use the method, actual methodological analysis associated generally with topics relating to the two objects mentioned above, and then there are the non-sequiturs. Since one never truly understands the intention of the writing other than to get lost in the hubris of deterritorializing reterritorialized lines of flight back to some strata in some assemblage comprising an abstract machine (I am sorry that statement is the most meaningless concept ever devised), I cannot accept this as an actual method of critical thought. That said, there are conceptions in here that when not trying to be so diagrammatical are ingenious and necessary for conceptualizing our time. The idea of the rhizome and how it could describe contemporary social networks or the stratification of elements within a concept. Also, the discourse on Chomsky's linguistic theory (why is Chomsky such a common punching bag for the post-modernists?) is probably the most compelling. Meanwhile the embedded text aka Nomadology is literally the most farcical foray into meaningless abstract pretension I have endured although the distinction of royal versus normal science is a tangential concept in that section worth investigating (although already done to some degree by TS Kuhn about twenty years before).That this book can both me overwhelmingly insightful in one breath and crushingly bombastic the next without ever truly revealing whether this is completely meant to be serious, a joke, neither or both, tells me there is something much more to this. But frankly, I do not have the patience to sit through it again to find out. Perhaps, at the least, as reference. ",5,N/A

118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Thomas,50,21,5,"April 9, 2021","I left this book mostly-read for nearly a year due to mental health issues, unemployment, bad employment, strained relationships, you name it. Every time I came back to it I knew I was getting at something that was totally brilliant and unique but it is nevertheless hard work, and when I'm already at capacity in all other areas all I feel like doing is escaping the hard work. It's been a bleak time in my life and despite having so much literature in my day-to-day it's also been the longest stretch in which I've read little to nothing. At one point I finally just put all my feelings aside and sat down with it, and after remembering how much of a pleasure this is to go through time just flew by. Much more dense and overcomplicated than its predecessor, but in some ways it's also a million times better than Anti-Oedipus. This is such an exciting way of drawing out a philosophy; a real ground-up idea that takes its abstract points and makes them universally relevant and applicable. Mathematical theories, novels, political bodies, biological organisms, music, culture. There's nothing that doesn't fall in line with the beautiful minds of Deleuze and Guattari, and the connections are never flimsy or a reach, not to me at least lol. This book is a comprehensive love letter to D&G's collaboration since as early as their reactions to the 68' riots, it tries to capture a certain understanding of reality through a scientifically-directed notion of molecular-to-molar relations so that it can try and offer a thorough understanding of the existence of larger systems like capitalism, imperialism, fascism and nomad war machines. I always found the word 'politicised' strange to say, and reading this only reinforced the reflections I had of its superfluous nature as some kind of rhetorical accusation. Every abstract machine is tied together and is 'inseparably political, economic, scientific, artistic, ecological, cosmic – perceptive, affective, active, thinking, physical, and semiotic', to borrow some words from them. I'm not going to be able to say absolutely everything about this, but I'm happy that although I was struggling for a while, I ultimately managed to find refuge and solace in this book. Both dated and timeless, forever relevant and abstract. Mechanosphere.",4,N/A
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Charlie,116,14,5,"July 20, 2008","Finally, finally, I have finished this book, I was very definitely punching above my weight trying to read this, but overall I have enjoyed it thoroughly, well perhaps not enjoyed the actual reading of it, but this book has provided such a vast resource of ideas for me, I don't regret a single one of the many months that it has taken me to read through this, this is a huge personal achievement for me, now that I have read this I feel like I could read anything.For the most of this book the subject matter is suitably sprawling, but there is a fair chunk devoted to the pairs earlier musings on capitalism dissected in anti-Oedipus, having not read that book I feel it would have been useful for what comprises one of the main propositions of the book.I had felt for a long time reading this book that it is better taken chapter by chapter and seen more as a collection of essays, but the duo manage to very skilfully marry all of the various ideas in the book together in the last chapter, a great deal of the ideas slot in together at this point, and you begin to see the bigger picture of what Deleuze & Guttari are getting at, and it really is quite an awe inspiring vision. That being said I still couldn't really profess to know what an abstract machine was, let alone differentiate between the different types of abstract machine. But I think that it is o.k. to not get this because they seem to be saying that this is the thing that links everything together and is the gel that holds together everything we understand, so ultimately the boys are setting their sights pretty high in terms of what they are trying to achieve.Overall the main merit of this book is its skill in not treating things that are collectively subjective as being much closer to being objective. If enough people are aware of a phenomena then it is there whether it is objective or otherwise, and should be treated in this manner, adopting this stance Deleuze and Guttari delve into subjects many others feed to tread, and making some surprisingly logical and poignant observations.",4,1 comment
118316,A Thousand Plateaus Capitalism and Schizophrenia,Troy,300,134,5,"November 21, 2013","I've finally finished this difficult, confusing, brilliant book. I've been reading it for years; off and on; a chapter here, a chapter there. (And a warning about that: in the beginning of this book, the authors claim that you can read the book like a record player, reading a chapter here and a chapter there, but that really isn't true. The book rhymes, sure, but it also builds concepts and ideas, starting from some basic premises and building up to some pretty in-depth case studies. It's really worth reading it from start to finish, which is not the way I read the book.)There is no review that could sum up this behemoth of ideas. This book touches on so many things. They're arguing for a new way of conceiving and approaching the world, starting with a new conception between substance and form, expression and content, and leading up to a new way of conceiving power, the State, war, and ""lines of flight,"" which is one of the concepts that the book sets out to explain.I really can't give you a summary. I really can't give you ""my take."" I will say that there are massive parts of it that I need to read again, and there are very fundamental concepts that I just don't understand (the event, haecceity, the machinic assemblage).I will tell you that my recent re-immersion into the book came from one of the better reading groups I've ever been part of. We read a fair chunk of A Thousand Plateaus together, which at times was a real joy. I will also tell you that what I love to do most of all with theory is find out what I can use and what I jettison. I want to fight with what I'm reading, and I want to be able to know it well enough to point my finger and shout ""bullshit"" in a shrill voice. But that's not the case with Delueze (and Guattari) and I'm afraid that won't be the case for awhile. First, I need to understand their basic fights, who are with a panoply of philosophical figures, and I have to figure out which of those fights I care about.",4,1 comment
