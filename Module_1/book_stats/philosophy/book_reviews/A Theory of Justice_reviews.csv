129237,A Theory of Justice,Tyler ,323,304,5,"January 27, 2011","What strikes me most as a non-philosopher reading this book is what Rawls doesn’t talk about. Libertarian ideas, the staple of American political and social discourse, receive no attention as such in this book. To the extent that libertarianism factors in at all, Rawls dismisses it so peremptorily he practically laughs at it. Yet his oblique approach does take on its precepts, as I‘ll mention later.A Theory of Justice takes up a problem that goes back to the Enlightenment: If rights inure to individual persons, what role can society really play in our lives? Key to this paradox, it is argued, are the concepts of the good and of the right. There can be no meaningful notion of the good independent of a concept of what’s right, or just. A good society, then, cannot let its moral structure be dictated by its economic practices. The author construes justice from a Kantian standpoint and employs principles such as universalizability to make Rawls’s theory one that guarantees justice at the start, as opposed to one in which justice arises contingently from later developments.The author dials us back to the state of nature, the famous theoretical starting point of Locke and Rousseau from which a society somehow must emerge. His unique angle is that he finds the state of nature inadequate as a starting point, so he modifies it into an “original position,” a point from which individuals can reason more effectively about the kind of social contract they ought to agree to. Here Rawls’s distinctive concept of the veil of ignorance comes into play.Rawls advocates an objective and rational social contract theory. His book takes aim at two alternatives, utilitarianism and perfectionism. Outside dictatorships, he says, these are the two principles that actually do drive social and government policies in the rest of the world -- hence an example of the oblique swatdown of libertarian ideas. He takes apart both theories and proposes his own, based on a notion of equal liberties. Justice entails equal liberty for each person, and this principle has priority over other concepts. Of special note, too, is Rawls’s discussion of justification. It is misguided, he argues, to justify any system on the basis of deduction or induction from starting principles. Starting principles alone will prove unable to account for a social system in its entirety. Justification for a system of social organization must come from a judgment of the system as a totality. That is, justification comes from within that system, taken as a whole. Here the critique of other ideals is less oblique, and the disagreement more contentious.Libertarianism, this text implies, relies on principles common to many viewpoints. It’s these grounding principles that come under scrutiny throughout the book. He attacks the conflation of a self with one’s own self, dismissing theories that fail to reason objectively. Late in the book (by which I mean to say: You cannot get by reading just part of it) he critiques the idea of private society. He uses Kant to contrast people treated as ends with people treated as means, repudiating notions that derive the value of a human life from an individual’s social function. He asks what‘s really meant by “deserving“ something. Through Kant, too, he links natural rights with natural duties. Altruism he denies as a duty of justice: His original position is one of rational self-interest. Rawls stresses the ideal nature of his theory, not its practical applications. The implication of his reasoning is that, rather than using ideals as the basis of some sort of revolution, whoever understands this theory will be able to apply it in small ways throughout society. It can also be applied piecemeal by people in authority within a society or government without having suddenly to rewrite the entire existing social arragement. The ideal theory empowers people to act on practical problems rather than dream of a perfect but unattainable future utopia.I rate this book highly and recommend it to everyone. It is a work of philosophy that is accessible to non-philosophers, giving it a great advantage over philosophical works destined to remain within the confines of academia. It is a complete work, covering every aspect of society. It is highly innovative in its conception, a thought experiment laid out by a compelling and provocative line of reasoning. It carves out a specific niche in political thought. The proposal Rawls lays out has explanatory and predictive power. The book is perfect for people who love to read about ideas; but best of all, it satisfies the need of individuals to find some way to insert themselves into today's dramatically depersonalized social structure, a system that has arisen in our world through a mixture of complex technology and simple cruelty.",44,5
129237,A Theory of Justice,N,3,1 follower,1,"July 25, 2015","I read this ... gosh, about fifteen years ago now. Something about it always bugged me. Rawls is trying to build on Kant's theory of ethics. Kant's thing was classic Enlightenment: trying to divorce morality from Christianity. Rawls' development is the veil of ignorance - essentially a social contract based on the Golden Rule. The question is, what's your foundation for doing unto others as you would have them do unto you? Rawls doesn't argue from Christianity, of course, nor natural law, but self-interest. Put on the veil of ignorance such that you aren't sure of your social standing. Now set up a system of justice that you'd be okay with whether you're a Yale-educated white male earning $200k a year or somebody from Nickel and Dimed, or (in a grimmer example from the 1940s) a blond-haired, blue-eyed member of the Master Race or a Jew. You don't set minimum wage at $1/hour and you don't make it legal to gas minorities because you might turn out to be on the receiving end when the veil is lifted. Self-interest. Simple, yes? The problem with the veil of ignorance is that it gets lifted - and when self-interest is your philosophical foundation, it doesn't just magically disappear on the back end. It reverts to might makes right. Maybe not at first, particularly if there's a balance of power. The Cold War is the classic example: with thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at each other, the Soviets and Americans could grudgingly say, ""I won't nuke you if you won't nuke me"" ... mutually assured destruction, all that. But countries like, say, Grenada, found out pretty quickly there was another set of rules, and that's how you wind up on the receiving end of Operation Urgent Fury. ""What happened to the Golden Rule?"" the weak have asked throughout history. ""What can you possibly do unto us?"" is the reply of the strong. ",23,1 comment
129237,A Theory of Justice,Wendy,498,9,4,"February 7, 2010","So, first off: this is a work of academic philosophy. I think it's very readable and entertaining for a work of academic philosophy, but this is probably not a book to take to the beach. It also helps if you've had a basic course in philosophy, or have recently read a book like Michael Sandel's Justice, because the book will be very hard going if you don't have at least a glimmer of an idea about utilitarianism or Kantianism. So, why read Rawls? It's often asserted that Rawls's work is the philosophical basis for modern American liberalism. I think it would be more accurate to say that most modern American liberals have a set of intuitions about justice that happen to dovetail pretty well with Rawls's philosophy. But if you are a political liberal, and you feel it's important to have a sound philosophical basis for your liberalism, you've probably got to consider Rawls's position, even if you reject it. Rawls starts with a pretty neat philosophical conceit: the idea that a just society is one that operates by rules that everyone would agree to if they chose a set of rules from behind ""a veil of ignorance"". In other words, without knowing what their society would look like, what position they might occupy in it, or even what sort of goals and interests they might have, what rules would people agree to be bound by? I like this idea, because it seems to me that you can accept the method without necessarily accepting Rawls's conclusions. Also, it seems to offer a way to get at an ethical conception that might not be so tightly bound to a particular philosopher's societal circumstances. Kantianism seems so well-suited to the mind-set of an Enlightenment German Protestant non-conformist that one can't help be a bit suspicious of its general applicability. Though, in all fairness, I have to admit that the rules that Rawls comes up with seem very well suited to the mind-set of a mid-20th century American liberal. He proposes two rules for a just society, which are to be applied in the following order:1. Everyone should have the maximum liberty that is consistent with everyone having the same liberty. 2. Social and economic advantages should be distributed under conditions of fair equality of opportunity, and inequalities in the distribution of such advantages should be allowed only to the extent that such inequalities benefit the least well-favored in society. We get to these rules about 100 pages in. The rest of the book is devoted to explaining what they mean and how they would be applied. It's fascinating stuff, but it defies easy summary. One of the most tricky parts of Rawls's theory is the part about inequalities benefitting the least well-favored - in fact, it's not unusual to see critiques of Rawls that focus exclusively on that, and ignore the rest of his argument. Occasionally you see people go on as if Rawls supported some kind of Harrison Bergeron-like state of absolute enforced equality. This seems silly, since it's hard to see how such a society would be consistent with the principle of maximum liberty (which takes priority over the other principle). Rawls potentially allows for staggeringly large degrees of economic or social inequality, as long as it can be demonstrated that these inequalities benefit the least well-off. Actually doing such a demonstration is left to the economists or the sociologists. Which makes a lot of sense. It's just a bit disappointing to read a 500+ page book on justice, and find that there are still lots of hard questions left to be answered. Still, if forming a perfectly just society were easy, we'd have done it by now. Anyway, this book is not an easy read, but it's well worth reading. I think that even if you disagree with its conclusions (or, like me, think you at least need more time to think about and digest its conclusions), it will change the way you think about justice.

129237,A Theory of Justice,Julio Pino,704,28,4,"December 30, 2022","""In a fight, a liberal is the first one to leave the room"".---"" Big Bill"" Haywood"". I once knew a Yale Professor of Political Science who declared ""John Rawls will still be taught when people like me have long been forgotten."" A rare burst of academic modesty. A THEORY OF JUSTICE is the ne plus ultra defense of Western liberalism, and for that reason alone it is required reading inside and outside the academy. Rawls' central idea in this apologia is summed up in a metaphor: Life is like a roulette wheel. You never know where your particular ball, meaning you, is going to land; in this case before you are born. So, why not design a society around the principle that the best roulette wheel is one where even if you land on the worst spot you will not be left to rot? The liberal roulette wheel guarantees you both personal and economic freedom, whereas conservative wheels are designed to protect property rights, from which other rights flow, and radical wheels, of both the left and the right, promise you a perfect landing spot; not just for you but everybody whose ball is cast. Just one thing though: obiter dicta Rawls once said ""my theory of justice requires a modicum of economic development."" That's like saying the Sahara desert only requires more rain to become habitable! Still, this liberal opus is worth the challenge of reading in full, either in defense or defiance of liberalism.",8,2
129237,A Theory of Justice,Farjana Chowdhury,1,3,4,"December 6, 2011","In ""A Theory of Justice"", John Rawls presents a conception of justice which, as he puts it, generalises and carries to a higher level of abstraction the social contract theory. So, rather than dictating the exact form of government to be applied, the persons in the Rawls' original position would, in trying to further their own interests, decide upon principles of justice to regulate the basic distributive structure of society. Concerned only with institutional justice, the theory dictates that individual distributions are just to the extent that they are made through just institutions.Rawls’ version of the social contract differs from earlier social contract theories in some regards. First, while the original position is Rawls’ equivalent to the state of nature of some earlier theories, he stresses that the original position should not be seen as a historical state, but rather as a hypothetical situation in which the goal is to decide upon a conception of justice. Second, as mentioned earlier, Rawls’ version carries the social contract theory to a higher level of abstraction. While most other social contract theories appeal directly to the judgment of the reader in deciding how society is to be organized, Rawls takes the idea one step further by asking us to imagine to which conclusion people with certain defined properties would come when placed in the original position. Third, there are some restrictions to the choices made in the initial situation. For example, Rawls takes for granted that people in the original position would rather have some form of government than, say, anarchy. Finally, Rawls assumes that the parties in the original position are all looking to securing so-called primary goods which, according to Rawls, are things that every rational person wants, no matter what his or her goals are in life, including such things as liberties, opportunities and wealth.The concept of justice as fairness comes, Rawls argues, not from the idea that justice and fairness are the same, but from the fact that agreements and conclusions are reached in a fair original position. Thus, since the original position is fair, the agreements reached in it are fair, too. Rawls further argues that since the conception of justice agreed upon in the original position is fair, it would bring us as close as we could come to a society in which people have explicitly consented to a certain conception of justice. The idea of justice as fairness is further enforced by the participants in the original position being rational, mutually disinterested, informed in certain areas and lacking knowledge in others. The lack of knowledge about advantageous or disadvantageous natural endowments and social circumstances eliminates a biased conception of justice.To Rawls, it is important that the idea of justice as fairness contrasts that of utilitarianism. He argues that classical utilitarianism, in only looking to maximise utility regardless of how it is divided between individuals, does not take seriously the distinction between persons. He further claims that utilitarianism would not be chosen by the parties in the original position because of the possibility of an enormously disadvantageous division of utility. While this choice admittedly would be made entirely out of self-interest, it is nevertheless effective as an argument in favour of Rawls' idea of justice as fairness.The principles of justice that the persons in the original position would decide upon are, as Rawls presents them in his book, the following:1.First Principle: Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others (Liberty Principle.) 2.Second Principle: Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both reasonably expected to be to everyone's advantage (Difference Principle,) and attached to positions and offices open to all (Principle of Fair Equality of Opportunity.) The first and second principles form the special conception of justice while the general conception of justice is the Difference Principle applied to all social values, phrased by Rawls thus: “All social values – liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect – are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any, or all, of these values is to everyone's advantage.” Later, Rawls changes “everyone's advantage” to “the greatest benefit of the least advantaged” and “the advantage of the least favored” in the Difference Principle and the general conception of justice, respectively. This is not a change in the theory, Rawls would argue, since he holds that if the least advantaged are benefited, so will everyone else.The general conception of justice, Rawls claims, applies to a society in which the social conditions of some restrict them from exercising their basic liberties. When that standard has been reached, the special conception of justice takes over. Within the special conception of justice, there is a lexicographical ordering of principles. The Liberty Principle is placed above the Principle of Fair Equality of Opportunity which, in turn, is placed above the Difference Principle. Only when the conditions of the Liberty Principle have been met does the Principle of Fair Equality of Opportunity come into play, and so on.The reason for dividing the theory into the general and special conceptions of justice, as touched upon earlier, is that unless a level of adequate social conditions is reached, people cannot make use of their basic liberties. Furthermore, Rawls claims that there is a relation between the social conditions in which we find ourselves and how greatly we value liberty. As our social conditions improve, we start to value liberty more and welfare less. When we reach a point at which we value welfare and liberty equally, we can be said to have reached a level of adequate social conditions. Rawls argues that by applying the general conception of justice, this level can hopefully be reached, prompting a switch from the general to the special conception of justice.Arguably, there are some difficulties in the application of the two conceptions of justice on a given society. For one, it seems hard to pin down exactly where to draw the line between adequate and inadequate social conditions. While Rawls does provide some guidelines for this purpose, he does not explain in detail at which point, exactly, the switch between the conceptions would take place. Presumably, the level of adequate social conditions is not invariable. Depending on the nation in which the principles of justice are to be applied, this level must be subject to some variations. For example, if the nation is wealthy, the level of adequate social conditions is presumed to rise. Nevertheless, the idea remains vague and arguably subjective.Another difficulty is that even though the general conception of justice dictates that all social values are to be distributed so as to make the least advantaged as well off as possible, it allows for this distribution to be unequal. This means that while the worst off might reach a level of adequate social conditions, there is a possibility of inequalities growing as a consequence, which result in higher standards of living and higher requirements on people, for example in regards to work opportunities. Indeed, as the general level of well-being rises, so does the level at which we define adequate social conditions. And so, because the level of adequate social conditions constantly changes, we are just as often forced to switch between the general conception and the special conception of justice, resulting in what Rawls would like to avoid; an unstable society.",7,1 comment
129237,A Theory of Justice,Christopher,990,3,3,"July 26, 2014"," I'll just say, like a good number of philosophers, Rawls is not a good writer. His book is repetitive and not anywhere near as concise as it could have been. I was actually rereading it this time out, having read it in school, and was not as taken with it this time out. Pros: 1. The Veil of Ignorance is a great thought experiment, one of the all time greats. Rawls establishes the Kantian idea of autonomous action perfectly. Too bad he quickly abandons Kant and instead creates something more similar to rule consequentialism. 2. Rawls does make a good alternative to something like Nozick and demolishes most of the right wing libertarians most cherished ideas. However, this is really just a good cop bad cop situation. Most American universities teach Rawls and Nozick together, perhaps in the idea that seeing the horror that is Nozick we'll all warm up to Rawls a little better. Cons: 1. Rawls is obsessed with Utility calculations. While Nozick gives us an essentially egoist consequentialism with ""side constraints"" Rawls basically gives us rule utilitarianism. So we get no foundation for rights only an idea that citizens should get equal liberty to others. 2. Rawls also insists that political philosophy is not simply applied ethical philosophy. This may be true, but it leaves him on shaky meta-ethical ground. Like rule consequentialism it looks like Rawls's theory just morphs into whatever is convenient based on the situation. ",7,2

As usual, while only part of it was required for class, I read the whole of it.Rawls' book is important for, among other reasons, being a example of applied ethics relevant to everyone, everywhere, in situations ranging from family politics to constitutional conventions. His approach is substantially Kantian and contractarian, the latter aspect of which should be immediately familiar to citizens of the USA as it represents very much the Enlightenment political theory embodied in the history and theory of American constitutionalism.From the perspective of the class wherein this book was studied, the issue which most exercised the teacher--and, through him, us--was whether or not Rawls fully recognized the economic--indeed, socialist--implications of his assumptions and arguments.",6,1 comment

Against exploitation of the poorest for the benefit of the rich, which is a fair argument. However, he also argues that growth should not happen just for the rich while leaving the poor behind. Too much equalization of opportunity at the tax payers' expense for my liking. His political theory is however integral to understanding the trend of government over the past 50-60 years. Rawls tries to explain and quantify and give name to the theories of justice behind the workings of the time. He calls his theory justice as fairness. ",5,1 comment
