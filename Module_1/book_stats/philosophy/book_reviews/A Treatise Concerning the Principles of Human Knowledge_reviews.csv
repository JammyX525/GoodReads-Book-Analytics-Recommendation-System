159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Jon Nakapalau,"4,743",635,5,"May 18, 2017","Deep end of the pool here! I know I missed much of what Berkeley was trying to say...but his ideas sound like a combination of Zen koans and quantum mechanics - there is an observer who observes everything at all times - it is that continuous observation that lets us (as individuals) observe what we think we are observing (!) (?) Help me, Dr. Sheldon Cooper! You're my only hope!",44,15
159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Xeon,33,258,3,"January 12, 2023","""In vain do we extend our view into the heavens, and pry into the entrails of the earth, in vain do we consult the writings of learned men, and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity; we need only draw the curtain of words, to behold the fairest tree of knowledge, whose fruit is excellent, and within the reach of our hand.""The diagnosis of the problem of knowledge, according to Berkeley, is that of words. True to his statements, Berkeley went so far as to deliberately avoid using the ideas of others and instead use only those ideas and words that were his. I must note here that I sincerely appreciate it when those who espouse a philosophy also act in accordance to it. Diogenes comes to mind here. However, in this case, this was also a bit close minded, which is not a trait that I would typically ascribe to those who acquaint themselves with philosophy.Berkeley points out various issues throughout. For example, the notion of matter involves a contradiction in it, a true idea of something such as motion is impossible, and some ideas are intricately tied to others such as how the idea of pure space exclusive of all body seems impossible. These were in addition to more typical issues such as the multiple uses of languages.The observations on abstracting were what I found to be most useful in this text. Berkeley makes the comparison that for a given truth about the characteristics of triangles ""to be certain this proposition is universally true, we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular triangle, which is impossible, or once for all demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle, in which all the particulars do indifferently partake, and by which they are all equally represented."" This, of course, reminds me of the problem of induction. Interestingly, taking this to an extreme, Berkeley notes at one point how despite the abstract idea of unity being one which can accompany all other ideas, it is not necessarily the most familiar to understanding or perception. In An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke stated that, ""The mind thinks in proportion to the matter it gets from experience to think about."" However, what I found as an interesting yet vital connotation of this made by Berkeley is that this is not only true on an individual level, however that the same could be said at a collective level for the cumulative body of all human knowledge. Berkeley states, ""It is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of human knowledge, that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses, or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind, or lastly ideas formed by help of memory and imagination, either compounding, dividing, or barely representing those originally perceived in the aforesaid ways.""Overall, quite nice. Besides some of the notions on immaterialism and connections to God, there was much that I garnered from this.",35,2
159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Erick,251,237,4,"June 1, 2016","Out of Spinoza, Locke, Descartes, Hume and Berkeley, I certainly found Berkeley the most interesting; but, then, I am into Idealism, so it is to some degree understandable and indicates my bias really. Out of 17th-early 18th century philosophers, Berkeley intrigues me as much as Leibniz does. I might, if I were to expand philosophy to include quasi-mystical writers of the same era, include Swedenborg, Hutchinson, Boehme and Sterry. Berkeley has often been misrepresented as being a philosopher that denied the existence of matter in the sense of real external objects. This is definitely not accurate. Some of his statements are ambiguous and can be wrenched from context and made to look like he supported the non-reality of the outside physical world, but, really, he denied the existence of matter in the philosophical sense of a substrate made up of abstracted accidents and qualities. Like other Idealists going back to Plato, Berkeley believed in a universal Spirit or Mind that necessitates that all reality is perceived and cannot exist apart from this perception. It is an interesting theory when one notes that quantum mechanics supports the notion that reality at the particle level does seem to presuppose an observer. It seems that there may be very current scientific support for Berkeley's supposition on some level. It does seem that in the concluding remarks that Berkeley supports some kind of pantheism; at least, some of his statements appear to strongly support that reading. Pantheism I do not support, so I have some reservations about Berkeley's philosophy, but it is well worth studying at least. It is also interesting that Berkeley appears to have anticipated the pseudo-spiritual abstract philosophy of German Idealists like Hegel; of course, while anticipating it he was also against any such marriage of spirituality with abstract knowledge systems. As it stands, Berkeley was a worth while read and I may revisit this work in the future. ",11,N/A

159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Dan,226,52,5,"May 6, 2021","As an empiricist, Berkeley stayed with perception and went against abstractions and concepts. Ideas are all that matter and they connect only with other ideas. Reality is nothing more than an active spirit perceiving. When we turn our back to things (i.e. ideas) they disappear; or maybe not because other spirits/humans still perceive them or maybe because God, as the absolute spirit, continues to perceive them. Substance (along with shape, movement, colors, and so on) exist only as ideas and as perceptions. If you believe that substance really exists, then you are an atheist or about to turn into one. Starting with the subject-object distinction mainly perpetuated by Descartes, Berkeley completely rejected the object and the rational approach, and developed a perfectly coherent and self-sustaining philosophy. Some of the implications of his philosophy are quite interesting and still relevant today. Great book! ",5,N/A

According to the author's subjective idealism, if you haven't perceived this book it doesn't exist. So if you haven't read it, don't worry. You're not missing anything.",4,N/A

159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Nemo,73,39,4,"March 18, 2018","The Meaning of RealityI was taught from a very young age that reality is what exists independently of human perception and knowledge, and we gain knowledge of reality if and only if our ideas correspond to it. Fantasy is that which has no correspondence in reality, and exists only in the mind of an individual -- unless he communicates his fantasy, others have no way of knowing it.George Berkeley, after whom University of California at Berkeley was named, shows a different way of interpreting reality. He reasons that ideas in the mind can only be derived from ideas in the mind, and not what exists independently of the mind. Therefore, our sense perceptions are signs, not of material substances existing outside the mind, instead, they are signs of ideas which subsist in the mind of God and are communicated to us directly and individually, without ""nature"" as an intermediary. The ""laws of nature"" are not attributes of material substances, but attributes of the inter-relations of the divine ideas communicated to us, like the rules of syntax and semantics in the study of language.Descartes and BerkeleyDescartes is known for the dictum, ""I think therefore I am"". Berkeley's philosophy can be simplified as, ""I think thereby the world exists"". Both philosophers converge on one point: ""I think therefore God is"".Like Descartes, Berkeley started from meditating within his own mind, and saw that the mind is different in nature from the object it perceives -- the former is active and immortal whereas the latter is not. They both inferred the existence of God, by acknowledging the limitation of their mind -- they can only effect and perceive a very small portion of reality, of which a far superior Mind must be the Author.Unlike Descartes, Berkeley denies the reality of matter as an inert substrate with the potential to come into existence by participating in forms. To his mind, matter is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable is non-existent by definition. However, he can't explain the fact that others can conceive it. In addition, he admits that he doesn't perceive other minds from the senses, and must infer their existence indirectly by logic. An argument can be made that the existence of matter is inferred indirectly by logic apart from the senses. Personally I think Descartes is the more logically consistent of the two.(Read full review at Nemo's Library)",3,N/A
159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Justin Rutledge,22,3,4,"October 19, 2017","George Berkeley's Treatise is largely a response to the intellectual storm stirred up by Locke and Descartes, even quoting Locke on several occasions within the Treatise.Berkeley would be described in current philosophical terms as an idealist. The main purpose of his treatise is to show that we are all spirit and reality does not exist outside our perception of it. The world is sustained by God and the perceptions of men. No objects have an ""essence"" or even a ""substance"", they only exist as qualities that we perceive in them.The world according to Berkeley is very ""real"" in the sense that it follows natural laws set by God and may be interacted with by other lesser spirits (men) in a consistent manner, but he rejects entirely the notion of matter.This form of idealism solves many of the tricky philosophical problems with the existence of matter, its interaction with space and time, and the definition of infinitesimals, but I believe it opens up a different (and nastier) can of worms. For example:""33 ... The ideas imprinted on the Senses by the Author of nature are called REAL THINGS; and those excited in the imagination being less regular, vivid, and constant, are more properly termed IDEAS, or IMAGES OF THINGS, which they copy and represent. But then our sensations, be they never so vivid and distinct, are nevertheless IDEAS, that is, they exist in the mind, or are perceived by it, as truly as the ideas of its own framing. The ideas of Sense are allowed to have more reality in them, that is, to be more STRONG, ORDERLY, and COHERENT than the creatures of the mind; but this is no argument that they exist without the mind. They are also LESS DEPENDENT ON THE SPIRIT, or thinking substance which perceives them, in that the are excited by the will of another and more powerful spirit; yet still they are IDEAS, and certainly no IDEA, whether faint or strong, can exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it.""""36 ... There are spiritual substances, minds, or human souls, which will or excite ideas in themselves at pleasures; but these are faint, weak, and unsteady in respect of others they perceive by sense -- which, being impressed upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature, speak themselves the effects of a mind more powerful and wise than human spirits. These latter are said to have more REALITY in them than the former: by which is meant that they are more affecting, orderly, and distinct, and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them. And in this sense the sun that I see by day is the real sun, and that which I imagine by night is the idea of the former.""If the only difference between reality and imagination is the magnitude of ""affection, order, and distinction"", then it makes sense based on Berkeley's premises that our ideas are indeed weak reflections of reality. But this is a one-way sieve. It is clearly evident that our momentary experiences are distinct from our mental recall or reconstruction of them, but why can't we simply imagine an experience with enough order and distinction to become reality? Let's suppose that we take a hip new psychedelic and hallucinate a scene vividly with just as much order and distinction as our sober perception of reality. Does it then become ""real""? Can we actually create the world around us by willing the alterations of our own perceptions so long as they are orderly and distinct? This is the weak link of Berkeley's treatise, and unfortunately also the foundation on which he builds the rest of his arguments.Worth the read if you are interested in understanding one of the influential figures of modern idealism.",2,N/A
159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Ben,113,3,3,"February 20, 2018","The brilliance of Berkeley's philosophy is that it gave David Hume something to improve on, and it opened up whole new areas to doubt and critical observation. These two contributions are staggeringly important to our advancement in my opinion (the fact that the prose is crisp and witty is simply an added bonus). Nonetheless, in the present day Berkeley's philosophy seems fairly bizarre. After all, only a seasoned obscurantist would claim that matter doesn't exist all things (perceptions) that do exist do so in the form of ideas in 2013. This isn't to say many don't try, but Berkeley didn't have cognitive science, cosmology, chemistry, set theory, Einstein's Theory of Relativity, electromagnetism, artificial intelligence, or David Hume to assist his endeavor. For what was known at the time, Berkeley's ideas were unorthodox but prescient. The exaggerated claims of knowledge by natural philosophers at the time needed to be brought down. Berkeley assisted. The subjectivity of reality hadn't been fully realized. Berkeley helped us get there. Language matters, Berkeley noticed. Maybe most importantly, Berkeley partially cleared a path of doubt for Hume to later completely doubt. Nonetheless, Berkeley's philosophy suits his own beliefs too well (infinitely as a useless/chimerical concept, consciousness being an immaterial soul, the existence of an ideal state, the architect of reality as the Catholic God) and doesn't offer the 'clear proof' of god he thinks it does. His clear proof is nullified when the reliability of the ideas inside the human mind are called into question by Hume not too long after. Berkeley gets three stars (plus a half if it were available) because the work is an enjoyable and thought-provoking classic even if the ideas are dated, and although he helped move us forward, some of his ideas are quite obscurantist in nature meaning I can't fall head over heals for it despite my admiration for many of his thoughts.

159994,A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge,Charlie,116,14,4,"October 17, 2008","The body of ideas in this book are communicated quite neatly in Berkeley's introduction, which whether you agree with what he says or not is a really neat rounded little idea. For the most part of the book Berkeley goes through these ideas in much needed greater detail, but he often will repeat the same arguments over and over in a monotonous chant, which towards the end of the book gets very tiresome, as he has failed to see that the true implications of his philosophy are exactly nothing, and should make no difference to Science or our negotiation of what we perceive.",2,N/A

But not in that he does or develops further some of the interesting things Plato did all those years ago. No. He's the 18th century Plato in that he proves amazingly adept at the straw man fallacy, at what amounts to name-calling, and at being a smug prick who is mostly laughably wrong about everything.
