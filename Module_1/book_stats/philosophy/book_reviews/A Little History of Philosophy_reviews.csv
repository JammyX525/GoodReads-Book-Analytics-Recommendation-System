11527504,A Little History of Philosophy,Lucy Whitaker,15,13,5,"December 29, 2011"," I'm a Philosophy student and my teacher recommended this book as she is a fan of Warburton. It's extremely clear and accessible - a true enjoyment for beginners and philosophy veterans alike! I particularly enjoyed how he linked the theories together (Brentham to Mill, Mill to Russell etc) so one could clearly see where each philosopher fit into the grand scheme of things.  Reading this book I also discovered new Philosophers I hadn't come across in my class and my next step is to go onto reading their original works. Warburton's book is a beautiful introduction to new Philosophies and has helped clear up some of the ones I've learned in class. I particularly enjoyed the story of Schopenhauer and the old lady. His philosophy is one I won't forget in a hurry because of how much I laughed at it! Warburton clearly has a passion for the subject and his wide range of knowledge is displayed here for us all to get a hold of. In short, the book is clear, entertaining and wonderful.",68,1 comment
11527504,A Little History of Philosophy,Alec Rogers,73,6,3,"July 5, 2020","Reading Nigel Warburton’s A Little History of Philosophy makes me appreciate even more (if that is possible) EH Gombrich’s A Little History of the World. In about 300 pages, Gombrich relayed just about every event of significance in world history in an erudite, extraordinarily humane way. His book has been in print for so long and in so many languages, it has inspired an attempt to do the same for philosophy. Unfortunately, Warburton’s efforts fall short in many respects, despite providing a delightful entre for true neophytes.A Little History of Philosophy tries to accomplish its task by breaking the development of philosophy up into 40 chapters, each focused on one or two philosophers. Each contains some brief biographical material and a discussion of one or two ideas associated with him or her. After reading A Little History, a reader will know the “big names” and become familiar with some of the more interesting questions and ideas raised over the millennia since Socrates hectored his fellow Athenians about what they really understood and believed. Washburton is careful to illustrate philosophical concepts in a manner that assumes no prior knowledge of philosophy.More specifically, he covers both the famous (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Kant, etc.) and some lesser known figures to the general public (Spinoza, Pierce, Foot, etc.), and includes even the most modern thinkers such as Rawls and Singer. His concept of “philosophy” is broad enough to cover ethics, political philosophy, economic philosophy, theology, ontology, and even some philosophy of science. He generally tries to pair different approaches or variations (e.g., Bentham and Mill on utilitarianism). A true beginner will certainly finish the book knowing a good deal more than she did when she started, is unlikely to be confused, and will likely be inspired to take a “deeper dive” into those topics or philosophers she found most engaging. This is the good news. Those who are even a little better versed in philosophy, however, will find less of interest.Even assuming the book is geared towards beginners, though, Warburton could have done even better in certain respects. He fails to introduce readers to the basic vocabulary of philosophy in many cases. A glossary at the end would be helpful. Opportunities to compare one philosopher’s views on a particular subject with another are sometimes missed. And, in some cases, Warburton chooses a particularly odd concept to discuss in a chapter. For example, a reader will not learn anything about John Locke’s Second Treastise of Government and Locke’s views on the contractual nature of government and the consent of the governed. Curiously, Warburton chooses to focus on Locke’s views on memory and humanity. The political philosophy of Rousseau is well presented, however, and one wishes Warburton had paired him with Edmund Burke in a chapter that covered both views on 18th century political developments. He omits Peter Singer’s most controversial thesis altogether (that perhaps we should permit the killing of severely disabled newborns) despite the point of his final chapter being that philosophy is still a vital force in forcing us to rethink the comfortably familiar. In sum, A Little History is best left to those looking for a gentle introduction to philosophy in general, with readers looking for depth in any particular subject better off elsewhere.",26,5
11527504,A Little History of Philosophy,Wiebke (1book1review),858,502,4,"July 1, 2016",This was an easy to understand and informative overview of philosophers and their ideas. I especially liked how each chapter/philosopher connected to the next. And how despite the amount of information it never felt over my head or confusing.,20,2
11527504,A Little History of Philosophy,Chrissie,"2,647",1486,3,"January 4, 2022","I picked this up as a Daily Deal at Audible!I like this. It is good but it’s brief. Just as the title indicates, the reader gets a LITTLE history of philosophy. It starts with Socrates, Plato and Aristotle and moves forward chronologically to thinkers of modern times. The last to be covered is Peter Singer, an American contemporary who delves into the field of bioethics. Since so much is covered quickly, the reader doesn't get to know any one philosopher well As a result the information doesn't stick, despite that I listened to each chapter multiple times. Maybe this is my fault, bit I feel if you study one philosopher at a time and study that one person in depth, you learn much more.Epictetus and Spinoza were the two philosophers that drew my interest the most. The idea of learning to accept what you cannot change speaks to me. Spinoza's seeing God and nature as the same thing is a definition of God I am comfortable with. Both George Elliot and Einstein felt an affinity to this view too. The author refers back to previously discussed philosophers. In this way comparisons are made and both similarities and differences are pointed out. This is helpful.The audiobook is read by Kris Dyer. The narration is clear and easy to follow. Four stars for the narration.*A Little History of Philosophy 3 stars*The Life of Greece 5 stars by Will Durant",16,5
11527504,A Little History of Philosophy,John Anthony,716,79,4,"May 11, 2021","A gem! 40 bite sized chapters starting with Socrates and Plato and ending with Peter Singer. A ‘notebook’ to keep by me for future use; not to mention the philos volumes referred to here, many of which I want to read. Enjoyable. Light but far from ephemeral. A delight.",9,N/A
