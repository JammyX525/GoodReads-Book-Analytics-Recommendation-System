867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Adil,94,16,2,"August 20, 2011","I read a translation by Ashikaga Yoshiharu and Rosemary Brant. This book puzzled me in that at first glance I seem to have learned nothing else from it than how to hold a sword and attack and enemy, and obvious things like never let your enemy have a chance to recover. I'm definitely missing something, either due to the translation or my inability to read between the lines. I guess I'm supposed to reflect on it and come back to it until I ""get it"" if there's any wisdom in here. The book is full of lines such as ""research this well,"" ""study this thoroughly,"" ""I cannot elaborate on this in writing"" and I'm not sure how these are supposed to evoke any insight in me into anything. Furthermore, the topics are elaborated on very little in this book. I have a suspicion that all those people who rated this book highly have filled in the gap with their imagination. The edition I read presents the book as ""the cornerstone of Japanese Culture"" and I have absolutely no idea how this book played any significant role in Japanese culture; it baffles me. But I guess, as the book says, ""these things are not explainable in detail."" I can say one positive thing about my experience reading the book: It left me using sword battle as an analogy for human relations and that might be useful somehow. ",144,33

There's a lot that could be said here, more than can be included in a ""review"". How can one review a book that has stood the test of 5+ centuries? I think there is much of value here, I think there is much that can be learned and then misapplied by those not wise enough to understand application as well as process.The book assumes that the one reading will have already spent much time in learning and study and plans to move on with the learning. The book's 5 rings can in many ways be looked at as ""headings"" or ""reminders"". These are in many ways outlines of much larger subjects. (1000 days of practice equals 10,000 days or instruction.)There are subjects and views that on the surface seem to to be contradictory. Musashi speaks of ""venerating"" the gods and the Buddhas he then speaks of total self reliance especially not appealing to or depending on the ""gods or Buddhas"". The most commonly used phrase (in translation) is ""this should be investigated thoroughly"".An interesting book that does not claim to supply truth but to help in your finding what is the truth (Musashi would probably add) ""for you"".A book to think about and approach with consideration and hopefully wisdom.

867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Greg,"1,562",78,4,"February 20, 2009","I first read Miyamoto Musashi's The Book of Five Rings many years ago, while I was a Ph.D. candidate in California. I was intrigued by how his nine principles seemd to apply to life in general and leaders in particular, in addition to his intended audience of swordsmen. While it is not as in depth as Sun Tzu's The Art of War, he certainly added to my understanding. His nine principles, from the translation I prefer, are as follows:1. Do not think dishonestly2. The Way is in training3. Become acquainted with every art4. Know the Ways of all professions 5. Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters6. Develop intuitive judgment and understanding of everything7. Perceive those things which cannot be seen8. Pay attention even to trifles9. Do nothing which is of no useAs a set of core principles, these are not a bad way to lead one's life.",60,N/A
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Jonathan,690,74,5,"August 16, 2021","Study, consider, train, examine, observe. The list goes on. This book is a practical guide to life, whether you are in the military or a business person or just an average joe looking to get a handle on life. Musashi lays out in plain language an idea he calls 'The Way.' The purpose of this 'Way' is simple, to ignore all pomp, circumstance, distractions, grandiose displays of prowess and close with the enemy and kill them. Swiftly, without rancor, without a second thought. ""Do nothing which is of no use.""Whether this enemy is a real live one, a competitor, or an obstacle/struggle within your own life, the point is to take control through practice, hard work, perseverance, study, and master that which opposes you through any means necessary. Those looking for free handouts need not apply; those looking for the Western romanticized (Therefore erroneous) view of Bushido need not apply. Musashi explicitly states that in a fight, there is no honor beyond victory. You do whatever you can to throw your opponent off balance, onto their weak hand, blind them, use every advantage you know to utterly remove them from the equation. If you can accept this, you'll never fear a thousand fights.",51,N/A

But I am glad I read it.This book was written by Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese swordsman that had his first duel when he was 13 years old. It is divided into five “rings” (earth, water, fire, wind, void) that describe strategies and principles of martial arts, with a touch of philosophy that kept me interested. Among all the tactics that can be used, he shared his insightful thoughts on several matters. Martial arts are not just about technique. There are some principles to follow; there is a clarity of mind to be reached. You have to be able to find a balance between a world of war and a world of peace.The last ""ring"", the Book of Void... what a way to finish a book. Outstanding.Nov 17, 13* Also on my blog.",46,2

Read this book before I went to boot camp; it really helped me get through it. This book helped me focus on the process of facing adversity in a way that would facilitate personal growth. I tried to reflect on this when I felt like just giving up. Highest recommendation.,38,N/A

There was a modern-day white collar person mimicking ancient Japanese samurai pose. So, I have expectation there was some modern interpretation in business management based on Miyamoto Musashi's teachings.Then I found the book's content was basically translations of ancient text, without much interpretations into modern management style. That's why I rated it only 3 star. The philosophy value itself beyond my own judgment.",25,4
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Robert,816,44,3,"August 23, 2008","This book, written by a famous Japanese duelist, tells one of his relatives how to win with the sword. It is divided into five ""Rings"" based on five ""Elements"". He concentrates on Strategy and does not talk about the best guard to take or other technicalities. Many people find this book to be immoral as it espouses winning at all costs in a deadly pursuit. I regard it more as a-moral. Musashi simply never considers the question. He is simply putting down his concept of Strategy. Perhaps the moral onus is on the reader of the book?Students of Zen would do well to read the book, particularly the final Ring - entitled The Void. Afterward the perceptive student would take up an individual sport - not necessarily fencing, tennis would do just as well - and give up trying to solve koans. After all, even the Masters say that the more you study Zen the further from enlightenment you get and there can be little doubt that Musashi was a master.This translation from the original Japanese also contains an insightful introduction.",16,2
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Vaishali,"1,023",256,4,"August 29, 2015","Called the Go Rin No Sho, this treatise is eye-opening, though at times gruesome. One of the great joys of experiencing older texts is the sheer regality of the narration, so it's overall enjoyable. There are sections which are decidedly male and archaic ... like Musashi's insistence on overwhelming an enemy rather than befriending him. (Quite different from Funakoshi's precept of nonviolence in shotokan karate.)I've included here some striking quotes, and some lists of Musashi's principles.Quotes:--------------------------------------“The way of the warrior is resolute acceptance of death.”“Studying the way of strategy is based on overcoming men.”“Immature strategy is the cause of grief.”“The teacher is as needle, the disciple is as thread.”“It may seem difficult at first, but everything is difficult at first.”“You must study hard.”“You should not have a favorite weapon. To be overfamiliar with one weapon is as much a fault as not knowing it sufficiently well.”“You should not copy others, but use weapons which you can handle properly. It is bad for commanders and troopers to have likes and dislikes. These are things you must learn thoroughly.”""There is timing in everything. All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this.""""Develop a steady spirit.""""The gaze should be large and broad. This is the two-fold gaze, perception and sight. Perception is strong and sight weak. In strategy it is important to see distant things as if they were close and to take a distanced view of close things.""""Generally, I dislike fixedness in both long swords and hands. Fixedness means a dead hand. Pliability is a living hand. You must bear this in mind.""""Alternatively, advance with as strong a spirit as possible, and when you reach the enemy move with your feet a little quicker than normal, unsettling him and overwhelming him sharply.""“Before you embark upon something - before you start - fix your intention on the 4 Oaths, and put selfishness behind you, and you cannot fail.”The 4 Oaths:1. Never be late with respect to the way of the warrior.2. Be useful to the lord.3. Be respectful to your parents.4. Get beyond love and grief; exist for the good of man.There are 4 ways in which men pass through life: 1. Gentlemen, who master various strategies2. Farmers, who produce items from the change of the seasons3. Artisans, who become proficient in tool use4.

If you do not look at things on a large scale it will be difficult for you to master strategy."")1. Do not think dishonestly.2. The Way is in training.3. Become acquainted with every art.4. Know the Ways of professions.5. Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters. 6. Develop intuitive judgement and understanding for everything. 7. Perceive those things which cannot be seen.8. Pay attention even to trifles.9. Do nothing which is of no use.""In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. Both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm. Meet the situation without tenseness yet not recklessly, your spirit settled yet unbiased. Even when your spirit is calm do not let your body relax, and when your body is relaxed do not let your spirit slacken. Do not let your spirit be influenced by your body, or your body be influenced by your spirit. Be neither insufficiently spirited nor over spirited. An elevated spirit is weak and a low spirit is weak. Do not let the enemy see your spirit.""""Small people must be completely familiar with the spirit of large people, and large people must be familiar with the spirit of small people. Whatever your size, do not be misled by the reactions of your own body. With your spirit open and unconstricted, look at things from a high point of view. You must cultivate your wisdom and spirit. Polish your wisdom: learn public justice, distinguish between good and evil, study the Ways of different arts one by one. When you cannot be deceived by men you will have realized the wisdom of strategy.""	 ",12,N/A
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Vik,108,3,4,"September 27, 2007",This book actually has two translations by Thomas Cleary of two books from Japanese martial artists. My thoughts on both and a short comparison are below.The Book of Five Rings is a pretty good insight into a disciplined mind and professional samurai from 17th century Japan. A lot of it is practical advice and there is some spiritual Zen leaning in there too but I would not go as far to say it is required leadership reading material in the same way as The Art of War by Sun Tzu but no martial artist should be without this book.The second translation in the book is The Book of Family Traditions on the Art of War by Yahyu Munenori is far more flowery and makes more sense if you have an understanding of buddhism otherwise the section on existance and non-existance may (or may not be ;-)) be tricky to grasp.In comparision the first book is plainly superior to the second in the manner in which it is written and executed. It's plain talkng and easy to grasp with none of the flowery language prevalent in the second.,11,N/A
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Canon,568,46,4,"July 23, 2022","You Too Can Be a 17th Century Sword MasterEarth | Water | Fire | Air | Heaven | Me Reading This:No, in reality, I appreciated the translator's frank comment in the introduction: ""Because of its concision, the Gorin no sho [Book of Five Rings] is a hard text for contemporary Japanese people to understand. The misunderstandings can only be greater for Westerners, who might draw the impression from the apparent clarity of the text that they are understanding it when in fact the author's essential ideas are eluding them.""As I ranted in my review of the Analects, I hate when translators of abstruse or ancient texts leave contemporary readers to their own interpretive devices to understand or draw something valuable from the text. Thus relying on my ignorance, I learn nothing new or valuable. And so in my estimation, this is a very good edition because the translator does give a lot of helpful yet non-obtrusive commentary throughout. I've no idea about the quality of the translation itself, but I've read it's a good one. I found it very enjoyable to read.I have zero background in martial arts, nor do I anticipate overcoming my laziness to master the art of the sword. I'll sure as hell sit on my couch and watch Inagaki's Samurai trilogy, though. But perhaps I can use Musashi's strategies in my shit millennial life to destroy real world opponents, such as baristas who don't fill my black coffee to the top but instead leave two-thirds of it empty for cream I won't use, or people who doltishly meander in my way whenever I take my ass for a run.",10,N/A
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Brian ,413,5,5,"May 7, 2018","I take online instructions in Wing Chun Kung Fu (https://wingchun.online) and participate in a group on Facebook. I had posted a quote I found from Miyamoto Musashi from a different Wing Chun site. Someone recommended this, The Book of Five Rings, by the author. I responded, “I’ve read The LORD of the Rings; does that count,” to which I found no response, most likely because a humorous response contrasts with the spirit of the work (I guess).  The book, written in 1643, by the undefeated samurai, divides into five scrolls: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Emptiness. He goes into details about sword fighting, which I don’t study yet, but found his teachings inspirational in my studies, with practical advice and wisdom.  I took away a few things from the reading. When you study a martial art, or anything for that matter (like writing), you should focus your mind into it so much that your mind in daily life becomes the way you do martial arts, and martial arts the way you go about daily life. I became more serious in my daily practice after this. I realized that the purpose could save my life, that the art becomes a mode of self-defense, for harming someone who intends to harm you, perhaps even to death. I now practice my “moves” and techniques imagining real people there. That’s not as good as being with a real person or a Wing Chun Dummy (Mook Jong, an advanced practice, with a form), but better than “playing” while watching the Matrix Trilogy again and again, and not getting my mind into the flow of the art. The author advises to focus on the peripheral, to see everything, and not to be distracted by one focus-point. When I’ve been out in questionable areas, I’ve remembered this, and have kept the panorama of my vision before me, to watch and be mindful of potential threats.  He writes that when an enemy has a moment of shock or weakness, or stumbling, take them down, wail on them, don’t let up. This challenged me, provoking mercy in me, and helping me prepare in my heart for the real thing. If you fight, fight- finish it. Don’t hesitate because you may have a break of compassion in the heart. The feeling could cost your life. I learned that martial arts schools will add fancy spins and things that look great, but they do this to make the art marketable, and it has no practical use for the real thing. The “real thing” should be the aim. I’ve thought of that in my practice. When I “freestyle,” a form of “shadowboxing” but with kicks and random attacks against imagined enemy scenarios, I have a habit of dancing, and doing random fancy stuff that makes me feel inflated, like I know something “special.” I’m not blaming my Tae Kwon Do training by any means. I took that art in high school and didn’t take it seriously as I should have. To us (took it with my best friend), we wanted to look like the guys on the movies, even mimicking them, pulling our pants up like them, making our faces like they do at certain times, hopping like they did.  The “real thing” narrows down to simplicity. Get the job done quickly. Survive. Be practical. Resist the urge to feel fancy or to inflate the ego. Get real. Musashi would say the martial arts come down to killing. That must be the focus – a serious matter.",10,2
867247,A Book of Five Rings The Classic Guide to Strategy,Aditi Jaiswal,115,147,2,"April 10, 2020","""I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times” - Bruce Lee. Mastery is far better than curiosity. But what and how to practice? For that you need a mentor, and reading this book will definitely not help you in any way! Unless you know how to read between the lines and you can find the right place to research more on the basic strategic insights! But either way you won't need this book!  I couldn't appreciate it because I have already watched too many movies on martial arts, where I learned a lot about the basic strategies to defeat an opponent that the wisdom of this book seemed obvious to me, considering that the author wanted us to research more on these universal strategies! I read it because Phil Knight ( the author of the Shoe dog) mentioned its name in his book since it helped him to survive the tough phase of his life. But to my surprise, I wasn't able to comprehend the depth and wisdom of *His Way*.So, like the author said, if you want to win a sword fight or defeat an opponent in any field. You have to fight with the spirit of ""one cut"". Though, it is difficult to attain if you do not learn the strategy well. But if you train well in the ways of this book, strategy will come from your heart and you will be able to win at will. But you must research on your own with the few principles mentioned in this book and then train yourself diligently.P.S. - *Perceiving the ability of my pupils, I teach the direct Way, remove the bad influence of other schools, and gradually introduce them to the true Way of the warrior.* This line reminds me of my experience with Indian Coaching system",8,1 comment
