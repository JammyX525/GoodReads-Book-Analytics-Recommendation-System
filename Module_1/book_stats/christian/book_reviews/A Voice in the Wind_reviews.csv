95617,A Voice in the Wind,El,44,4,4,"June 1, 2016","This was my first foray into Christian Fiction and I had very low expectations, anticipating a preachy text with so-so writing and the occasional miracle thrown in. And at times, this book can be all those things. But Rivers' trump card is her characters, and before I knew it I was in love, really in love, with these people. I was shocked at how much I cared, and how quickly. I've enjoyed better writing, and not all of Rivers' points hit the mark for me, but I've come across few characters that I've loved as much as Hadassah. I had to put the down the book at least a dozen times because she made me want to cry - not out of sadness or pity at her incredibly difficult situation, but because she was  so good. I am not easily moved, but she could not have won me over more completely. She is the kind of character that impresses, influences and inspires the reader long after the book has been put down. I found myself looking at my life and wanting to make changes in that way I handle adversity, the way I express love and the way I view sacrifice. For that alone, I have to give this book four stars.

95617,A Voice in the Wind,Kristin (KC),251,25100,5,"May 18, 2015","Nothing less than 5 Stars for this beauty!This is such a breathtaking story--so honest and hopeful and humbling. A Voice in The Wind is a Christian Fiction with religious themes that are heavily pronounced. There's no way around them. Religious beliefs, customs, biblical analysis, and Christian theories saturate this story from top to bottom and every crevice in-between. If that's not your idea of fun, than this one may not work for you. This story is long, over 500 pages, and is slowly paced. Each character represents very specific elements of Christian faith--stemming from its humbled servants, to the self-righteous, to the non-believers, to the down-right evil. The setting is historical, taking place after Jesus' death, right before the rise of Christianity. The plot narrows in on the lives of four characters who will eventually connect. There are brutal moments--slavery, abuse, fight-to-the-death gladiator battles--and there are tender, peaceful moments that are every bit as powerful. Maybe even more so. The writing is beautiful and aids this story to life. There's truly so much depth and meaning to dive into, I couldn't help becoming inspired. There is a romance, a very powerful one, but its progression is quite slow. In fact, every bit of this story moves at a believable speed. When people change and/or recognize the error of their ways, it's a slow process. It's never an instant turnaround--and I loved how this author remains true to that.

Pre-reviewBuddy read with Foxy--who got me to read Redeeming Love 3 years ago (which became a top favorite!), and here we are now finally getting to our 2nd Francine Rivers book.

95617,A Voice in the Wind,Amy | Foxy Blogs,"1,337",963,5,"October 9, 2021","Re-read on 10/9/2021Listening Length: 21 hours 29 minutes.LOVED THIS EPIC BOOKA popular question that gets asked when someone reads a book by a Christian author is- is this book religious?  A simple one word answer would be, “Yes.” It’s written by a Christian writer about a biblical time period. It has biblical principles throughout the story. The story takes place 40 years after Jesus was persecuted. Being a Christian was a scary thing during that time period because if you were found out that meant you would be fed to the lions as entertainment for the Romans. To understand A VOICE IN THE WIND it is important to know a little bit about the four major characters in the story.Hadassah: her family is killed and she's taken from her home and put into slavery. She was born a Jew (being a Jew is both a Nationality and religion) and no one suspects that she is a Christian. She's seen as a non threat because of her plain looks but it’s her inner beauty that draws people to her. She's also Julia’s faithful, humble, and obedient servant. Marcus Valarian: is a wealthy man in his early 20’s. In our modern world we would consider him a manwhore because he has a different woman all the time. He is very handsome and has an air of confidence about himself. Julia Valerian: Marcus’s teenage sister. She’s spoiled, selfish, and vain. Her outer beauty is the envy of many women and catches the eyes of many men. Atretas: a warrior in his country he is taken and made into a gladiator. He’s treated like an animal; caged and forced to fight and kill to stay alive. All this is done for the entertainment of the Romans. He’s fueled by his hatred of Romans and what they’ve done by taking him from his homeland.The beginning of this story is not what will draw you to it. It's like reading the Old Testament where you are learning about the history of what is happening. Once you get past that part... the story takes off. So, if you start the book and feel like maybe this isn't for you because it drags a little just know once you are about a fifth of the way into the book you'll have a hard time putting it down. My all-time favorite book is Redeeming Love which happens to be by this author. I was asked if this book surpasses Redeeming Love as my favorite. Here’s the thing, RL is pure romance...about one couple. While AVITW is about several people and it’s filled with so much scandal that my jaded self loved it.  But I can’t pick which one I love more because it feels like picking a favorite kid and who does that?! But don’t let the words “Christian fiction” hold you back from giving this book a try. This book has: manwhores, backstabbers, murderers, gladiators, schemers, aborters, forbidden romance, and the list goes on.  SERIES:
  

  

  
A continuing story.

    “Have faith… When you have nothing else have faith.”
  
This story was incredible. It was long, but once it hooked me, I didn’t want to stop listening. This book is strongly about faith, specifically the faith of one girl named Hadassha, but it’s also got tons of angst, scandal, drama, violence, and a bit of romance. It’s such an epic book. One of the things I loved most about A Voice in the Wind is that I’ve never read a book quite like it before. It primarily follows four main characters, the first being Hadassha who is a young Christian from Jerusalem who has been taken as a slave in Rome. Her entire family was killed and the family she works for treats her well, mostly. Marcus is the son of the Valarians, who own Hadassha. He’s in his twenties and lives his life with as much women and money as he can stand. His sister, Julia is who Hadassha attends to and let me tell you, Julia is a piece of work. Then there is Atretas, a German warrior who is taken by the Romans and turned into a slave in a different way. He’s forced to fight to the death for their pleasure and he’s never lost a fight. These four individual stories intertwine together in different ways. This book was truly stunning and a story I will never forget. It made me think, made me feel, and at times, made me really ragey, but overall I loved it so much! I’ll definitely be getting to book 2 soon.

95617,A Voice in the Wind,Lady Jane,176,15,2,"December 4, 2013","I have a different perspective than most of the Goodreads reviewers of A Voice in the Wind. An avoider of the romance genre--both Christian and secular--I loved the first part of the book, depicting the fall of Jerusalem and Haddassah's transition to Roman slavery. I previously dispassionately stored in my mind the historic fact that losers in wars became the slaves of their conquerors, but Ms. Rivers' long, emotive description made the horror and depth of that trauma real to me in a manner I hadn't considered. It almost brought tears to my eyes thinking about how many people have suffered this devastation. I also found interesting Ms. Rivers' depiction of Ancient Rome. I appreciated that the way she informed the reader of its depravity without either glamorizing it with too much detail or sanitizing it into a toga-wearing society of butterflies and rainbows by ignoring its corruption. However, when the story devolved into a maudlin romance I began rolling my eyes, losing interest and getting irritated. I recognize that Ms. Rivers was a successful romance novelist before her conversion to Christianity and accept that this professional strength will necessarily inform her subsequent work. It's just not my cup of tea.On a spiritual level, I appreciated Haddassah's struggle with fear in identifying herself as a Christian and sharing the gospel, but found her perfection to be abrasive. What a blessing that Haddassah was able to experience such violent loss and slavery without any emotional damage that hindered her from responding as a perfect Christian in every circumstance! But, then, perfection or near-perfection in heroes and heroines is a staple in the romantic genre.So, A Voice in the Wind was a mixed bag for me. I liked it ok, but I will not be reading its sequel.",45,12
95617,A Voice in the Wind,Amanda (BookLoverAmanda),246,134,5,"October 30, 2022","*editing to write full review* 5 stars. WOW. AMAZING. BEAUTIFUL. FAITH FILLED. Ya'll I literally just finished this 30 minutes ago and I am so in my feels right now. Ditching my TBR and starting book 2 ASAP! I will have to form my thoughts for a formal review later but just want ya'll to know, READ THIS BOOK! Our main character of Hadassah has such strong faith - she inspires me so much. My heart. The ending... I NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!This book is all about Hadassah's faith journey and the people she meets along the way. Hadassah has lost her entire family from the very first chapter - it's heartbreaking, BUT GOD IS THERE WITH HER! The story starts off in Jereusalem when the Romans come in killing Jews and capturing the women for slavery. Hadassah loses her family in this tragedy, between the killings and severe starvation. She is sold to be a roman house slave, hungry and alone. In her journey as a house slave, she never stops praying, talking and trusting God. Her brother told her -- ""remember the Lord"" and thats what she did, every step of the way.The family she is slave to, Marcus, his parents and sister, grow attached to her in many different ways. Marcus' sister Julia is the primary woman that Hadassah tends to throughout the story and many hard things happen along the way. But Hadassah is an amazing Christian girl character who truly shows us what it means to be a Christian in every hardship she experiences.We also follow a side character, Atretes, who is from Germania and captured by the Romans to battle in arenas for sport.As you can see from my initial reaction review, I absolutley adored this story. There are some hard topics and violence in this book - but honestly, its a biblical fiction story that portrays much of what happens in the bible itself. Yes, be aware of the content, but I also understand that it doesnt even touch some of the brutal things that actually occur in the bible itself. I think this book does a phenomenal job of touching our hearts and drawing us close to the Lord. We see what it means to truly forgive and serve others. What it means to be a Christian and believer of the Lord.",38,6
95617,A Voice in the Wind,Ash,382,39,5,"September 26, 2020","first read: May 13 to May 18, 2013first reread: January 6-16, 2016This....book.....I couldn't begin to describe to you the emotions this book brings out in me. Happiness, sadness, disgust, anger, love, joy, terror, hate, heartbreak......I just love this book so much. Its not even this book...THIS author, Francine Rivers....her writing is beyond beautiful, and her 'stories' are not just stories, they are filled, absolutely filled with things that really just, make you think. This story takes place in old Roman times...but there was so much that you could compare with the world today. This is one of those books that many won't want to read, and so they won't, but its definitely one that everyone should read. ",32,8
95617,A Voice in the Wind,MAP,499,142,3,"April 10, 2015","This story follows Hadassah, a Judean Christian brought to Rome after the fall of Jerusalem, Marcus and Julia, two young Roman citizens, and Atretes, a German warrior and chieftain defeated in battle and brought to Rome as a gladiator.The good: This book was head and shoulders above any other Christian fiction I've read, in terms of willingness to write about the seamier things as well as simple writing talent. In general, I was pleased with how the author portrayed Rome. She didn't shy away from the seedier aspects, including the immense of amounts of sex -- all kinds of sex -- that the Romans enjoyed. Too frequently Christian authors get squeamish and try to sanitize history for the sake of their little Christian book, but she really went for it. And not just with the sex, but with the violence of the arena as well. And in general, her history was good, she had a pretty good understanding of how Romans thought, why they disliked Jews as well as Christians, and why they thought both sects were dangerous, crazy, and worthy of being despised and scorned.The bad: Oh, Hadassah. You little stereotypical Christian heroine Mary Sue. She drove me nuts. She was so damn perfect. In fact, her one flaw, as portrayed in the book, was that she DIDN'T go around proclaiming for love for Jesus to everyone she met. Frankly, I did not find this a flaw. I found this her one redeeming feature to her otherwise sickeningly sweet personality. Ugh, Hadassah, so uselessly twee. Julia had the opposite problem -- she too was rather flat though in the other direction. You can tell the author tried to give her a character arc, but it doesn't quite scan....she seems to jump from personality to personality without much motivation or exploration.The Ugly: Ok, first and foremost...well, there wasn't much of a plot. Things just kind of happened, and then other things happened, and then, look! More things! They happened! But none of it never seemed to lead anywhere. Maybe this is because it's part of a trilogy, but each book needs to feel somewhat complete within itself. A book should not be 500 pages and yet have no plot. Second, the author got a couple of historical facts really really wrong. First, Romans did not have a sense of heterosexuality and homosexuality like we do. There were only 2 roles: pitchers and catchers. Roman male citizens were always pitchers, women and slaves were always catchers. While a Roman male would be scorned for being buggered BY another male, as long as he was the one doing the schtupping, it didn't matter whether it was a male or female. Romans viewed it the same. Second, she got her history on abortion all mixed up. First, there actually WERE laws against abortion (she has a character say there's not one) but it was not homicide -- it was viewed more as theft against the father (or master, if the pregnant woman was a slave) because he lost a potential investment. Second, the Romans never questioned whether fetuses were ""babies"" or not, they took the Greek view of thinking of fetuses as more plant-like until they drew breath. Also, Hadassah's reactions about all these things were ridiculous. Anyone who grew up in that era would have been inured to these things, whether they agreed with them or not...why is she acting like all this stuff is brand new information? No.Considering this was written pre-internet, I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt of not being able to readily find this rather obscure information, but I still resent her shoe-horning a modern issue onto a plot-device that made NO SENSE historically. I still haven't decided whether I'm going to read 2 and 3. They focus more on Marcus and Atretes, both of whom I liked WAY more than Hadassah. Still, I'm afraid we haven't seen the last of her, and I don't want to read 1000+ more pages of no plot.",26,12
95617,A Voice in the Wind,Baylie Clagg,32,25,5,"November 4, 2022",After taking a couple of days I finally feel like I can give this a worthy review after processing my thoughts. I’m not going to say a whole lot other than this: This book is heavy and has hard topics but that’s also how life is. This book is raw and real and so is life and the hardships we go through. The characters ask questions about faith that are challenging but honest. The story of salvation and what it means to truly serve is evident. Not just in how we serve others but to serve God with your whole heart & then what flows from it when you take the posture of faith and obedience before the Lord. It’s just so moving and such a strong message. I could easily reread this and get even more from it. The way this story stirred my heart for the Lord is overwhelming. I think everyone should at least try and read this story. I’m not a historical fiction reader at all but the faith & love for God this book represents far surpasses any of my “dislikes” when it comes the historical fiction genre. This book may not be for everyone but it sure has me reflecting upon my own life and what my personal walk with the Lord looks like ❤️,18,N/A
95617,A Voice in the Wind,Jamie,283,3,5,"January 26, 2008","I LOVE THIS SERIES! Francine Rivers has done amazing things in these books. What an inspiring character! I just kept finding myself wanting to be like Hadassah. It's hard to love others like Jesus did...more than myself. I am all the time reminded of my shortfalls and selfishness. But, Hadassah reminds me of many of the characters in the Bible. I am amazed by the tough choices that she makes and wondered if I could do the same thing in similar circumstances. The historical aspect of the book is interesting as well, around the time of the fall of Jerusalem. I have never read a fictional novel that changed my life...but this one did. ",17,3

95617,A Voice in the Wind,Anna,16,15,1,"November 21, 2012","This book was recommended to me by a friend, who described it simply as “historical fiction”. This is normally a genre I enjoy and I really, really tried to like it. I didn’t realize Francine Rivers was a Christian writer and I am an atheist down to the ground.I nearly didn’t make it past the first 10 pages for that reason. With barely a paragraph that didn’t mention “God” or “the Lord” I struggled to get into the book. I continued to read as I thought I shouldn’t be put off just because the book has a strong Christian perspective.The only thing I can say for Francine Rivers is her writing style isn’t awful. She is clear and not really boring, although she does have certain expressions that she returns to incessantly. But her writing is not creative or poetic to make this a literary experience.The story was quite interesting, some of the scenes were well captured – for example to Roman mob and the decadence and hedonism of that era. I also liked the concurrent telling of the story from different perspectives. I really liked the flow from one character’s perspective to another’s in the same scene, although sometimes it was done clumsily.I wasn’t impressed with any of the characters. All of them can be summed up in one line. Hadassah struggles to maintain her faith in God through a series of trials, both horrible and tempting. Marcus is a hedonistic young man who gradually begins to realize the error of his ways. Julia is a headstrong and selfish young woman who slides down a slippery slope into moral degradation. Atretes turns away from his convictions due to pragmatic concerns until he becomes the image of what he despises. There really isn’t much more to them. All the characters fit precisely and unambiguously into their roles. You love Hadassah because she is perfect. You hate Julia because she is evil. You have hope that Marcus will become a better person. You lose hope of Atretes finding his way to happiness.For a main character, I found Hadassah boring. She didn’t even really seem to have a personality. She grieves over her slave masters in a way she never really seemed to grieve for her mother, sister or brother. She continually reflects about her father (who brought her close to God) but never seems to dwell that much on most of the rest of her family, especially not her brother who was stabbed in a misguided effort to protect his sisters. She battles with her faith but I couldn’t really feel her emotions. Her total dependence on God seems to make her empty of anything human. I was very surprised when her love for Marcus was mentioned. It was not something that I saw even hinted at or that may have been quietly growing from a certain seed. We see the development of his regard for her – but hers for him seemed to come almost out of nowhere. What I really disliked about this book were the contrived situations set up to preach Christian ideals. Julia’s abortion and the murder of her husband are done in such a way that both acts are absolutely wrong and evil. There is no way to have sympathy for Julia – the decisions she makes are wrong and even though she is tormented by guilt we feel no pity for her. You can not; she has no redeeming quality, no generous or compassionate thoughts, no sincere remorse. She carelessly allows herself to be led astray by others and her own selfishness.She is a weak character but I think her portrayal is monstrously unfair. Her rapid decline from being an undutiful daughter and wife to a murderer is quite incredible – it seems a little extraordinary that being a disobedient teenager could lead so swiftly to a complete absence of any moral integrity. It just seems unrealistic and contrived. The other thing that bothered me is that I don’t agree that a single principle is always correct in every situation. For example, I wonder what would have happened if Hadassah had been raped and then considered an abortion, to save her child from being born into slavery? What if Julia had managed to kill Caius in self-defense? What if Hadassah had done so to save her mistress? Ethical issues are complex and deserve to be treated as such. This book doesn’t deal with the difficulty of making that right choice with the circumstances that exist – apparently somehow God will show you the way. Or not, if you don’t have faith.What also seemed contrived were the constant parables between Roman life and the modern day. Decimus and Phoebe are the heads of a normal family, struggling to raise their children with a good moral compass. They have trouble relating their values to their children growing up in a new generation. They even have a rebellious teenage daughter! Rivers somehow manages to drag in every kind of issue that people today might face; how to raise your kids, how one must deal with an illness and death in the family, questions of inheritance, what if you don’t like or approve of your child’s spouse or friends etc. I can appreciate she wants people to be able to relate to this story but sometimes the similarities are so belaboured it’s implausible. Naturally people have struggled with their families and their lives and trying to do the right thing forever – but if you want to write a book about how faith relates to modern problems, set your book in a contemporary age.I was really disappointed with this book. After a got past the first chapter, it wasn’t difficult to continue reading, but there weren’t any parts that I really enjoyed and plenty that made me cringe.",16,3
95617,A Voice in the Wind,Marquise,"1,660",219,2,"November 20, 2017","What MAP said here I second, and would also add one more observation of my own about a historical inaccuracy of note few if any seem to be noticing: the misnoming. It bugged me so persistently that it made hard to enjoy or concentrate on reading.The Roman naming system consisted of a praenomen (first name), a nomen (name of the gens), and a a cognomen (second or additional family name), and in some cases a fourth name was added (agnomen). Only males were named this way. Women in Rome got their names from the feminine version of the father's nomen, ofttimes the feminine of the cognomen was added as well. For example, if your father was called Quintus Caecilius Metellus, you would be called Caecilia Metella. In rare cases, the name of a prestigious ancestor on the mother's side would be used together with the feminine of the father's name, case of Pompeia Sulla, daughter of Pompeius Rufus and Cornelia Sulla, who was granddaughter of Lucius Cornelius Sulla.So . . . now that the historical facts are laid on the table, can anyone please explain why does Francine Rivers flout this well-established and well-known historical fact in this trilogy of hers? And not just for the females. The protagonist's name is Marcus Lucianus Valerian, which is fine enough, but why is then his father called Decimus Vindacius Valerian? Why does Marcus not carry the same nomen as he should? And why exactly is his empty-headed sister called Julia? The family's name isn't Julius, they couldn't call her so. She would be named Vindacia, maybe, and Marcus should also be Vindacius, and Julia would be acceptable only as a nickname. But it isn't, it's her real name in this book. To add to the blatant ignorance, Rivers repeats the mistake all over the trilogy with other characters, giving the name of Octavia to the daughter of a certain Drusus, to add one more example.And to make it worse, she uses a modern naming convention that was non-existent in Rome: she has the women of the family of Decimus Vidancius Valerian carry the name Valerian as if it were their surname. Phoebe, the Greek wife of Decimus, is called Phoebe Valerian repeated times just as a married woman would adopt the husband's name in our day. And Julia is also often called Julia Valerian. All of which is incorrect.Frankly, as a sentimental and mawkish piece of fluff it may have its entertaining value, but it's so poorly researched I find it's not worth investing more of my time in reading the rest of the trilogy, so I'm going to stop here.",16,18

95617,A Voice in the Wind,DW,473,5,1,"April 13, 2013","I am flabbergasted that this book gets so many positive reviews. The writing is so bad that I can't believe the book was even published. Maybe it's not fair to compare this book to masterpieces like The Color Purple or All the King's Men, but I can find stories for free on the internet that are written better than this. (For example, why describe a direct quote as ""terse""? You just told me the whole quote! And surely no book needs the word ""sardonic"" in it ten times.) I didn't fully appreciate what a ""flat character"" was until I read this book - even the main characters are as well rounded as a sheet of paper. And even though I am notorious as not predicting plots, I could predict this one. The young Roman master can't sleep, walks out to the garden, and finds ... wait for it ... his new slave girl, praying! Nobody saw that coming!The only reason I kept reading was for the incidental information I picked up about Rome, and I'm taking that with a grain of salt. Despite the author's attempt to be historically accurate (I'm assuming) by using the Latin names for garments, parts of the house, and the bath, I'm pretty certain the book is filled with anachronisms. I haven't done research, but I find it hard to believe that a slave would alternate between calling her master ""my lord"" and using his first name. And okay, the target audience for this book is probably not familiar with mixed martial arts, but the descriptions of fights border on nonsensical. I would like to point out that when a person is choked unconscious, his vision doesn't blur, it gets black around the edges. Getting that correct doesn't even require personal experience (ahem), a simple Google search is sufficient.As at least one other reviewer has noted, for a Christian book, this is not exactly edifying. Only Hadassah is Christian, and she spends most of the book being distressed at the actions of all the other characters as they go about being as debauched as humanly possible. Descriptions of unlikeable characters frittering away their lives at games and parties quickly get old, and I can point to several non-Christian books with much better (and more believable) role models. I'd give this book zero stars if possible.",15,8
