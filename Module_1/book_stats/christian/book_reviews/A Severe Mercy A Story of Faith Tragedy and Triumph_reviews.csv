56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,booklady,"2,167",65,5,"March 3, 2009","A Severe Mercy can almost be called a foreshadowing of A Grief Observed. But of course that is only from our perspective looking back on the four lives involved. Sheldon Vanauken wrote A Severe Mercy about the love of his life, Jean ""Davy"" Palmer Davis. It's a beautiful love story, one of the most idyllic I've ever read, perhaps too idyllic, but poignant and breathtaking all the same. The book traces their relationship from courtship through the early pagan (the author's term) years of marriage to the meeting and eventual friendship with C.S.Lewis who was instrumental in their eventual conversion to Christianity.While I enjoyed the book very much, as a woman and a mother, I did constantly wonder (as I read the book) at their decision not to have children. The author announces this fact early on in their pagan years which the couple dubbed, ""The Shining Barrier"", presumably a barrier of love which they erected around themselves to protect themselves from the outside world. Later, however, when they converted to Christianity, there was no mention they ever revisited this decision. Davy was still young enough at the time to bear children. I couldn't help thinking and wondering if -- as time went by -- the desire to become a mother didn't occasionally tug at her heart. Vanauken never mentions it and at the end of the book he describes burning her diaries. In an interesting aside however, Lewis does chastize his friend, and very severely too, for the couple's decision to exclude children from their marriage, but only some time after Davy's death. Two of the many delights in this book are numerous beautiful poems the author wrote to his beloved bride and a large collection of letters from C.S. Lewis.An excellent autobiography of Love. Beautifully written tribute to Davy as well; I only wish I heard more of her voice.",43,7
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Debbie Petersen Wolven,252,98,1,"August 17, 2008","In Dress Your Family In Corduroy and Denim, David Sedaris tells of a time he was at a movie with his partner, Hugh. They were watching The End of the Affair, and Hugh was completely taken by the drama and was weeping. David, bored, whispered, ""I can't wait until she dies."" Hugh was aghast.I had heard that A Severe Mercy was about a married couple, madly in love, and that thier faith and marriage are tested by the wife (Davy) converting to Christianity and therefore loving God more than her husband, and her subsequent illness and death. I personally did not find their initial love story endearing, I thought it stifling. They decide that they would spend all of their time together, and if one had interests that the other did not share, the uninterested party had to go along and take part anyway so that there would be no secrets. They write each other annoying poems and call each other cutesy names, ad nauseum, and then they decide to both explore Christianity together and start by reading C. S. Lewis' books. The husband finishes one of the books and writes a letter to Lewis, who writes back. On that point I am wild with envy. Davy is far ahead on the spiritual walk and eventually leaves the husband behind, who makes a profession of faith of sorts shortly after. Now their annoying story includes going to church, holding Bible studies and singing hymns in the night. At this point in the story I invoked David Sedaris, paging ahead to when she will become sick and die, since I was hoping at that point the story would become more interesting. It did not. If anything, it became even more trite and maudlin. After she finally dies, Sheldon imagines what would have happened had Davy lived, and surmises that either their love would have died, or he with his lesser faith would have dragged Davy down and made her less of a believer. Therefore, God showed his ""severe mercy"" in taking Davy, thereby preserving their love for all eternity and also calling Davy home while her faith is strong. HUH?Am I the only person on Goodreads who found this book to be a complete disappointment, despite the fact that letters from C. S. Lewis are included in the narrative?",39,18
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Trish,"1,043",19,2,"September 6, 2016","I struggled with this book. I really enjoyed the letters from C.S. Lewis, but Vanauken's writing - and even his story in general - left me cold. There were a few well-written passages, but overall he was far too wordy and his descriptions of his virtually perfect wife and their life together seemed ridiculous, and finishing the book was not a joyful endeavor. He reminds me of that guy you avoid at functions - he's got some good stories, but he talks on far too long and has a very high opinion of himself and all he's accomplished.I finished the book with a sigh of relief. And then I started wondering whether he was truly even a Christian. He makes a declaration of faith, but never seems to fully commit. As he's grieving his wife's passing, he comes to realize that perhaps her death was good thing in that he never attempted to ""damage or lessen her commitment to God"" - but earlier in the book he admits to being jealous of the time she spends reading her Bible, and I cannot think she was unaware of this.Bottom line, I'm really glad it's over. I cannot think of a single circumstance that would ever make me recommend this book to another person. Please just read the quotes shared by others and move along...Read for Modern Mrs. Darcy 2016 challenge - book that you own but have not read",16,N/A
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Brice Karickhoff,491,30,5,"February 10, 2020","This was one of my top 5 favorite books I have ever read. It won’t be that way for everyone, but for my particular taste, it was nearly the perfect book. For the second time this month (Gulag Archipelago being the first) I feel entirely incapable of writing a review to do justice to this book. And this time, I basically won’t even try. This book tells the story of a couple who falls in love with each other, then with Jesus years later, and then faces tragedy. The book is written by the husband, who also happens to be good friends with CS Lewis. From a literary perspective, this book is absolutely beautiful, articulate, and at times, poetic. From an emotional perspective, you will feel unbelievable heights and depths alongside the author (I shed a tear). From a spiritual and wisdom standpoint, it is illuminating on topics such as longing, joy, and earthly and heavenly love. I can’t say enough about this book, and with this review, I am certainly not saying enough. Just pick it up and read it yourself. Maybe you too will feel that it’s so good that it’s not even worth trying to review.",12,1 comment
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Elizabeth Moore,142,28,5,"August 6, 2017","Severe mercy. That’s a rather chilling way to describe something containing so much hope and freedom.  Mercy can often be misunderstood, thrown down and trampled upon by our raw emotions. How can something so good cost so much? Isn’t mercy the act of setting free; a pardon from a much deserved punishment? Why then this sting? Could it be that mercy comes at a high price? Perhaps. And if so, does it come at the expense of the giver or the receiver?  I’m not here to answer these questions. I would have to have a lot more wisdom than my 19 years allow. But I can point you to a memoir revered as much as any work by C.S. Lewis, Chesterton, or Spurgeon. A Severe Mercy by Sheldon Vanauken, recounts the life of Van and his wife Jean Davis, or Davy: the places they go, the people they meet, the faith they want to reject, and the transformation they undergo at the cost of a very severe mercy. On the entirety and depth of this book, The Washington Post comments, “No brief review can do justice to the human depth of this book.” I fully agree. This corner of the Collegian is merely an invitation to delve in and see for yourself the depth that is so incomparable. If my attempt to scratch-the-surface resonates at all within you, do yourself a favor and read the entire book. A Severe Mercy tells the story of two real people, Van and Davy, whose paths first cross in a New York Department store where Davy works and where Van is a scatter-brained college student. Unable to resist her “beautiful, wide-spaced eyes”, Van promptly asks Davy out on a date at his first opportunity. This snowballs into an inseparable relationship dedicated to discovering the secret of “inloveness” and beauty.Van and Davy have always considered themselves agnostics, but the more they seek to deepen their love, the more they begin to believe in a creator of order and beauty. After his time as a soldier in WWII, Van reluctantly decides to re-visit this absurd notion of Christianity he abandoned in his childhood. This decision would change the course of his and Davy’s life forever.  The couple moved to England after World War II to study history and literature at Oxford University. To their surprise, they meet Christian friends who actually possess wit and intelligence, one of whom was the famous teacher and author, C.S. Lewis. Van wrote to C.S. Lewis of his doubts and questions while he battled between faith and reason, desire and belief.  After a long season of searching for proof and finding unexpected answers, Van and Davy “made the rather chilling realisation that [they] could not go back” (98). Before coming to Oxford, they had neither accepted nor rejected Jesus because they had never encountered Him. But now they had. At this realization, Van exclaims in one of his letters to Lewis, “My God! There is a gap behind me, too.” Even the possibility of the validity of Christianity created a gap they did not expect. The middle ground they had stood on comfortably for so long was slowly sinking. Now that they had encountered the Gospel, they must choose to accept or reject. There were two gaps. One in front, one behind. And so they jumped. They made the choice to believe.  For some of you, you may be turned off by the detailed sentimentality of Vanauken’s writing style. Others may be overwhelmed by the perfectly blended paradox of mystery and clarity. And yet within all of us, something either comes alive or tenses up. There are no directions to this part of your soul, but something about the story triggers movement there. It triggered me.  It leads me to the realization that the Gospel demands a response. It demanded a response from Van and Davy, and it demands a response from us. Once we’ve encountered the possibility that Jesus is God and died for all, we’re faced with a choice--required to respond. The middle ground ceases to exist and we must either face the gap behind or the gap ahead and leap.  So read with caution. The Lord has made a way of mercy, but it is not without severity. It is beautiful and good beyond comprehension, but it demands a response that will cost everything. ",10,N/A
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Sarah,5,7,5,"May 6, 2007","This book is amazing. Anyone who has really loved someone, or aspires to real love will take so much from this. It also has some beautiful things to say about grief and loss. Poetically written and so inspired!",7,1 comment
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Beth,50,2,4,"August 24, 2007","The first half plus of the book I found enchanting and enriching. It was eye-opening to me as an on-looker at the beauty of relationships between man and woman, of the mystery of God’s drawing grace and penetration of skepticism (with some real kickers from Lewis about the threshold or leap of faith…see pg. 88). There is true depth and a special resonance with much of Vanauken’s musings for me, such as his thoughts of beauty. It seems to strike a human tone—many things in his book. After Davy’s death, some of his thoughts were beyond my experience and not as enthralling. These included his philosophizing of what would have happened if Davy had not died, etc. At times I felt cheated, since he seemed to rely on Lewis’ name; at times I felt like a buyer being coaxed into a business deal I wasn’t interested in. But nonetheless, the final chapter about the “second death” of grief itself dying was a fascinating and deep journey for me. I find the book overall an excellent read, especially for my season in life. Should I ever grieve, which someday I truly will, this should be a comfort, though a painful one, perhaps. ",6,N/A
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Gail,20,3,4,"January 6, 2011","I was given this book after the sudden death of a good friend. Anyone who has loved and lost will relate to Sheldon, an incredible writer and observer, and have difficulty not shedding a few more tears. Sheldon got to a depth of feeling and humanity that I didn't expect in expressing love. I think many would be jealous of a couple who managed to stay in the summer of their love for 15 years and wish for their own ""Shining Barrier"" to ward off anything that would harm love's growth. Fans of C.S. Lewis would enjoy his friendship with the couple and his instrumental influence in them finding truth. Oh, and I really want to visit Oxford and go sailing now. ",6,N/A
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Talia Karickhoff,58,6,5,"February 11, 2020","This book is a beautiful love story, speaking to what love truly is. Sheldon and Davy are simple but also unique, adventurous but also traditional. There story is full and good and Sheldon writes of it beautifully. This book hit hard emotionally. Sheldon writes of feelings and thoughts so eloquently and honestly in a way I connected with deeply. I felt as though I was experiencing and learning with him! A quote that I particularly loved and I think captures the book: “At all events, joy flowered between us, the joy that I had thought to be pagan joy. After all, for Christian and unbeliever, there is but one spring of joy.”",6,N/A

56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,Joanna Mounce,63,4,5,"February 7, 2017","This book is a memoir of a widower who recounts his marriage and conversion to Christianity. While perusing the reviews, I noticed a lot of people mention that they hated the author, and I giggled because I felt the same way. However, I still wanted to give it 5 stars because I loved the book despite the messenger. The book opens with the author visiting his family manor and reflecting on his dead wife, and right from there you can tell he is an annoying rich man. Him and his wife live on a yacht for much of the book, and that is irritating, and then they just pick up and go to Yale like it's so easy. Then they up and go to Oxford! Do rich people really have such easy lives? I wanted to punch someone. They also have this sickening relationship where they share everything. Like, they read every book the other person has ever read, or they wake each other up in the middle of the night for water, just to give the other person the pleasure of serving them. They choose not to have children because it might draw them apart since the wife will feel closer to the child. There is a scene where the wife teasingly tries to hide a conversation between women from the husband, and he brings her to tears saying it's over if she hides even something trivial. Truly vomit-inducing.Wait? Was this a 5-star review? Oh right! So, despite all that, the couple makes it to Oxford and fall in with some Christians. Although I still disliked the characters at that point, the intellectual life they lead at Oxford was inspiring for me. They read great books and poetry and just wanted to discuss it all the time, like life in an AP English class. Eventually they go through a lot of reading that leads them to accept Christianity, despite having turned up their noses at it prior to that. The wife converts first, then the husband converts after reaching out to a professor at Oxford, C.S. Lewis. The husband and C.S. Lewis become friends, and Lewis's letters are published throughout the book. So I guess I loved this book because it involved intellectuals humbling themselves to accept Christianity and because my favorite author of all time featured a prominent role. There's even an amusing part where he finds himself thinking ""How can I believe this cock and bull story?"" and he and Lewis laugh about that feeling. Also, Lewis eventually admonishes the author for that sickening yacht phase, which the author also comes to see in a different light. As the author himself points out: there's an element of hubris and catharsis in this book that is reflective of Greek tragedies, and overall I feel like a better person for having read it.",5,N/A
56594,A Severe Mercy A Story of Faith Tragedy and Triumph,David West,19,1 follower,5,"May 29, 2020","I haven’t read many memoirs, but I can’t imagine many being as moving as this book. There are so many dimensions to it that I think so many readers would enjoy. It’s a conversion story, it’s a confession, it’s the story of a friendship, it’s a story of loss, and of moving on in Love. There is wisdom in every page and the letters from CS Lewis are dripping with wit. I think those letters alone could convert a curious non-Christian!Overall it’s amazing: a bit slow at times, but a short read so I suggest you pick it up!",5,N/A
