112872,A Light in the Window,Rhonda,331,50,4,"May 26, 2011","While I have no doubt that I am not going to read the whole series, I picked up two when I was at the library and the second dutifully begins where the first leaves off. Someone commented that these are the types of books which little old ladies read when they feel like they can put their collective noses into other people's affairs. If one hasn't read these books, that's a pretty good assessment, which is to say that it is totally incorrect. While Jan Karon has a huge following, no doubt composed in part of little old ladies, these stories are anything but what they appear to be on the outside. While the excitement is of a far more subtle sort, it is extremely human... as well as Christian. Without preaching, it successfully delivers the method of the utmost simplicity, something of which I think our Father would approve. It takes a while to become used to reading these, especially when you are expecting something exciting and dangerous, but what you end up with is that people are real and they solve their issues in very real ways. These are funny, inviting and joyful books of the Christian faith, and without too much of a stretch, I would probably say that they were inspired also. They are works of grace and beauty also, but that takes a while to see, if you are a complicated person with a complicated life. It makes you wonder why we made our lives so complex in the first place...and what we missed when we did so.",71,9

This is the story of a middle aged (maybe late middle-age?) clergyman in a small town. Again I came over these when i was listening to books and reading whatever I could get my hands on it seemed and I was surprised how involving these were. I hate soap operas and these books (except possibly for the ""Wedding Book"" which i couldn't get through) don't ""slump"" into soap opera mode. I like most of these and that truly surprised me.Timothy and the other characters here will I believe appeal to a wide audience. Life lessons, love with ""work clothes on"", human relationships and plots. Pretty good.",23,2

There's no heavy drama, no shocking twists, no explosive ending. But it's every bit as charming and engrossing as all the other books I gave five stars to. I think it's simply impossible to read it and not fall in love with the characters. They are warm, friendly, happy people, and they love and take care of each other. Edith Mallory is a bit too annoying at times, but she provides all the necessary additional spice to the storyline. And I love Cynthia's candor and independence. I think Father Tim took too much time pondering where the relationship was headed but still, all's well that ends well. And that Dooley Barlowe? I have to say he's a total star. I love and adore him.

112872,A Light in the Window,Margie,397,1 follower,4,"July 18, 2020","4.5 starsBook #2 in Jan Karon's Mitford series continues the saga of Father Tim and the trials, tribulations and triumphs that he faces daily in his life.Over the years I have returned several times to the Mitford series because of the comfort it offers me.  Mitford is an idyllic small country town with wonderful characters and devoid of the stress of big city living.  However, this is not to say that Father Tim does not have stress in his life.  As these books continue, one stress is replaced with another.  The life of a small village vicar is not stress free, nor is it easy.Many people shelve this series as ""Christian literature"" and for some reason or another I have never placed it in that category.  To be sure, Father Tim quotes plenty of scripture - especially to his big floppy dog, Barnabus (the only way to keep Barnabus from jumping on you is to quote a verse from the Bible; amazingly, Barnabus immediately sits or lies down upon hearing scripture.  Barnabus is also fond of Wordsworth!)  Even though scripture is quoted, it is not proselytizing.  This series is about how the life of a sixty year old stressed out, worn out priest, was infused with new spirit and energy when a dog, a boy and a new neighbor entered his life.  It is also about kindness, love and caring neighbors who look after each other.  Who wouldn't want to live in Mitford!The characters in this series will blow your socks off!  How Jan Karon came up with so many wonderful names, characters and dialogue amazes me.  I do know that she lived in Blowing Rock in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina for a number of years and that Mitford is loosely based on Blowing Rock.  I would love to visit Blowing Rock someday.  The village is indeed idyllic; the characters charming, quirky and lovable.  However, as the series continues, Father Tim's life, even though more and more fulfilled, also becomes more and more stressful.  These books give me new appreciation for the busy and often stressful life of a parish priest, especially a kind, empathetic and giving priest like Father Tim.Wonderful writing and a great escape from the present world.  Even if we can't travel anywhere right now, I highly recommend a visit to Mitford!",15,12
112872,A Light in the Window,Laura,734,265,4,"August 14, 2022","I’ve read this book more than twice! Not sure how many times, but I enjoy it every times. Been enjoying rereading these with my sister. She may be enjoying them even more than I do, a huge win for this book lover’s heart ❤️ <><><>4.5 stars. This may be a Father Tim year. I love these characters so much, and they get better with time. So many laughs and smiles inside this one. This is another reread, and relisten. The audio performances of this series are terrific. The narrator becomes the characters. He changes voices convincingly for each one, and it was a joy to listen. If you've ever wondered what it must be like to be the pastor of a small parish, where people really walk their faith out, and look after each other, and especially if you need a smile, this is the series for you. There is some drama, but it's always understated, no sex or violence, great animal characters, a boy growing into a man who will steal your heart, etc. All of these characters will steal your heart! Highly recommended. And moving on to number three.",15,4
112872,A Light in the Window,Carol Bakker,"1,126",76,5,"April 16, 2018","This is a tender book, a romance in the best, most elevated sense of the word. Father Tim and Cynthia's love for each other is expressed; but what to do about it is one of the conflicts of the story. Chapter Seven, letters written to each other, is pure gold. Light illuminates this book — glowing in the window, flickering in the fire, falling on the wood floor, entering the room with Puny, guiding a searching man, shining at the Lord's Chapel, infusing the valley, warming Timothy and Cynthia. It is a wondrous book to read when winter doldrums and spring-snow dim the natural light.",9,1 comment
112872,A Light in the Window,Jerry,"4,614",54,4,"January 27, 2019","Jan Karon continues her charming small-town series with this second volume, which is touching at times, and heartbreaking at others, but also includes a dash of humor. While you'll likely see the ending coming a mile away--I know I did--it still made for enjoyable reading.",8,N/A
112872,A Light in the Window,R.F. Gammon,457,171,3,"February 22, 2018","This one is my least favorite of the Mitford books (at least the original nine), although I still adore it. It just feels less like coming home and more like a stop on the way. That is not a bad thing, at all! I still absolutely recommend this series...and this book...this particular installment simply feels a little bit melodramatic at times. That may simply be my opinion, however. The third one is one of my all-time favorite books, so I can't wait to get to that one! ",7,4
112872,A Light in the Window,Haley Annabelle,200,28,3,"July 23, 2021","I definitely see why people like these books. They’re just sweet enjoyable books. But nothing stands out to make them super amazing. Favorite quote: “Scared to step forward, terrified to turn back” ",6,N/A
112872,A Light in the Window,Beth,775,314,4,"October 5, 2020","I loved being back in Mitford! Like the first book, this felt like a slower read, but I never really minded that aspect of it. It’s not a bad thing, it’s more a part of the appeal.My favorite part is the relationship between Father Tim and Dooley. They’ve come a long way even since the first book.",6,3
112872,A Light in the Window,Kelly,"3,061",31,2,"April 11, 2010","I'm going to write the same thing for the entire series. It's a syrupy sweet old fashioned read which does not demand anything of the reader. Many find the series feel good, and there are some sparkles of true conflict here and there, but mostly it's about the mundane daily plight of a vicar who finds love later in life and saves people - emotionally and physically. If you like the first in the series, keep reading because you will be comforted by the characters and will want to see who is added to the ""family."" This reads like it was made for a TV series, which I am surprised it has not been made into for PBS yet!What I like about this series is that it doesn't try to be anything it is not; that in itself makes it charming, and if you want to read a simple, feel good, clean series, then this is it.

112872,A Light in the Window,Athornton,487,2,5,"November 27, 2010","Another charming read. It was good to reconnect with the characters in this quaint town. It's a good holiday read because it is not overwhelming, sad or depressing. I would love to visit a town like this if it in fact exists, with knowing each and every person's history, supporting each other and the town parties and festivities that everyone has to play a role in. I like how the characters' stories continue to wind together and new relations are discovered plus the inclusion of one of two outsiders to keep the story going. I was also happier reading this story since it focused on only a few of the characters and did not have as much character introductions, as the first book did. Made it much easier to follow the book. I am looking forward to reading more in the storyline and to continue to see the evolving characters!",5,N/A
112872,A Light in the Window,Jennifer,"1,060",64,4,"September 19, 2019","I just loved this so much and I’ve laughed over and over again. What a wonderful town and I love all the people who live here. Jan Karon is a wonderful writer full of surprises. If you want something good then this series is for you. It’s light, fun and full of laughs. This was a library loan and all opinions are my own.

112872,A Light in the Window,Marilyn,308,6,4,"April 11, 2007","John McDonough is Father Tim. He has narrated all of the Mitford series books and is a treasure. As many know, quite often the scenes center on his fictional church or the choir. A veteran of the Glimmerglass Opera Company, he sings the hymns himself which is an extra treat for listeners. When one voice actor has read all of the titles in a series, that performer has created a strong connection to listeners. Thus, just as listening to another story of Mitford is enhanced by its familiarity so hearing John McDonough's narration stirs feelings of comfort and recognition. McDonough describes his first reading of a book as being ' like the first listening of a piece of music.' 'You have to be completely free,' he said. . 'As you read and think about the piece, you hear voices, and it starts to take on life.' How fortunate for all of us! In this, the second installment of the popular series, Father Tim has just returned from a vacation - his first in over a dozen years. While he enjoyed the respite he is a bit anxious to come home and see his neighbor, Cynthia Coppersmith, a woman with whom he thought he had an understanding. He's perplexed by what he perceives as her coolness and a bit agitated when a widow in his congregation sets her sights on him. The church has undertaken the building of a care center and an unexpected visitor arrives, evidently for an extended stay. Life goes on in Mitford as listeners renew acquaintances with some of the townspeople and once again are charmed by the fictional community.",4,N/A
112872,A Light in the Window,Tracy,341,12,2,"May 16, 2009","What I learned from this book: It's me, not you. I am the one who is impatient. I am the one who is unable to find any sort of humor in innocent misunderstandings or mistaken identities. (This also explains why I'm not a fan of French farce.) I have proven to myself this year that I am indeed capable of enjoying stories that don't involve other-worldly creatures or kick-butt crime-solving or alternate realities (those would be the Maisie Dobbs books and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society), but I find myself unable to commit to you, dear Mitfordians.Again, please forgive me. It is definitely me, not you. There are thousands, probably millions, of readers who will love you and treasure you for all that you are. Because you are a decent, hard-working and pleasant story. But you don't need me and my unreasonable expectations of action and directness and adventure.Can we still be friends?",4,1 comment
