6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Alexandra,54,12,5,"May 13, 2011","I bought ""A Praying Life"" over a year ago. . . I respect the author and after the recommendations from a good friend and my pastor, I knew it was a ""must read."" But. . . I picked it up, put it down. . . picked it up, put it down. . . I even bought it for my mother-in-law, and still hadn't read it.Now, over a year later, I finally read it. (The first book to be read on my birthday kindle!) And. . . wow. . . just what I needed at this point in my life. Unpretentious, Gospel-focused, practical. . . I have been encouraged and inspired to pray, not guilted to pray.I've felt the need to be on my knees more lately. It seems as each year passes, I feel the need is greater. My children are getting older. I know how praying made a difference in the moment-by-moment of motherhood when they were younger, but now I feel a greater need to parent-through-prayer.While this isn't the best summary of the book, I want to encourage other Believers to get the book and. . . in the right time, read it. Let the Lord use it as a tool in your life to redirect you to Himself. ",40,4
6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Nathan Moore,203,38,3,"February 8, 2012","I'm somewhat ambivalent about this book. Partly because many raving reviews led to high expectations on my part and partly because this is an odd book. The phrase that kept coming to my mind while I read it was ""A Praying Memoir"" for that's what it felt like. Though perhaps more often than necessary, Miller gave dozens of personal stories that gave the book a helpful, earthy feel. I appreciate the author's grittiness and willingness to take all the frustrations of a praying life seriously. The book was a strange mixture of really helpful thoughts followed by too many antidotes and personal details. I can however, see how this would appeal to some readers.Using the Lord's prayer in the Garden as the primary model, Miller's treatment of Biblical teaching on prayer was very sparse and thus widely assumed. This is not to say that he did not have some helpful observations, just that this work lacked a Biblical treatment of prayer. His focus was much more on how to fit that practically into life. It should also be noted that there are several places where it is evident that Miller has been influenced by the Mystics. His mystic streaks detract some from the value of this work.The most helpful parts of the book to me included his thoughts on what it means to become like a child in prayer, praying 'in God's story,' and his prayer card system.While reading ""A Praying Life,"" I simultaneously read C.S. Lewis' ""Letters to Malcolm: Chiefly on Prayer"" Though I wasn't expecting many similarities, these books couldn't be more different. Lewis' thoughts were, as one might expect, much more philosophical as Lewis tried to grapple with the many extravagant promises regarding prayer in the Scriptures. Lewis seemed unable to come away with many conclusions. This reminded me that the current corpus of literature has a massive gap regarding the subject of prayer. This makes me judge Miller's effort more positively because prayer is quite mysterious. There is something good to be said for Miller's admirable attempts to, in spite of many unresolved mysteries, provide us a gritty memoir of how to pray. Notwithstanding this commendable effort, may I suggest that the reception of this book suggests that the church needs to do a whole lot more thinking (& writing) on the subject of prayer?If you are looking for a deeply intimate, highly practical treatment of how to incorporate prayer into your life, this may be helpful to you.",12,N/A
6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Susy C. *MotherLambReads*,357,41,5,"August 1, 2020","""Without the Good Shepherd, we are alone in a meaningless story. Weariness and fear leave us feeling overwhelmed, unable to move. Cynicism leaves us doubting, unable to dream. The combination shuts down our hearts, and we just show up for life, going through the motions.”....“Prayer is asking God to incarnate, to get dirty in your life. Yes, the eternal God scrubs floors. For sure we know he washes feet. So take Jesus at his word. Ask him. Tell him what you want. Get dirty. Write out your prayer requests; don't mindlessly drift through life on the American narcotic of busyness. If you try to seize the day, the day will eventually break you. Seize the corner of his garment and don't let go until he blesses you. He will reshape the day.”....“We don't know how bad we are until we try to be good. Nothing exposes our selfishness and spiritual pwerlessness like prayer.”And so many other good quotes. I actually need to buy this book since I was lent a copy. I could have marked the whole thing. It was an authentic, humble, refreshing look at prayer and prayer life. Practical ways to improve and start doing better. Humble stories of the author's own life that led him to write this. I was constantly reminded that through prayer is how we see God's constant weaving of our lives. His constant direction.",8,N/A
6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Jamie Lapeyrolerie ,518,120,5,"February 4, 2015","Without a doubt, I know the incredible and amazing power of prayer. I’ve witnessed it and have felt it, yet it’s still something I can always/need to deepen in my life. Anyone else out there like that? Well, recently my best friend got this for me and there were so many excellent pieces of wisdom, I had to share this one with y’all!“Christians aren’t superior, but our Savior is. He makes the difference. He is alive and well in His church.”Full of wisdom and examples from his own life, Miller isn’t afraid to share his heart, his and his family’s story, his mistakes and life lessons. As the book describes, this book is very much down-to-earth and revealed some helpful points and encouragement.“Oddly enough, many people struggle to learn how to pray because they are focusing on praying, not on God.”The book was also encouraging because I don’t have the perfect prayers and that’s okay with Jesus.“God also cheers when we come to Him with our wobbling, unsteady prayers. Jesus does not say, “Come to me, all you who have learned how to concentrate in prayer, whose mind no longer wander, and I will you rest.” No, Jesus opens his arms to his needy children.”“So instead of being paralyzed by who you are, begin with who you are. That’s how the gospel works. God begins with you. It’s a little scary because you are so messed up.”There were some convicting statements too. Sometimes you need a nudge and gentle reminder to get things back in focus right? Like this gem:If you are not praying, then you are quietly confident that time, money, and talent are all you need in life. You’ll always be a little too tired, a little too busy. But if, like Jesus, you realize you can’t do life on your own, then no matter how busy, no matter how tired you are, you’ll find time to pray.Time in prayer makes you even more dependent on God because you don’t have as much time to get things done. Every minute spent in prayer is one less minute where you can be doing something “productive.”If we think we can do life on our own, we will not take prayer seriously.I could fill this post with plenty of more quotes, but I’ll just say this book was an excellent resource and I know I’ll be coming back to it in the coming years. This book also shared excellent reminders about God’s timeline and how His answers are sometimes vastly different than ours, but far more than we could have imagined. One example Miller used was a prayer him and his wife prayed for 5 years. After those 5 years, it was incredible to see the why, the how and the goodness of the Lord.Promise this is the last quote because it was something that had me thinking about for awhile: “Sometimes when we say “God is silent,” what’s really going on is that He hasn’t told the story the way we wanted it told. He will be silent when we want Him to fill in the blanks of the story we are creating. But with His own stories, the ones we live in, He is seldom silent.” Good stuff!What have been some encouraging things about prayer you’ve recently learned?Originally posted at http://booksandbeverages.org/2015/02/...",8,N/A
6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Bob Hayton,246,31,5,"February 19, 2017","As a lifelong Christian, I've heard a great deal of teaching about prayer and read a good many books on the topic. I've been taught to model my prayers on The Lord's Prayer. I've learned the ACTS method (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication). I've been encouraged to trust God for impossible answers, and above all, I've been made very aware of my spiritual shortcomings with regard to the discipline of regular, personal prayer.Like many, I have tended to view prayer as a spiritual discipline I need to accomplish. So I try harder to do this prayer thing -- this spiritual event accompanied by certain kinds of emotions and feelings. When I fail, I am overcome with guilt. When I don't pray, I find it hard to start praying again. It seems I just never measure up to my perfect ideal of what my personal praying should be. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed wonderful seasons of prayer. I've had many spiritually high moments in prayer. I've seen God work through my prayers. But I don't have the level of spiritual stamina at praying that I would like.Given this context, I jumped at the chance to receive Paul Miller's A Praying Life: Connecting with God in a Distracting World, by NavPress, for free. The specific challenge was to read the book, and post about the results of a personal 30 days of real prayer, implementing the principles from the book in my own prayer life. Thanks again, Michelle Bennett for that challenge. I'm so glad I read this book.A Praying Life is easily the best book I've read in the past several years. Miller speaks with an uncommon grace, and his book plants the spiritual discipline of prayer squarely upon the truths of the Gospel. A praying life is the goal, not regular disciplined moments of spiritual ecstasy. Miller's book is distinguished from others I've read in that it stresses prayer's connection with the gospel, it explains how a lack of prayer betrays a lack of dependence on God, and it illustrates through Paul Miller's own personal family stories, how prayer connects with all of life. In short, the book makes a praying life seem real, and possible.I wish I could say after these 30 days, that my prayer life has been completely revolutionized. But after reading the book, I can definitely say my thinking about prayer has. I want to share a few of the principles that came home powerfully to me as I read this book.First, I was reminded that Jesus invites us to pray. And our prayer is part of a life lived in confidence in the Gospel.Jesus does not say, “Come to me, all you who have learned how to concentrate in prayer, whose minds no longer wander, and I will give you rest.” No, Jesus opens his arms to his needy children and says, “Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28, NASB). The criteria for coming to Jesus is weariness. Come overwhelmed with life. Come with your wandering mind. Come messy....We know that to become a Christian we shouldn’t try to fix ourselves up, but when it comes to praying we completely forget that. We’ll sing the old gospel hymn, “Just as I Am,” but when it comes to praying, we don’t come just as we are. We try, like adults, to fix ourselves up. Private, personal prayer is one of the last great bastions of legalism. In order to pray like a child, you might need to unlearn the nonpersonal, nonreal praying that you’ve been taught. (pg. 29-30)Prayer mirrors the gospel. In the gospel, the Father takes us as we are because of Jesus and gives us his gift of salvation. In prayer, the Father receives us as we are because of Jesus and gives us his gift of help. We look at the inadequacy of our praying and give up, thinking something is wrong with us. God looks at the adequacy of his Son and delights in our sloppy, meandering prayers. (pg. 53-54)Second, I was challenged to see that when I don't pray, I am basically telling God I'm good enough that I don't really need him. Ouch! This point has really revolutionized how I think about prayer. I have more of a desire to pray, even though I'm still not ""good enough"" at it. Although I'll never really be good enough, still I want to show my dependence on God in praying constantly for specific help.If you are not praying, then you are quietly confident that time, money, and talent are all you need in life. You’ll always be a little too tired, a little too busy. But if, like Jesus, you realize you can’t do life on your own, then no matter how busy, no matter how tired you are, you will find the time to pray. Time in prayer makes you even more dependent on God because you don’t have as much time to get things done. Every minute spent in prayer is one less minute where you can be doing something “productive.” So the act of praying means that you have to rely more on God. (pg. 47)Third, prayer really is about being helpless. We come to Christ in the gospel as a helpless sinner. We are to have faith like a helpless child. We should pray as helpless Christians. We really do need our Savior's continual help! This last line should get the ""duh!"" award. But so often we live like we really don't. The more mature we become as Christians, the more aware of our sinfulness and helplessness we should be. And thus we should pray more.Fourth, I learned that ""we don't need self-discipline to pray continuously"". Instead ""we just need to be poor in spirit"". Poverty of spirit makes room for his Spirit. It creates a God-shaped hole in our hearts and offers us a new way to relate to others. (pg. 64)If we think we can do life on our own, we will not take prayer seriously. Our failure to pray will always feel like something else — a lack of discipline or too many obligations. But when something is important to us, we make room for it. Prayer is simply not important to many Christians because Jesus is already an add-on. (pg. 57)A big theme of the book is how suffering is often the context where we learn to pray. It grows us and shows us our true need. It helps make prayer important.Fifth, prayer is not about some special feeling or perfect spiritual experience.Instead of hunting for the perfect spiritual state to lift you above the chaos, pray in the chaos. As your heart or your circumstances generate problems, keep generating prayer. You will find that the chaos lessens. (pg. 72)Too often we seek the perfect spiritual state, when we really should just pray to God out of a heart full of need.Sixth, I learned that prayer changes things. As we pray we should look for ways our prayers are having an effect. We should seek to use prayer to change the hearts of those we love. Our problems and all of life's difficulties can be shaped and met with prayer.When you stop trying to control your life and instead allow your anxieties and problems to bring you to God in prayer, you shift from worry to watching. You watch God weave his patterns in the story of your life. Instead of trying to be out front, designing your life, you realize you are inside God’s drama. (pg. 72)That's the secret of the praying life. It's not your own story, it's God. He becomes the One in control. By prayer we see Him working. By prayer we let Him into our lives.Seventh, I was given a practical method of prayer which I've begun to adopt. He explains how to have a prayer card -- a 3.5"" notecard -- for each major area in life that you pray about. Have one for each of the members of your family and pray a specific verse for them. Add individual requests to the card over time. Keep track of answers to prayer. I've slowly begun to create cards and I find them easier to use than a prayer list. It's more personal and focused on the subject or person at hand.I've only scratched the surface of what is contained in the book. It is very readable, because Paul Miller interweaves personal stories of his children and life together with various prayers he has. He shows how prayer helped him deal with situations and persons. How prayer was answered slowly over time in the lives of his children. How prayer allowed him to parent well, and love others rather than react negatively.I'm confident that if you pick up A Praying Life, your prayer life will improve as well. May God challenge us all to have praying lives.",7,2

6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Bambi Moore,230,26,4,"April 6, 2019",This book had some 3 star moments as well as a few 5.

6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Justin,25,2,4,"January 22, 2023","Lately, God’s been pushing me to (re)discover the power of prayer. I’ve been finding myself subconsciously believing in prayer less and consequently, denying His means of grace in my life. As I reflected on this dry season, I decided to pick up this book before diving deep into ministry again. This book was recommended by a few of my close friends and I must say, it is very accurate in assessing my heart and powerful in convicting me to pursue the heart of the Father in prayer.This book is filled with personal anecdotes from Paul Miller and very practical advice in how to conduct a prayerful life. Looking at his experiences, the childlike heart he preaches about in Part 1 is evident in his own life and deeply encouraging for me. Many may consider someone like him to be passive and naïve. But like he said, utter dependence in the LORD is critical to the walk of a christian.Along with his experiences, he shares his own analyses of a modern-day christian’s experience with prayer. I particularly liked his chapters on cynicism and on the nuances of living in the Word and by the Spirit. I find much of what he writes to be very relatable and precise, like a good doctor’s diagnosis. He also gives practical tips and methods to apply what he teaches to our daily lives.Overall, the book is very easy to read and deeply convicting. I knocked off one point because I found his sections on unanswered prayers to be a bit lacking. Other than that, I highly recommend all to read this and apply his teachings to their daily prayer lives. Thank you LORD for speaking to me through this book!",5,N/A
6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Bill Stutzman,95,4,4,"January 15, 2013","After hearing this book referenced in sermons from a few different pastors and friends, I added it to my reading list with modest hopes but not high expectations. I have long desired to grow in my prayer disciplines, but I am also wary of books I perceive to be ""self-help"" or systematic regarding such disciplines. There is no doubt that pitfalls abound in the genre, but Miller navigates the subject with wisdom and humility. As for me, I found my skepticism conquered by Miller's sound, sincere, and practical treatment of prayer. Best of all, I found myself refreshed and spurred on to love and good deeds through prayer in ways that I had hoped but never anticipated. This book persuaded me to change several habits in my life while avoiding guilt-tactics or programs bound to fail. I soon found myself joining the chorus of voices recommending this book for its challenging call to recapture one of Christendom's central spiritual disciplines in our own time.Miller's approach depends on a blend of scriptural examples and personal anecdotes as he helps the reader see his own relation to God in a new light. He powerfully blends truths from the word with his own successes and failures in the practice of prayer, drawing upon years of trial and triumph in his own family. Through his vulnerability he challenges readers to give credit and glory to God for answering the smallest of prayers up to the grandest, both in a moment and over years and years of faithful pleading. Miller invites the reader to consider the way God uses prayer for others to shape and prune us at the same time. He begins with qualifications for approaching God: childlike faith and genuine need. Avoiding overly prescriptive advice, he presents the principles of prayer through reorienting the reader to the nature of God's character, the purpose of prayer, and our own dependency upon Jesus. His own stories of God's powerful work in his family (and especially the way prayer influenced his roles as husband and father) provide powerful testimony to the wisdom and grace of God, much of which takes a long view to see. Through these examples we are invited to look back on the narratives of our own lives for what God has done, and we are given a reason to hope and expect even mightier things in the narrative to come. Miller shows us how prayer opens our eyes to that narrative and magnifies God before our eyes and those of others. Perhaps most importantly, he reminds the reader of the power of using God's own word in prayer, offering back to Him scripture as applied to our own lives and for those for whom we are praying. I have been amazed at the power of this simple suggestion and practice as captured from the spirit of the psalms and other scriptures.Miller's book resonated with me on a number of levels, dealing with the specific discipline of prayer and seeing our lives in the context of God's narrative for us (and all the world) particularly. I approached this book looking for a way to refresh my ideas of prayer and see if I could latch onto something that would jog me out of my rut. While most of what Miller offers through the book works to get the reader reawakened to the power of God through specific prayer (thus accomplishing the reorientation of the heart), he also provided helpful suggestions for making changes, both practical and attainable. While never presented in the form of legalistic rules, these suggestions nonetheless gave traction around his guiding principles. Since reading this book and following just a few of his suggestions as adapted to my own context, I have been amazed at how God has opened new vistas in this area of my life.Like many life-changing books, this one may have to come across your desk at just the right moment in order to grip you. Perhaps you are already well-established in prayer. In that case this book may reinforce what you already know (as it often did for me as well). God had been preparing my heart and desires for some time in this topic through my own need and the recommendation of others, and I am grateful for how He used Miller's book. I was ready for help but wary of taking poor advice, trying and failing, or setting up a new legalism. Miller's A Praying Life answered each of those concerns directly (and more) and, through the work of the Holy Spirit, encouraged me with a renewed attitude toward God, His word, and my neighbors in prayer. If you are interested in principles of corporate prayer, you will find this book addresses more the private disciplines, though similar principles may be extended. With a multitude of books to choose from and only so much time to spend, no one wants to read a bad book. For the 21st century Christian in need of a return to the priceless heritage of personal prayer, I couldn't recommend a book more worth your time.",5,N/A

6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Caroline Mann,166,7,4,"September 7, 2020","When one of my best and most treasured friends, Annie, gave me this book as a gift, I felt conflicted. I felt grateful because I know Annie doesn’t recommend books lightly. She has both excellent taste and a close attention for the preferences of friends. I felt disheartened because of the title - A Praying Life. I have a hard enough time with a few minutes of prayer. A praying life? .....okay.... The thing is, I grew up in a Christian home and in a Christian community and prayer has almost always felt like something nice but not necessary. Extra salt on a meal or an umbrella when there’s a slight chance of rain. Combine this disaffection with my ADHD diagnosis and it’s no mystery why I’ve spent little time working on my prayer life.But Annie gave it to me, so I read it. (And, side note, I love looking back and seeing God work through my friends). This book is specific, clear, and well organized. It is inescapably relatable and uncomfortably convicting (uncomfortable if you, like me, are more practiced at realizing flaws in others rather than yourself). This book is a reassurance, but it does not condescend. It is a guide, but it is not legalistic. Most importantly, Miller’s writing demystifies prayer from what can often seem like a vague and/or trite and/or worthless act into the necessary, life-giving, redemptive-centered practice that it is. At the core of prayer, he reveals, is Jesus. The very God who can feel so distant and confusing - he waits for us to come to him in prayer.I’m not explaining this as well as Miller does.

Miller’s explanation of what it means to approach the Lord with true childlike faith has really relieved so many of the obstacles I faced in my prayer life.If we are to approach our Father as a child, we ought to come messy, selfish, unorganized, and needy. Only when we have this level of transparency with the Lord are we then able to build a more fruitful relationship with Him. Great book.",4,1 comment
6426403,A Praying Life Connecting with God in a Distracting World,Tori Samar,523,69,5,"May 21, 2020","One phrase comes to mind whenever I think of A Praying Life: paradigm shift. I've read plenty of books that challenged, educated, stretched, encouraged, fascinated, or even annoyed me. But for all that reading, I have encountered very few books whose ideas were powerful enough to completely shift my perspective from one place to another. While I've had many books expand or tweak my thinking on an issue, I've had relatively few revolutionize it. This book has the honor of being part of that small list. So let me explain just a few of the ideas that grabbed hold of me most:1. When I first read this book, I wanted ideas on how to have a better, more consistent prayer time. Instead, I got invigorated to have a better praying life. Paul Miller is all for having a consistent, daily time of prayer (preferably first thing in the morning). But what he really wants is for us to see how prayer weaves into every nook and cranny of our lives. Once we grasp prayer as our communication line with our Father, and once we grasp our complete dependency on Him to make a difference in our lives (both inner and outer!), we won't be able to help but keep that communication line open 24/7. 2. I want to be the kind of person who prays for a parking spot. Say what? At the beginning of Chapter 14, Miller mentions reading a book in which the author said not to pray for trivial things like parking spaces because such requests are just selfish. When Miller shares this remark with his mother, her response goes like this: ""She looked a little incredulous, cocked her head, started laughing, and said, 'How else would you find a parking place?'"" The simplicity of his mother's reaction astounded and humbled me when I read it, and it still does today. She is 100% right. How else would you find one? Somewhere along the way, I (and many other Christians) bought into the lie that God doesn't care about or have anything to do with the mundane details of life. We get to (or have to) be in control of those things; we are not dependent on Him in those areas. Not so, says Miller:""The little child that Jesus urged us to become is completely dependent on his parents for everything."" Closely tied to this lie is the lie that God wants our submission to His will to be so deep that we never actually tell Him what we want. We ask for things, almost guiltily, but then ""submit so quickly that [we] disappear."" Miller calls this ""overspiritualizing"" prayer. Guilty. Guilty on all counts. God, give me a heart to include You in every aspect of my life and to be honest with You!3. Ask God for change. Don't be a cynic. Don't be afraid that He'll actually do it. Ask God to change you, your loved ones, and your world. Miller exposed my cynicism in not praying well for others who struggle with besetting sins. I don't pray for them as I ought because I don't actually think they can ever change. The same principle applies to praying for the sin-beset world and culture in which we live. Miller also exposed my hesitancy to pray honestly for God to change me because I'm afraid (and also a massive control-freak): ""Almost every Christian is confident God will answer a prayer for change in us, and it scares us to death. For example, what happens if you pray for patience? God permits suffering in your life. What happens if you pray for humility? God humbles you. We're scared of such prayers because we want to remain in control of our lives. We don't trust God."" Yes, indeed, it is a terrifying thing to ask the Potter to change me. I know He's not just going to snap His fingers and fix my flaws. He's going to poke and push and prod and leave me in the fire until I'm in the shape of His Son. 4. I need to watch for the story God is weaving in my life and others' lives. I need to be willing to stay in the desert. Miller encourages us to see unanswered prayers as evidence that God is still telling the story He wants to tell. Don't grow impatient with Him and take matters into your own hands, fighting to close the gap between your present reality and your hope for the future. And don't give up. Keep praying. Watch to see how the story goes as you pray and take action when it's time (because what Miller has learned is that as he prays and watches, God expects him to get involved in his own prayers). This is a major area of my life in which God continues to work on me. Waiting is such a struggle for me. Being patient in the story is hard. So God, please give me a heart that is willing to wait. Give me the faith to stay in the desert as long as you ask me to. Give me a heart that delights to see how you want to tell my story.Honestly, this review only grazes the surface of good things in this book. So please, just read it. Read it and be changed.",4,1 comment

If I could only recommend 1 book about Christianity outside of the Bible it would be this one (or Gentle & Lowly). Prayer is laid out so simply and stunningly that it’s mind blowing. It doesn’t over complicate or over explain or go legalistic. It has helped me to finally feel freedom and confidence and consistency in my prayer life which is exactly how the Lord always intended it be. Full of scripture, none of it is opinion and also full of humility in how Miller lives out prayer for himself and his family. I just loved it!!! Go read it right now!!!! Im gonna read this one again!! ",4,N/A
