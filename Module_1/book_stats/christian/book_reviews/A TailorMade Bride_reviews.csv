6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Lindsey (Books for Christian Girls),"1,514",3354,4,"March 14, 2022","4 stars at the first read, 3.5 stars at the second.About this book: “When a dressmaker who values beauty tangles with a liveryman who condemns vanity, the sparks begin to fly! Jericho ""J.T."" Tucker wants nothing to do with the new dressmake in Coventry, Texas. He's all too familiar with her kind—shallow women more devoted to fashion than true beauty. Yet, except for her well-tailored clothing, this seamstress is not at all what he expected.  Hannah Richards is confounded by the man who runs the livery. The unsmiling fellow riles her with his arrogant assumptions and gruff manner while at the same time stirring her heart with unexpected acts of kindness. Which side of Jericho Tucker reflects the real man?  When Hannah decides to help Jericho's sister catch a beau—leading to consequences neither could have foreseen—will Jericho and Hannah find a way to bridge the gap between them?”Series: No, a stand-alone.

Particularly in the first half because he was a twerp to Hannah, and while less overall in the second half, I still would’ve been fine with whacking him with a shoe a few times then as well. There were more than a few parts of him noticing her curves or her noticing his muscles that made their romance be based much more on the physical attraction side, which albeit is common for the enemies-to-lovers trope, is not my favorite to read about. They had a lot of cute moments that made me smile, and I really enjoyed all the faith content in this novel, but I do hesitate to recommend this book to anyone under 16 because of all the kisses and noticing.

6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Jae Roth,133,3,1,"June 28, 2011","First of all, this is a Christian Romance. I'm annoyed at the people who left one star reviews because of that. Do your homework people! You wouldn't walk into a dress store and pull out something cause you liked the color. You'd check to see if it fit you. The story is published by Bethany House. Bethany House is an inspirational/Christian publisher.That aside, the story itself does leave room for criticism. Pacing is painfully slow and there is very little happening in the story. Even the moments meant to inspire tension are sadly lacking. Look, we know the heroine isn't going to die two thirds of the way through the book. And the ""bad guy"", well, the author goes out of her way to make excuses for him and to try to paint him as young, misunderstood and confused. She even makes a silly attempt to redeem him at the end which doesn't work.The characters are fairly uninspiring on the whole. The hero is a sanctimonious twit most of the book worried that a few bits of lace will make women go mad with temptation cause his mother ran out on his pa for a rich man who could buy her more things. Really? Dude needs to see his prairie shrink to get over his momma issues.There is a message in this book that shouldn't be in a book period, but definitely not in a romance novel. The story carries a message that a woman needs to pretty herself up and loose those nagging 10 lbs. for a man to like her, or she'll end up with the sociopath down the street cause he's the only one who could like her. I get the heroine is fitness obsessed, and yes we are talking about a historical novel here. She spends half the book exercising. But to have her take the hero's sister who is described as a bit plump and make her do these exercises and starve herself to lose weight so the guy she likes will like her back is ridiculous and a bad message. Of course there is a lot of lip service to the ""oh, he like her just as she was,"" nonsense, but the kicker here is the hero's sister doesn't get the guy until the heroine puts her through prairie boot-camp.

6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Beth,775,314,4,"December 25, 2011","What a fun, sweet read! I needed just such a book at the time that I read this one. The characters are endearing, and the romance is sweet.The main character, Hannah, is opening a dress shop in Texas, and I really liked her determination to succeed in that business. Despite his misgivings of dresses and fancy attire, J.T. finds himself falling for her and their mishaps and bungling of situations were charming. I do feel that they fell in love a bit quickly. Although the progression of their relationship was a bit rushed, it was still heartfelt without being too cheesy or overdone.J.T. came across as painfully stubborn, but that made it so much better when he finally does come around. I enjoyed the relationship between Hannah and J.T's sister immensely, it was very well done.Although some aspects of Witemeyer's ideas were a bit on the nose, I love how ultimately the characters depict how important the line between vanity and appreciating beauty/feeling beautiful really is.I so looked forward to reading this novel and am so glad I read it when I did. I look forward to Witemeyer's other novels as well and recommend this one for someone interested in sweet, light romances with a historical setting.",9,N/A
6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Sarita,"1,038",624,4,"January 25, 2018","What an enjoyable read. This book was light and fun with some well deserved giggles, but also included depth and some very on-my-seat action parts.They way Hannah and Jericho turned to the Lord when they were faced with some hard truths, is a great example I wish to be able to also do when I'm facing situations I don't like. Even when Jericho fought against seeking the truth because he was afraid of the result, he at the end submitted to God.The romance was sweet between the characters and I found myself with a big grin most of the time.This is the second book I have read by Karen Witemeyer and hopefully not the last.Definitely recommended.",9,1 comment

6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Casey,416,105,5,"September 17, 2010","With a prose that stands up and grabs the reader’s attention, this debut novel did not disappoint this reader!I found great delight within the pages of TAILOR MADE BRIDE. Jericho, Hannah and Cordelia, even the villains and secondary characters were brought to life. I loved the word usage, the character portrayal, their interactions, it all shouted to me that this book is one to be remembered.Jericho and Hannah’s relations are funny and romantic. What a hero! And what a romantic chemistry, it made me sigh and my heart give little jumps.The struggles and faith of the characters are well portrayed without feeling stilted or overdone. Each one had growth and changes and through some had it to grow more than others, it was done in a well written manner. My favorite scene was one of the first in the book when Hannah falls through the floorboard and into Jericho’s arms. What a visual image! And this whole book was like reading in a dream. I was there. No doubt about it, this novel is extremely well written.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute in this book and almost wished it to go on and on. A great read, don’t miss it!",6,15

6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Margaret Metz,415,9,5,"May 18, 2010","This is one of those books I looked forward to ever since I saw the cover art last year. The more I read about it, the more I wanted to read it. It didn't disappoint.I know you shouldn't judge a book by a cover ~ but how many of us do just that? We either are drawn to the gorgeous dress (like on this one) or repelled by what we don't like on another. It's like that in life too. Jericho Tucker has done just that in this book. He takes one look at Hannah Richards and sees all the things he hates and fears. He certainly doesn't want to get to get entangled with the seamstress himself - no matter how nice she seems.The two of them are like watching an old fashioned bumper cars at night. They slam into each other and seem to be causing quite a fuss ~ but beneath all the noise and clamor you see the sparks flying.Jericho is a wonderful hero. He is two parts stubborn and three parts generous. Add in a little bit wounded, handy with his tools, protective, and thoughtful. He looks out for his sister, the widow that works next door to Hannah, his assistant, Tom, and even Hannah. He may not want to get involved with her, but he doesn't want her to get hurt or not have what she needs.Hannah can't understand why the livery owner is so grouchy and mad at her - and yet helps her so often. Even worse, she finds she likes him far more than she'd like to admit. When she finds out he objects to her job and thinks she is trying to lead women astray by appealing to their vanity, she knows there is no hope he'll ever like her.Hannah is great. She's determined, independent, kind and trusting. She is a little insecure and fearful, but she is willing to work hard to overcome any difficulties that come her way. She was a really like-able person. I found myself wanting to have her for a friend. Maybe we could meet for hot cocoa in the morning after she went for her ""constitutional."" :o)When you want to sit down with the characters in the book then you know the author has done an excellent job. This was one of my favorite books so far. I have to thank the author and the publisher for providing my copy of the book. I am very thankful, but it in no way influenced my review. ",5,13
6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Margaret Chind,"3,109",210,5,"February 19, 2020",First time novel for Karen Witemeyer has earned a permanent space on my keeper shelf and a guaranteed to-buy list selection for future titles such as Head in the Clouds. The Bethany House cover artists out did themselves on these covers and the story within in skilled to match right on par. I was pleased and tickled to giggles by the humor and personality within the characters in the pages of A Tailor-Made Bride. I am so glad to have discovered Karen's writing and cannot wait patiently enough for more books to come. In all of the books that I read I have a little less than a handful of favorite authors and Karen has just added herself to that list. With a similar whit and seriousness of issues and drama as Mary Connealy and Vickie McDonough I cannot elaborate enough how much I enjoyed the page by page turn of events in the lives of the people within these pages. *Thanks to Karen Witemeyer and Bethany House Publishers for providing a copy for review.*,5,4
6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Ririn Aziz,707,91,3,"August 6, 2014","All that I think about when i finished reading this book, that this is a calm read. If you need something to escape the turbulence of most romance novel, then you should read this one.A sweet story about a dressmaker and a liveryman. Hannah Richards got a chance to realiaze her dream of opening her own shop when a patron of hers deeded the shop to her. So she arrived in Coventry, Texas with the hope to be a successful dressmaker. Jericho ""J.T."" Tucker tried to resist his growing attraction for the beautiful dressmaker. But, since his mother left her husband and two small children to be a rich old man mistress just so she could satisfy her needs for pretty things, he resented women who he thought would be the same as his own mother especially the beautiful woman who make the pretty and elegant dress just like what her mother would like. But then, the more he knew Hannah, the more he realized that not all women were like his mother. Setting in 1880's Texas, the story was full of good people (reminded me of The House on the Prairie tv series back when I was small. Still haven't read the book series yet) . Even the one who supposed to be ""the villain"" was not a bad man.PS - Actually, I was attracted by the cover. Gorgeous dress!",5,N/A

6973772,A TailorMade Bride,Emily Tuckett,17,5,4,"June 28, 2012","The world needs more realistic happily ever afters. So if you are looking for that perfect feel-good, chick-flick-ish novel then A Tailor-Made Bride by Karen Witemeyer will satisfy better than a cupcake scented bubble bath. This Historical-Fiction romance is clean and delightful. The main characters are very religious, so don’t be surprised by respectful references to God. The banter is witty and the characters rich in integrity.Witemeyer’s writing was above average, but it was the plot that continually surprised me. Events I predicted did happen, but the story was ripe with delightful twists and character development. Hannah was a character I loved immediately. The romance was semi-predictable but absolutely satisfying. Witemeyer was able to create an exciting chemistry and deep feelings etween the characters (and between the reader) without resorting to heaving bosoms or crude innuendos. More experienced authors have failed where A Tailor-Made Bride succeeded. I was surprised to discover that this was Witemeyer’s first novel. Her skill in writing is that of a long-time author. I loved A Tailor-Made Bride, and I look forward toward Witemeyer’s next novel!Content Ratings (Highlight to view)Foul Language: NoneSexual Content: None (Chaste kissing and some PG chemistry)Content: Normal (One character does get held at knife point, and one act of vandalism occurs.)Originally Posted at http://mynoveladdiction.blog.com/2012... by Emily Tuckett",4,N/A
