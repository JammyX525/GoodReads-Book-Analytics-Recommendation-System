But joy costs pain.""""fear isn’t only a guide to keep us safe; it’s also a manipulative emotion that can trick us into living a boring life.""""It made me wonder if the reasons our lives seem so muddled is because we keep walking into scenes in which we, along with the people around us, have no clear idea what we want.""""God wants us to create beautiful stories, and whatever it is that isn’t God wants us to create meaningless stories, teaching the people around us that life just isn’t worth living.""""Most Americans aren’t living very good stories. It’s not our fault, I don’t think. We are suckered into it. We are brainwashed, I think.""""Advertising does exactly this. We watch a commercial advertising a new Volvo, and suddenly we feel our life isn’t as content as it once was. Our life doesn’t have the new Volvo in it. And the commercial convinces us we will only be content if we have a car with forty-seven airbags. And so we begin our story of buying a Volvo, only to repeat the story with a new weed eater and then a new home stereo. And this can go on for a lifetime. When the credits roll, we wonder what we did with our lives, and what was the meaning.""""The ambitions we have will become the stories we live. If you want to know what a person’s story is about, just ask them what they want. If we don’t want anything, we are living boring stories, and if we want a Roomba vaccum cleaner, we are living stupid stories. If it won’t work in a story, it won’t work in life.""""when something hard happens to you, you have two choices in how to deal with it. You can either get bitter, or better. I chose to get better. It’s made all the difference.""""I realized how much of our lives are spent trying to avoid conflict. Half the commercials on television are selling us something that will make life easier. Part of me wonders if our stories aren’t being stolen by the easy life.""""every conflict, no matter how hard, comes back to bless the protagonist if he will face his fate with courage. There is no conflict man can endure that will not produce a blessing.""""When you stop expecting people to be perfect, you can like them for who they are. And when you stop expecting material possessions to complete you, you’d be surprised at how much pleasure you get in material possessions.

He has a wonderful conversational style of writing. I liked his honesty. He shares stories from his life freely, sharing both his good and bad choices through both humorous as well as serious stories. Some of the stories caused me to belly laugh and others, like the death of his friend's wife made me sob. He shares about his father leaving when he was a child and about his finding his father later as an adult. He writes about how our lives are stories and that we need to think of them this way so that we make our lives truly good stories. He has definately inspired me to make sure that my life is a ""good story."" I feel more ready to go out and try something crazy now...well maybe not too crazy?",11,3

While reading the Blog of Impossible Things, I came across this book. With the magic of e-books, I had the book in my hands and read by the end of the evening. I laughed out loud at the first page and cried at the last. What an unique approach to living a meaningful life...from the book: ""I wondered if life could be lived more like a good story in the first place. I wondered if a person could plan a story for his life and live it intentionally."" And, the main point of the book: ""A character who wants something and overcomes conflict to get it is the basic structure of a good story."" There is much humor, introspection, reflection, implementation of ideas in this book. And, Miller has some pretty amazing friends...the story of Bob Goff is wonderful in itself. Miller includes God and his religious views in the book. It is not preachy or pushy, it is just part of who he is. And one more quote: ""It's true what Steven Pressfield says: there is a force resisting the beautiful things in the world and too many of us are giving in. The world needs for us to have courage, Robert McKee says at the end of his book. The world needs for us to write something better.""I told a friend of mine about the book over dinner and she said that she felt her life was a good story. I was happy for her and truthfully, jealous. Then she laughed and said maybe it was just the wine. :)I recommend this book and would love to discuss with anyone who reads it!",8,1 comment
1999475,A Million Miles in a Thousand Years What I Learned While Editing My Life,Willie Krischke,289,8,2,"November 2, 2009","A few years ago, Don Miller was a promising young writer with a unique voice and some things to say. And then he had to go and become a conference speaker.I don't blame him; there's a lot of money in speaking at conferences, and not that much in writing a book every 3 years, even if you have one on the New York Times bestseller list. Writers make pretty good conference speakers, but conference speaking ruins pretty good writers.Conference speakers have to tell a joke, or say something cute, or do a little dance every five minutes to keep the attention of their audience, who has just travelled 400 miles and doesn't know yet where their hotel room is or if there's going to be a vegetarian option for dinner. But a writer who tells a joke or says something cute every second paragraph gets old fast. And Miller has that problem - in spakes in ""A Million Miles.""It's not that the jokes aren't funny, or cute, or whatever, it's that you want a more consistent voice, more finely crafted prose, out of a writer.",7,N/A
1999475,A Million Miles in a Thousand Years What I Learned While Editing My Life,Christine,35,4,4,"January 25, 2010","I read Blue Like Jazz, Miller’s first and wildly successful memoir, in what seems now another life and another frame of mind. But Donald Miller is travelling with me in a freakish parallel universe. A Million Miles in a Thousand Years tracks Miller learning to view his life through a camera lens. This hook, life as a story, snagged my inner writer, pulling me through the book as Miller sharpens his point.The book begins as Miller is approached to edit Blue Like Jazz into a movie script, turning his (mainly internal) meanderings into events that happen to a character named Don. As a writer myself, complete with an overactive inner monologue, I appreciated the irony of Miller reshaping his memoir to translate onscreen. Reconstructing his quiet, emotional growth into visible activity seems daunting. Yet realizing that movie moments are made when the character is doing something, not when he’s thinking, leads to Miller’s extraordinary personal growth in A Million Miles.As he begins to edit, Miller posits, “My entire life had been designed to make myself more comfortable, to insulate myself from the interruption of my daydreams.” Instead of continuing that story, Miller swaps it for a new one, testing out action/adventure to start (he climbs the Inca Trail to Macchu Picchu while struggling with weight issues), then drama (his first serious relationship), and finally mellowing into an arthouse flick (he bikes across the country with a group of misfits) to wrap.A Million Miles is about the transition from an easy acceptance of life to scaring yourself out of complacency. Miller’s memorable characters — particularly the vivid Bob Goff — imbue his stories with clarity and an honest, translucent feel that let readers embrace the end lesson.If most of life is forgettable, it follows that what we’ll recall — easiest or most or fondly — are the absurd moments, the unscripted. Miller’s voice has matured, maybe with age, maybe just with the change in story. His weaving, multi-layered tales build a message powerful in its simplicity: Self-editing is within our power.This review, and more like it, on my blog at www.christinereads.com.",6,N/A
1999475,A Million Miles in a Thousand Years What I Learned While Editing My Life,Erin,924,12,3,"November 30, 2020","3.5 stars. Miller's conversational style makes this read smoothly, and he is charming company while he asks interesting questions and uses interesting vocabulary to discuss his ideas. And hey, I'm a sucker for things that explore the concept of how our narratives shape our sense of identity. The subject matter has been approached by many others, and I don't think he adds anything particularly new to the canon, hence rounding down, but the journey was enjoyable.That said, I have to credit this book for giving me an epiphany. The anecdote about about his friend taking action to give his struggling teenage daughter a better narrative (I don't want to spoil it, because it was my favorite part of the book) made me think about my own pandemic parenting. I have one child that has really been discouraged about pandemic life. I've basically gone on parenting steroids to try and fill his need gaps from what he lost (Lots of outdoor adventure, sometimes with socially distanced friends! Homeschooling he enjoys because distance ed was so awful for him! Dropping my free-wheeling hippy ways and doing one of those awful rainbow routine schedules because this child needs structure!), but he still feels like this year has been a dumpster fire. I've realized that while I have been giving him the building blocks of a good story, I have not actually been giving him the narrative to see who he is in this different context. I am trying to be more careful to offer him a narrative during this of who he is (while letting him define himself, which doesn't have an easy answer) - to tell him that he will be able to tell his children stories about how despite the fact a pandemic took away experiences that mattered to him, and it didn't feel great, it didn't stop him from having great adventures, serving others, and learning fascinating things. Maybe it will stick? But I want to give him opportunities to see his life through different lenses, and I want to be more conscious about narrating that to him. ",6,N/A

1999475,A Million Miles in a Thousand Years What I Learned While Editing My Life,Kyle Erickson,326,127,2,"October 7, 2022","This book had some really good lines about the nature of story and about life. Unfortunately, and I don't know how to articulate this in a more polite way, but the author just came across like an idiot constantly. I say this with no malice. Some people are not smart. The author was determined to make himself seem like one of said people. I'm unsure if it was a narrative decision in order to have information relayed to the audience feel as if he was learning at the same time, or if Miller was just honest about how he was a man in his forties who knew absolutely nothing. It felt like every chapter he had to have basic things explained to him. He says he spends most of his time going to movies and then does not understand the most basic, no-shit things about them. He actually calls a scriptwriter back to have him explain to him the concept that ""story needs conflict"" again because he didn't fully understand it the first time it was explained to him. Dude, it's your book - just pretend you already knew some stuff. Leave this part out. Anyway, I skimmed the back half of this book because I was secretly afraid if I read a book about an idiot too closely that I would also become an idiot. Jury's still out. 4/10",5,2
1999475,A Million Miles in a Thousand Years What I Learned While Editing My Life,Crystal,"1,356",48,3,"October 27, 2010","free preview copy from Thomas Nelson publishers. I was so excited when I heard Donald Miller had a new book out, and even more excited when I got the news I was getting a free copy. then I got the book and read it. Oh bummer.The book isn't bad, persay. it's just not life altering for me. Maybe it's one of those subtle books, that I'll find I keep remembering and thinking about later. But it definitely didn't strike me as I was reading it. I felt more like, okay, I'm going to listen to more about how he sat down and had a beer with someone, or how he sat and thought. It just felt like a lot of the book was unnecessary info, that dragged it down so much that I barely noticed when he got to the point about our lives being like stories. It was a little like feeling like I was trapped listening to a friend drone on about boring parts of their life, hoping that they get to their point sooner rather than later.It's an interesting concept, that our lives are like stories. I never thought about it before, and I'll admit it occasionally comes to mind now, wondering what I'm consciously doing with my life, what my plans are turning me into. I just think the concept could have been delivered in a better, more engaging way. I was also disappointed at how little his faith seemed to figure into his discussion. I couldn't, in honesty, include this in my Christian book category. It was more like secular self help, in which the author happens to be Christian. **************************************************note--a year later I was going through my shelves, glanced at this book and though ""huh, Donald Miller. I can't remember what it was about, even though I know I read it. I think I'll go check my goodreads review."" then I do that, and see my comment about how maybe I'll remember this book later. Negatory. have not thought about this even once that I can remember. and the concept isn't that original by now, with others who've done a better job making us be intentional about our lives and the story we're creating.

1999475,A Million Miles in a Thousand Years What I Learned While Editing My Life,John,27,11,4,"February 6, 2011","""Nobody cries at the end of a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo."" That single insight, from the first page of the book, effectively distills the wisdom of 288 pages down into one sentence. In A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, Donald Miller writes of how collaborating on a screenplay based on his life transformed his perspective on life, and then transformed the living of his life. As he thought on the fictional story of his life, he began to see his real life as a story, and that, as the saying goes, is what made all the difference. He thought about the elements of a good story-- conflict, sacrifice, character transformation, and realized that the ""elements that made a story meaningful were the same that made a life meaningful."" And as he was rewriting the fictional story of his life, he realized that his own life was his to write, by intentionally living out what a good story would be. Miller writes in his honest and open style about both his failings and his victories in this memoir, and there is much to be appreciated and pondered over here. I underlined dozens of sentences like the ones above, sentences that ought to be deeply worked down into the soul. Don's story is a good story, but it isn't a great story. Where it falls short of greatness is that Christ is not at its center. Yes, as far as I know Don is a Christian, but his story as chronicled in the book is one that anyone with any belief in God could undertake. I believe that every truly great life story involves the glory of Christ and His Kingdom at the center of it all-- the inciting incident, the conflict, the transformation, the climax-- Christ must be seen as behind all, before all, the center of all, and the purpose of it all. I'd like to hear more of the story of Christ in the story of Don next time around.",4,N/A

I checked it out at the library once and just never even got out of ten pages. But then the recommendation rolled around again and it was strong enough that I thought I would try it. I found it on audio and for probably the first hour or so I thought, ""why in the crap is this book so highly recommended?"" but the further along I got the further along I loved it. I love the idea to consider about ""what makes a good story?"" and ""what story do I want for my life?"" This really has made me think so much about where I am headed, how I want my children to remember me, how I want to spend my time, what story I want to create for my marriage, my career, etc. It's not that you have to have amazing things happen to you to have an amazing story - instead - you just have to choose what story you want and be willing to ""save the cat"" and go through the difficult/uncomfortableness to get the story you want to have remembered. Highly recommend. In fact, please read this so that I can talk to you about it. Pretty please.",4,N/A

If five stars and that exclamation didn't tell it, this was a great book. Donald Miller manages to tell us a lot about our story through his story, especially because he is so honest about his own flaws that have persisted or have even been magnified through his previous success. He is one. He is candid. He is able to maintain a tone that makes the reader believe he is ""just talking"", all the while choosing figurative language that is so perfect that he must have come through dozens of other options before selecting the phrase.Most motivational speaking put on paper would be terrible, but because Miller puts such thought into his craft I can hardly imagine a book outside of the Bible itself that is better able to combine challenge and encouragement.",4,N/A
