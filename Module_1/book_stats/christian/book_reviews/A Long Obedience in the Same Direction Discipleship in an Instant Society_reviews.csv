579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,"Fergus, Quondam Happy Face",932,17600,5,"January 28, 2023","This, GR friends, is THE BOOK that hauled me up from the Slough of post-retirement Despond some fifteen years ago and put me back firmly on an even keel.Where our Heart is, therein lies our Duty. And what a duty! To once again turn our hearts to the task of ascending the hills of Jerusalem, as Jesus did so grimly, at his last Passover.For these are King David’s Psalms of Ascent - psalms that tell a compelling story of once again putting our shoulders firmly to the wheel, ‘keep(ing) calm and carry(ing) on’ - no matter what our media or our enemies may do or say.Sufficient to each day is the evil in it, and these remarkable few psalms are in fact a story of our daily lives as they occur, as we try to ascend arduously through the dark clouds that somehow, always seem to tinge each of our days with a measure of sorrow and regret.If they remind you of the Lord’s last days on earth in the week before Easter you’d be right.Worn out as we may be, it is never too late to seek a better world!If you liked the Biblical street talk of The Message, you’ll LOVE this one - Eugene Peterson’s SECOND BEST Greatest Hit.The Songs of Ascents - surely among King David’s own favourite Psalms - begin right after that monumental block of spiritual granite, Psalm 119 (my perennial fave, with my literary bent!)...After the stylistic and hieratic solemnity of that masterpiece, King David was free to let his childlike emotions pour out once more!So here we have the David we LOVED as a kid - casual and unafraid to dance joyously before the sacred altar of his Judge.And his many enemies don’t get off lightly in his letting loose, either - those spoilsport stuffed shirts who cast their haughty, jaundiced glares upon this young upstart of a king who all his life retained the sybaritic spontaneity of a country bumpkin sheep-sitter!Yes, David is always one of the very biggest stars of the Bible when he reminds us poker faces of our seething differences with our hypocritical daily tormentors, before whom we hold our newly-dealt hand of losing cards with placid feigned indifference!And what better champion of this wonderful beleaguered king than Pastor Peterson, who can so perfectly remind us burnt-out souls of how much like King David we are in our heart of hearts?So, come ON! Be yourself. David is no idealized plaster saint.No, he’s an authentic, honest, open flesh-and-blood friend and mentor.And a long obedience in the same direction is absolutely mandatory for the purification and maturation of our souls!FIVE full stars. THIS will get each of us, no matter how weary, back on her or his feet!",166,7

As such, while in the moment I kept marveling at the nuggets of truth, or questioning some of his assumptions, I now sit back and realize I've done basically the opposite of what he says to do. I rushed. And I'm the poorer for it. I need to track down a physical copy. I really like the way he uses the Psalms of Ascent to trace spiritual obedience. And his point about reading Scripture not for momentary application but to soak in God's word. Oh, and his point about how Christians can be boring but they're family anyway and we're called to participate in the church regardless of how we personally feel. All personally challenging and deserving more contemplation. ",11,1 comment
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Ebookwormy1,"1,778",245,4,"September 22, 2017","I thoroughly enjoyed this devotional on Psalms 120-134, and used it for my quiet time. I read the psalm (each chapter begins with the actual text - a big plus to me), the chapter in the book (which focus' on a theme of the Christian life as presented in the psalm), the psalm in my Bible (different translation) and then the African Bible Commentary on the Psalm.I found this to be a nourishing read. Encouraging. Good. Simple. Principles for Christian life. Not necessary groundbreaking, but walking the well-worn paths of ancient relationship with the God of Israel as revealed in the Bible.Certain chapters hit me very deeply, and i found myself pondering certain quotes in almost every chapter. Other chapters were merely okay, but whether this was due to a change in writing/ analysis by the author, or a reflection of my own internal state, I cannot say.",7,6

579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Kara,271,4,5,"September 3, 2022",This book was so rich... a true treasure. Every believer should read it. I was so challenged and encouraged by Peterson’s words. I am so grateful for his life and his willingness to share what God taught him.,6,N/A
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Oceana,589,719,5,"January 13, 2022","So much wisdom here. Eugene Peterson used the Psalms to discuss various theological aspects to the Christian life such as obedience, grace, faith, and worship. I loved it. Exactly what I needed to read right now. Highly recommend! ",5,N/A
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Jennifer Trzeciak,66,3,5,"March 27, 2021","Oh my. Five stars does not seem sufficient for this book. It has been sitting on our shelf for years and while the title has always intrigued me, I sniffed my nose at reading Peterson because of a negative bias toward The Message. Totally unfair and uncalled for, I know. I am so happy to have been wrong about this man! Eugene Peterson loves his Lord, and his Lord’s people. He has a wonderful way of seeing God’s work in every day life. His use of the Psalms of Ascents as themes for our own walk with Jesus is magnificent, and shows us, as modern day believers, how rich our spiritual heritage actually is. There are nuggets of wisdom and joy on every page, but some of my favorite themes were Providence, Happiness, Hope, Suffering, and Blessing. In several chapters, Peterson remarks on the structure of the Psalm being such that as readers we must remember our past and God’s past faithfulness to his people as a way to fuel our joy and obedience in the present as well as the future. My only criticism is that Peterson is a bit wishy-washy on the idea of eternal security. He says, ”Once you are a Christian there is no getting out of it. It is a non-negotiable contract,” and then follows that with “However true that is generally, and I think it is, there are exceptions.” Texts such as John 10:27-30 and Romans 8:38-39 clear up that issue in my mind. That said, I still wouldn’t hesitate at all to recommend this book. One further comment-I just found out that some of the editions of this book use his Message translation for the Scripture passages. I recommend getting an early edition with the RSV translation used, which is nearly identical to the ESV, at least for Psalms 120-134. ",5,N/A
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Jim,179,32,4,"October 9, 2018","I didn't get as much out of this as some of his other stuff I've read, but anything written by Peterson is required reading as far as I'm concerned. I would follow him around his house and write down everything he said if he'd let me.In this book he teaches through the Psalms of Ascent (120-134). The Psalms are my least favorite book of the Bible because I'm not really an abstract thinker, but Peterson brings them to life. He says ""The Psalms are great poetry and have lasted not because they appeal to our fantasies and our wishes but because they are confirmed in the intensities of honest and hazardous living."" The Psalms of Ascent in particular aren't really guides on how to get from one place to another, but affirmations and celebrations of the realities we actually live in. Songs we sing that keep us going because they remind us of what's real.Another great Peterson quote from the book - ""The easiest thing in the world is to be a Christian. What is hard is to be a sinner. Being a Christian is what we were created for. The life of faith has the support of an entire creation and the resources of a magnificent redemption. ... In the course of Christian discipleship we discover that without Christ we were doing it the hard way and that with Christ we are doing it the easy way. It is not Christians who have it hard, but non-Christians.""",5,N/A
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Becky,215,11,5,"February 22, 2019","My favorite thought in the entire book is this: “All the water in all the oceans cannot sink a ship unless it gets inside. Nor can all the trouble in the world harm us unless it gets within us.”That is a pretty decent summary of the entire book. It’s an honest look at the reality of the current condition of this fallen world, but more importantly, it is a gentle (but insistent) reminder that we are entirely and constantly surrounded, kept afloat, and protected by the presence of our powerful God.“The LORD will keep you from all evil.” Indeed.",5,N/A

579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Candice,281,4,5,"May 3, 2022","This was my first Eugene Peterson book even though I have often heard him mentioned by authors and teachers whom I respect. Two things stood out to me - how well-read he was and how he was able to transmute difficult ideas into something clear. This book is lovingly written for laymen, and each chapter focuses on a theme represented by one of the Psalms of Ascent. I definitely plan to reread this book and explore more of his works. ",3,N/A
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Chris Duncan,32,1 follower,5,"October 24, 2022",This book was incredible. Was a great book in helping see what ministry is about but also just what being a Christian is truly about. Sharing the Gospel with people is great but living it out in your life alongside others is what we are called to do. Ministry isn’t something that happens in a short period of time and as he says “nothing in life that is worthwhile can be acquired immediately”. This is why he says as Christians we are called to a long obedience in the same direction.,3,N/A
579014,A Long Obedience in the Same Direction Discipleship in an Instant Society,Jess,60,1 follower,4,"January 8, 2023","This was slow to get into- mostly because I was living into the opposite of this book's premise. I wanted it to be an efficient prescription to the issue of discipleship. And much like the Bible- much like the Christian faith- it is a meandering and ponderous journey through the songs of ascent in the psalms. By the end, I was attuned to the pace and able to grasp the truth contained. Solid read for those on the journey of life.",3,N/A
