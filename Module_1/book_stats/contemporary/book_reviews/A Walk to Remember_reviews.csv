  Not a proper review. Just me gushing over a book/movie that makes me cry everytime I watch/read it. Beautiful.

35545737,A Walk to Remember,B,319,1898,5,"May 24, 2012","This was my first book by Sparks, and let me tell you, it. was. perfect. It’s so hard writing reviews for books you absolutely love, and this review will not do this book justice, so just bear with me. I was pretty unsure about this book at first, and when I was told by a friend to read a Sparks book, absolutely any of my choosing, I didn’t really want to. But, despite not wanting to read I book by him, because I was being stubborn and thought I would absolutely hate it, I went on my library’s website and looked up Nicholas Sparks. Searching through the titles, the only one that was available was A Walk To Remember, and I took it and started reading it. Let me just say that I am so happy this book was the only one available, because if a started with, let's say The Guardian, I don’t think I would’ve continued reading Nicholas Sparks’ books. Now, back to the story. I knew Sparks is known for writing tear-jerkers, and I knew what was coming at the end. What I didn’t know was how hard it would hit me, and that I’d be crying my eyes out at midnight. Yes, the book is pretty slow moving, but once it gets to the story, you won’t want to put it down. At least I didn’t want to put it down. Immediately after I was done reading the book (and after I was done crying), I jumped on my computer, went on to Amazon and immediately bought this book, so I can read it again. And I will. I will absolutely be reading A Walk To Remember again. It’s a beautiful book, with quite possibly one of my favorite characters of all time (Jamie), and I can only hope everyone I recommend this book to loves it as well. So please, even if you’re skeptical to start reading Sparks like I was, go to your library and ask if they have A Walk To Remember. Oh yeah, and please like it! (And I'm sorry for the crappy and barely-anything-to-do-with-the-book review.)Hey, A Walk To Remember.... Psst... ",231,20

This was my first Nicholas Sparks read and after years of it being recommended to me I finally gave in. I expected a by the numbers, cliche, love story. And it was in a way, but the characters were great and so the journey was great. And sad. You know where this is headed from the very beginning in a way, but it still surprises you at points.And no, I did not cry... I think... Maybe... Manly tears only...",115,16

Although after reading the book I now realise that the movie was tweaked a bit, it nevertheless still retained the essence of the book ❤️. Book or movie? Definitely movie!!",99,13

35545737,A Walk to Remember,Ahmad Sharabiani,"9,568",55500,4,"September 9, 2020","A Walk to Remember, Nicholas Sparks The story starts with a prologue from Landon Carter at age 57. The remainder of the story takes place when Landon Carter is a 17-year-old high school senior. Landon Carter lives in the small, religious town of Beaufort, North Carolina. His father is a genial, charismatic congressman. Landon's father is not around very much, as he lives in Washington, D.C. Landon is more reclusive, which causes some tension in their relationship. Landon's father pressures him into running for class president. His best friend, Eric Hunter, who is the most popular boy in school, helps him and, to his surprise, Landon wins the election. As student body president, Landon is required to attend the school dance with a date. He asks many girls, but none are available. That night, he looks through his yearbook, trying to find an acceptable date. Since nobody else seems to be available, Landon reluctantly asks Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of Hegbert Sullivan, the Beaufort church minister, who accepts his invitation. While Jamie is very religious and carries a Bible with her wherever she goes, Landon (one of the popular students) is reluctant to go to the dance with someone like her. When Landon is threatened by Lew, Jamie comes to Landon's aid, to his appreciation. At the end of the night, he admits she was the best date possible. A few days later, Jamie asks Landon to participate in the school's production of The Christmas Angel. While Landon is not very enthusiastic about participating, he agrees to it anyway. Jamie, on the other hand, could not be happier about her new castmate. Landon knows that if his friends learn about his role in the play, he will be teased relentlessly. One day at rehearsal, Jamie asks if Landon will walk her home, after which it becomes routine. A couple of days later, Eric mocks the couple during their walk home and Landon becomes truly embarrassed to be with Jamie. Meanwhile, Landon continues to learn about all the people and organizations Jamie spends her time helping, including an orphanage. Landon and Jamie visit the orphanage one day to discuss a possible showing of The Christmas Angel, but their proposal is quickly rejected by Mr. Jenkins. When Jamie and Landon were waiting to meet Mr. Jenkins, she tells Landon that all she wants in the future is to get married in a church full of people and to have her father walk her down the aisle. While Landon thinks this is a strange wish, he accepts it. In truth, he is beginning to enjoy his time with her. ...

35545737,A Walk to Remember,Darla,"3,138",447,5,"December 10, 2022","This book is a masterpiece. In 240 pages, Sparks gives us all the feels. Every time I read it, I weep. On your first time through, there are all the surprises in the plot that keep you reading and reaching for the tissues. Then you reread and the anticipation makes those earlier bits so much sweeter and meaningful. Since I first read this book about 20 years ago, I keep comparing the other books from Sparks to this one. So far there have been some good ones--most with many more pages. None has compared with the story of Carter and Jamie from 1958. This is one I treasure. I hope you are as blessed by the reading as I have been.So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.  ~ I Corinthians 13:13",56,12
35545737,A Walk to Remember,Casey,272,121,2,"September 16, 2007","A Walk to Remember details the story of Jamie Sullivan, a preacher's daughter who seems to know everything, and Landon Carter, the boy who would never be tempted by Jamie in real life. The plot is predictable enough, even if you haven't seen the movie. I won't spoil the ending here, but it leaves quite a lot to be desired.I wanted to like this book, since so many people I knew enjoyed it, but I ended up hating it. The material was far too idyllic in some parts, and overly sanguine in others. I could see how Nicholas Sparks fans could like it, but it didn't have enough heart or plot to keep me interested.",49,6
35545737,A Walk to Remember,Krystal,"1,294",338,2,"October 3, 2020","The movie was better.It's not often that I prefer the movie over the book, but it's also not often that I like chick flicks and the movie of this novel really got to me.So honestly it was a bit sad that this book didn't have the rich details that the movie did.That's what it comes down to, ultimately - not enough detail.For those who don't know the plot, the story is told by Landon, who is a bit of a rebel. His dad hasn't been around so he's a bit reckless and wild, and also sometimes quite a jerk. Then he gets to know Jamie, daughter of the local pastor, and suddenly things begin to change.There's also this secret that Jamie has, and the movie kinda spills halfway through, whereas this book left it to the last minute which ended up being frustrating. But I think if you haven't seen the film it will be a real gut-wrenching twist that will give you all the feels you want from a Nicholas Sparks book.I'm not usually into the mushy stuff, but I do really love how this relationship plays out. I love Jamie and how she treats everyone, and there's no pretence to it. She's just such a loving soul, and the way Landon begins to change, just by knowing her, is actually pretty beautiful.But the novel is short so it doesn't quite expand on the love story and so the ending feels a little abrupt and unsatisfying.Overall, it's not a bad book - the characters are great and the story is sweet, but it just wasn't enough to win me over after the brilliance of the film.Read the book before you see the film and you'll probably rate it a lot higher.",48,8
35545737,A Walk to Remember,Sharon,946,182,4,"September 1, 2017","They say opposites attract and for Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter this was true. Jamie was the daughter of a small town baptist minister. Jamie was a sweet, kind girl who liked to volunteer at orphanages and rescue animals. Everywhere she went she carried her bible and she never put on make up and didn't mix with the so called cool kids. Where as Landon was totally the opposite as he was one of the cool popular kids who would hang out with his friends after dark. Hard to imagine, but Landon finds himself dateless for the homecoming dance and as much as he doesn't really want to ask Jamie to go with him as he knows everyone will talk about him, but he figured it was better than not having a date at all. He held no feelings for Jamie what so ever, but that would all change after the dance and Landon would see Jamie in a totally different way. Unfortunately Landon would soon learn something that would turn his world upside down.A Walk to Remember is a beautiful love story which I enjoyed. Recommended. ",47,9
35545737,A Walk to Remember,Jasmin,359,76,4,"September 14, 2010","♪♫♪I'll always remember It was late afternoon It lasted forever And ended too soon. CRY, Mandy MooreThe song Cry, perfectly describes A Walk To Remember. It was short, but it would definitely be etched in my cranium for forever.Who wouldn’t know Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan? In the movie, they were cast as Mandy Moore and Shane West.[image error]I remember it being a hit when I was in high school years ago. I watched the movie and loved it. I knew there was a book, but I only had a chance to read it recently. And I have to say that the book was just as good. Though I have to admit that I found the movie better than the book, but still both had their appeals.Jamie Sullivan, is miss goody two shoes. She’s too GOOD to be real. She gives donations to the poor, goes to the orphanage to volunteer, saves critters on the streets and almost never says “no”. She’s selfless and she was ridiculed for it.While Jamie is the ultimate role model, Landon Carter is the complete opposite. He’s a bad boy, who has a persona that doesn’t give a care about the world. He litters at the cemetery and he’s one of those who ridiculed Jamie.And A Walk To Remember is told by the eyes of Landon. It started with him having to go to the homecoming ball with a date. He would have to die first than be seen with his mom as his date. So he asked Jamie, the last person on the earth anyone would ask. But what started with a necessity ended up as a constant want. He was once ashamed of being seen in Jamie’s company. But who could resist Jamie, when she is so sweet? He just had to please her. And ultimately, he’s fallen hard for her. We see how he was a boy who walked the earth without actually savoring and changing into a man who knew how to count his blessings and relish them for as long as he could.Well, all I could say is: The love story was beautiful while it lasted. Well, I guess we all know that… Spoiler aheadJamie died End of Spoiler. But I swear that Jamie and Landon’s love story would touch my heart for as long forever. AS long as I don’t get amnesia or Alzheimer’s! ",38,10
35545737,A Walk to Remember,Namratha,"1,011",230,3,"October 10, 2013","I am not a Nicholas Sparks fan. I like my love stories with a little more pizzazz, wit and humour. I want the heroines to be headstrong and dripping with pithy comebacks. I expect the heroes to be unassuming to begin with and memorable by the time I shut the book. And most of all, I want...no, I DEMAND a happy ending. So, keeping all these requirements in mind, 
  A Walk To Remember
 is not my cup of tea.And yet, dare I use a dreadful pun? The books had it's occasional *sparks*. It helped that I read the book and watched the movie based on it simultaneously. In a nutshell, the book is about the quintessential bad boy falling for the Reverend's holier-than-thou daughter. It's about cheeky Landon Carter losing his heart to the angelic Jamie Sullivan. It's about one glorious summer in the lives of two teenagers and their journey to a heart-breaking end.Shane West plays Landon Carter in the movie. With the angular thrust of his eyebrows and his devilish smile, Shane West was better than the paperback Landon. Mandy Moore plays the parish's golden girl, Jamie Sullivan. Let's just say that paperback Jamie was better than the celluloid one.Amalgamating the two sources, I give you my favourite moments:Spark #1: This may seem like a very pompous thing for Jamie to say, but taken into context with what her future holds....it's poignant.Spark #2: There's something endearing about the way Shane West nuzzles Mandy Moore's shoulder. It was symbolic of how hormones were not the governing factor in their relationship. And it helps that it was Shane West doing the shoulder-nuzzle.Spark #3: The last line wasn't in the book. But it was a perfect addition. Bible carrying Jamie Sullivan was the girl brimming with faith in God's plan. Falling in love with Landon throws a curve ball that makes Jamie vulnerable. Spark #4: A version of Jamie's favourite passage from the Corinthians that she would have liked to be read out at her wedding. And which does get read at her wedding. It was also, pretty much, the essence of Jamie Sullivan.Spark #5: This line sounds super-cheesy but considering the fact that Reverend Hegbert spent a good part of the book disapproving of Landon Carter and his heathen ways, it was pretty special for Landon to hear this at the end of the story. So yes, the book is not for those who want a fast-paced read. It's not for those who don't want their religion thrust in their faces. And give it a miss if you don't fancy bittersweet endings.But, if you want a change of pace; if you want to imagine an entirely likeable Shane West as the appropriately cast Landon Carter falling fathoms deep in love; if you want to just savour a different facet of love....then this book (and movie) is the one for you.",32,N/A
