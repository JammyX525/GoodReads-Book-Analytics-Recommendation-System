30312700,Alex Approximately,emma,"1,781",42700,1,"November 14, 2022","I’M HONESTLY EMBARRASSED THAT I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS BOOK. Like...I hate books that are cringey, and I hate books that are pretentious, but it’s so rare for me to get the opportunity to hate one that is BOTH!https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co... Ughhhh. God. I’m someone who is extremely susceptible to the charms of an old movie, so when I saw that there was, essentially, a retelling of You’ve Got Mail (a fairly good movie, I guess) in which old film brings the ~romantic interests~ together, I had to be in. And then I read the first 20 pages and cringed unbearably and put it to the side for, presumably, ever.  Yes. I planned on DNFing this book after 20 pages. Just so everyone knows: I never ever do that. EVER. But I instantly knew this book was going to be ALL WRONG. But then I saw a metric sh*t ton (one of my favorite phrases, by the way) of positive reviews. From very trusted sources! And I’m not just talking, like, three-and-a-half-stars “fun fluffy read” reviews. I mean five star, this book is amazing reviews. Unfortunately, my dumb gut was right the first time. So let’s talk about why this book is garbàge, using the Caraval review structure I only whip out when books got a whole lotta sh*t goin' on. PLOT, I GUESS We follow Bailey, who leaves her dirty rotten mom behind in DC to live in sunny SoCal with her cool nerd dad. Bailey is a cinephile, apparently, and writes (flirty!) messages back and forth on a cinema forum with this kid Alex. Guess where Alex lives? In the same small town as Bailey’s dad. Guess when Bailey tells Alex she’s there? Ding ding ding! If you guessed “Never, for reasons that are stupid,” you’re today’s winner!Anyway, Bailey meets this kid Porter, who she “hates” (for all of 20 pages before the whole thing dissolves into sexual tension and smut, never to return). But guessssss whooooo Alexxxxx isssss? Just kidding, you don’t have to guess. It’s in the f*cking synopsis. It’s Porter.Now we just have to wait for the dumbest protagonist in world history to figure out what has been increasingly apparent since, like, page 5. GRUELING. Going to try one of my world-famous character impressions on for size. Here’s Bailey: Wow, am I ever going to find Alex? All I know about him is that he loves old movies, and has best friend problems, and works in his family’s business on the boardwalk within view of the ocean by a stray cat and a churro cart, and doesn’t know if he can go to college because his family needs him, and watches movies at work, and has a coworker who smokes a sh*t ton of weed, and that his girlfriend cheated on him. It surely can’t be Porter, who was in the old movie section of a DVD store, and knows Roman Holiday and old sci-fi movies and a million others, and has best friend problems, and works in his family’s business on the boardwalk within view of the ocean by a stray cat and a churro cart, and doesn’t know if he can go to college because his family needs him, and watches movies at work, and has a coworker who smokes a sh*t ton of weed, and whose girlfriend cheated on him. Semi-spoiler alert: Bailey NEVER FIGURES IT OUT. Her f*cking dad does, and so does Porter. PORTER HAS TO TELL BAILEY IT’S HIM. My God. The sheer idiocy is overwhelming. And to think, her dad told her she’s a “good detective.” In the immortal words of Alicia Silverstone, “As if.” On top of this sort of mind-boggling, makes-me-wanna-claw-my-eyes-out stupidity, this book was also so pretentious and made me cringe so often. I ALMOST DNFED IT TWICE.  I just feel so lied to. All I wanted was a contemporary with some chat logs and old movie discussion, and I was CHEATED ON BOTH FRONTS. I’m so anguished it makes me fear for my caps lock key. The online messages are few and far between, and those that we are granted are less than impressive, and really the best old movie discussion we get is from the quotes at the beginning of the chapters - WHICH INCLUDE FILMS LIKE PITCH PERFECT AND CLUELESS AND EASY A! Don’t get me wrong, all great movies, but not exactly anyone’s idea of vintage!!!!!!!!!!! Ugh. THE WORST TROPE OF ALL TIME And also, guys, in case you needed a disappointment cherry on top of this infuriating sundae, Bailey is so totally not like other girls. The first example arrives at the literal beginning of the book: “It’s not exactly the kind of movie you ask a girl out to see when you’re trying to win her heart - not most girls, anyway.” This is when I put this thing down for a couple weeks. When I returned, rested, rejuvenated, hopeful, I was dealt another blow: “I’m not going to be one of those girls who goes wobbly-woo over a boy and picks at her food.” Poor Bailey. How does she survive as the only tolerable female in the entire universe? NOW THAT’S WHAT I CALL PRETENTIOUS Bailey also sh*t talks the East Coast constantly? And I mean, I’ve grown up on East Coast beaches. And my question is: What the fuck kind of East Coast beach was Bailey going to? Where does the ocean smell like “bleached metal” and make you want to “roll up a window”? Sweet Lord Jesus. It smells like an ocean. It’s great. Maybe that stick up your ass is impairing your sense of smell. And when she’s standing in the f*cking woods, she rants and raves about how that’s just the kind of Quality Smell™ you just can’t get in the east. Um, it can smell like “pine” here too, you ding-dong. Continuing along the path of misguided pretentiousness, this book goes on a rant about Breakfast at Tiffany’s that cut me to my soul. Don’t misunderstand me: Mickey Rooney’s racist-ass character is supremely f*cked. It’s far from a perfect movie. But people are allowed to like it! It’s a classic! My God, this book, man. CRINGE CENTRAL, PARTY OF METHIS SECTION IS UNFORTUNATELY EXPLICITRATED T FOR TEEN SMUT Now let’s talk about that full-on cringe-fest, baby. This book substitutes a plot with gooey looks and smut and I guess what would be considered the stepping stone between flirting and sexting. It’s always just a couple of hot and bothered teens, and it made me SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I don’t like smut much in the first place, but when it’s a first-person seventeen-year-old girl talking about her daydreams and fantasies and masturbation habits and what I can only describe as a passion for getting fingered...it kinda makes me wanna Die™. And God, a light breeze could turn this girl on. Here are some examples of things that spur Bailey into fantasizing in public:- Handholding- The cringeworthy-by-itself phrase “Porter likey”- Extensive injuries from a fight- Porter informing her she should wear sandals more often because he likes her feet (GAG ME WITH A SPOON)-Generally being glanced at, touched by or close to PorterGENERAL STUPIDITY And nowwww it’s time forrrr - GENERAL STUPIDITY! I haven’t had the privilege of writing one of these sections in a hot sec. Longtime, long-suffering followers know that this is the section I use for books that contain small mistakes or irritations that just don’t make sense. In this book, it’s mostly the dialogue. For example, when Bailey meets the forty-year-old cop girlfriend of her father, guess what said cop says? I’d bet you a hundred thousand million dollars you didn’t think it’d be this: “‘I like your brows,’ she finally says. ‘Glamorous.’” THAT’S LIKE A FORTY-YEAR-OLD FEMALE COP SPEAKING TO A TEENAGER. Something that just kind of bothers me: Bailey’s hair is constantly described as being like Lana Turner’s. People even recognize her hair as being in the style of Lana Turner’s. But Lana Turner didn’t HAVE just one hairstyle! She had like, a million pinup girl variations! I just want answers. Which one which one which one? ADDICTION IS THE VICTIM’S FAULT NOW AND THEY SHOULD BE BLAMED AND TREATED LIKE A VILLAIN, IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING So, remember the briefly aforementioned best friend of Porter? The one he “hates”? That best friend’s name is Davy. Davy screwed up his leg surfing so badly he still limps years later. When he was prescribed painkillers, he, like many people, became addicted to the prescription. So when the prescription ran out, he continued to (illegally) source pills. Later, like many people, he moved onto the much-more-affordable heroin. That’s an addiction that is almost impossible to break, and, we’re told, the sh*ttiness of Davy’s family life only spurs him more toward drugs. But none of that is handled with the understanding it deserves.Instead, Davy is treated like the villain of this book. All characters carry nothing but disdain and hatred for him. They act like it’s his fault and he should ~just stop~. When he shows the warning signs of many addicts, like stealing and lying, they blame him. Porter beats the sh*t out of him at one point.  But the worst bit of all is what Porter says to Bailey about his supposed best friend, who is addicted to maybe the worst drug out there. “I’m less worried about him right now, and more worried that you’re sorry you ever gave me your number and will never go out on a date with me, because now you’re thinking all my friends are trash and we really have nothing in common.” Yup. Yes. He’s not that worried about Davy being on one of the most addictive and dangerous drugs in existence. And on top of it, Davy’s “trash” for that addiction.Coolcoolcool. Great book. Bottom line: I said a-nope, nope, nope-ity nope, I said a-nope nope nope-ity nope!",848,226

Definitely one of my favourite contemporary authors now. Bailey was relatable as hell. Especially her way of avoiding shit and not being able to confront her own feelings. I loved that she was into movies, dressed quirky, her relationship with her dad and how she slowly started to open up and accept her flaws. Porter, dear god. Why are fictional boys so damn swoon-worthy? I was getting flustered because of that boy. I wish some of the things she touched upon, i.e. Davey and his drug abuse, Porter’s family, Bailey’s relationship with her mom, was expanded on more. I think it would’ve added more meat to the story and made the characters even more tangible. But, I wanted cuteness and I was overloaded with that. Love is magic, people. (This’ll only last for a short while till I’m back to my cynical old-me, this-world-sucks-no-men-will-ever-live-up-to-fictional-men-like-ever self).

Speaking as someone who in high school have literally run away from who she was currently in 'relationship' with. And this happened more times than I cared to share, suffice to say my friends were utterly baffled. It was très complicated, let us say. And I may or may not still be that girl when it comes to relationships but I digress ....Alex, approximately: super cute & funny YA contemporary with flowing first person narrative writing starring Bailey Rydell, the Artful Dogder & the extra adorable surfer boy named Porter Roth who sometimes more adorkable, but I'll take both, you can keep the change! I loved Bailey's voice a great deal and that's why the book was so enjoyable to me. {{The Scene Stealer Awards goes to *drum rolls* Pete Rydell for being the cutest geeky Dad ever!}}The characters, the writing, the romance all very engaging - there was not a time I thought it boring, which believe you me, not an easy thing to pull off. So, bravo Jenn Bennett whose works I've just now sampled. 
  I get a little flustered but not enough to stop wanting the moon muffins.
↬ Loads of food appreciation in the book which means A.) bye-bye my diet plan. and/or B.) google is my friend (life of a foreigner...) Whatthehell is 'moon muffin' anyway? And who do I have to date to get some?! (Sadly for me, the answer of course is Porter....)

    The one guy Bailey Rydell can’t stand is actually the boy of her dreams—she just doesn’t know it yet.
  
Alex, Approximately is the second book I've read from Jenn Bennett and I think I loved it even more than the first. Both of this author's YA novels have been huge wins for me. I hope she continues to write more of these charming, heart felt, and addicting coming of age stories! Bailey Rydell moves across the country to live with her dad. She has a thing for old movies and is in an on-line group for like minded others. That is where she meets Alex. She's never met Alex, but she's got a bit of a crush on the guy. And he's from the same town her dad lives in. Once she's there, she does everything she can to find Alex (aside from telling him she is in California) and while doing all that, she meets Porter. Porter is not a guy that Bailey would normally go for. He's a surfer, he's a bit cocky, stubborn, and all around just not her type. At least, that's what she thinks at first. It's plain to see that even though these two are opposites in a lot of ways, there are sparks between them. This leaves Bailey conflicted. Porter, the real guy she's falling for, or Alex, her online friend she's liked for a long time. This may be even more complicated than we know... Porter was an amazing character. I loved everything about him. Though I had a hunch about the twist in this book, it didn't make it any less fantastic when it was revealed. I wasn't surprised, but I loved it all the same. Bailey was also a great character. Honestly, there wasn't much I didn't like about this book. It was all around pretty wonderful. I listened to the audio book and enjoyed the narration as well. One of my top favorite YA books I've read this year and one I'd highly recommend!",120,16

But like,,,, I never watched you've got mail UNTIL I DECIDED TO READ THIS BOOK.Anyways, I watched the movie then I read the book and I thought the movie was much better. This is honestly cute and all, but not a memorable read. Just a small list of things I liked:-P O R T E R -He can come marry me like YUM.-GIRLS DONT HATE EACH OTHER AND THEY HAVE AWESOME FRIENDSHSIPS. -I think her name was Grace I forgot it's been a week. -The MC's dad is the cutest human to ever exist.QUESTIONS/DISLIKES:-What was the deal with that drug addict kid?? I really wanted to learn more about his character.-the MC's mom is like not even there once the mc moves-The story was really bland and uninteresting at some points and nothing exciting was really happening. -The romance was kind of meh I'm sorry.Overall, this was not a bad read, but not really the greatest thing either. I know I rated this 4 stars but in reality it's a 3.5 and I'm knocking it down to 3 stars because it was just meh cuteness.-----UPDATE: I just finished watching YOU'VE GOT MAIL AND AHAHAHAHA OH MY GOD SOMEONE FANGIRL WITH ME.

I swear, that was the best/worst decision I ever made. It was 11pm and my eyes were 0.000000000001 seconds away from permanently closing AND THEN I got to some part in the book and was like 
  ""............................well, shit."" 
 Suddenly, I felt like I had enough energy to power 3 suns because my eyes were wide open aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand yeah, I sacrificed my sleep. I'm not even complaining like I just simply couldn't put it down. I had to finish it like what is sleep? I was hooked. 2.

I loved their relationship like awwwwwwwwwwwwwww. This just reminds me of my own dad. So, I'm going to kindly excuse myself and find my dad to squeeze the living daylights out of him. ○ Our MC, Bailey, is what you call an evader. You know those types of people where you're like, ""Where the heck did they disappear off to????"" . She experienced a difficult past that led to her developing trust issues. She is trash for old films and literally knows every damn reference. Like this girl can look at a water bottle and reference it to some film that came out in 1955. Her fashion taste is pretty much inspired by the actresses in the old films. For example: Audrey Hepburn!! ○ I liked Bailey's friend, Grace..........................I lied, I tolerated her. She's that type of friend where you'd tell her something and you'd hear it come out of someone else's mouth. Like no. What's been told to you, stays with you. Besides that, I found her pretty cool, friendly, and very nice.

30312700,Alex Approximately,Alienor ✘ French Frowner ✘,828,3675,1,"February 15, 2021","1.5 stars to 2 stars. Oh boy, how dense can a person be? SPOILER ALERT : Very. But we'll get back to that. Ultimately, Alex, Approximately reminded me why I didn't do so-called ""cute"" YA romance anymore, being that whole annoying package and all : 1) The plot lacked substance. Or, rather, I feel like I've been misled, because somehow I thought that I'd get a)funny online convos, b)some kind of TENSION with the slow realization that appearances can be deceptive, perhaps the characters actually FINDING OUT THE TRUTH OR SOMETHING. No such luck! First there are barely any interactions between Alex (Porter) and Mink (Bailey) online, and they're not what I'd call witty or entertaining. Yawn. Secondly it dragged so. much. and there's only so much horny, teenage sappy romance I can take. And that's all I got! With such a stereotypical love interest! Whaaaat.You wouldn't believe how tired I got of those ""beautiful curls"" and that ""slow grin"" of his. I just. I mean. DEAR GOD. 2) I didn't care for the Not Like Other Girls act that Bailey played on full speed. God, I didn't care for her, period. Indeed there was something really grating about her voice, something I can't pinpoint exactly but that made me wish I'd DNF early. PERHAPS HER PRETENSION. WHO KNOWS. 3) As it's too often the case, important issues are completely thrown off a cliff for the sake of the romance, and I'm not here for that : in Alex, Approximately, we have Davy, Porter's ex-best friend, who's got chronic pain since a surfing injuring and who starts doing drugs. Yet nobody helps him. Nobody. His addiction to source pills then heroine is treated like something that can go away ""if only he'd be willing"" and he's basically characterized as a villain. Sure, he does shitty things and I'm not saying that he should be let off the hook, BUT I was shocked at the amount of victim blaming going on there. And then Porter is some kind of hero because he fights this guy and puts him in the hospital? All while Bailey's thinking things like, oh, he'll need pain medication, that's just lovely, given his addiction and ARGGGG give me a fucking BREAK. But I'm supposed to be okay with that because ""[Davy] is such an embarrassment."" Right. What a decent friend you make, Porter.4) Then there's this time when Bailey's dad tells her that she's a great detective and EXCUSE ME WHILE I CHOKE ON MY DRINK?? She just wanders around, oblivious? I'm calling this girl Bailey from now on alright Oh, and she has that cute little notion that there are different kinds of stalking and that everything is about intent and hmm that's not how it works? 5) I'm not sure that I'm comfortable with the way the """"trust"""" conversations enfolded because somehow their trust looks very much like ""you must tell me everything at all time"" and what happened to keeping some kind of secret garden? Is that not allowed anymore? 6) Don't believe people that tell you that Porter and Bailey's relationship is a hate-to-love romance because a) they """"hated"""" each other for about ten minutes (more like Porter being a prick for absolutely no reasons, but moving on) and b)their hormones got the memo almost instantly : ME LIKEY (are you cringing at this sentence? Because I did). HAVE TO TOUCH. LET'S HOLD HANDS. I was bored out of my mind, can you tell?7) The writing was average and just not that compelling.The only reasons I didn't go with one star are : - there is diversity : Bailey's friend, Grace, whose parents are from Nigeria ; Porter's mum is biracial (Chinese and Polynesian) (also she rocks, I love her) ; Porter's dad is disabled ;- the talk about consent before sex ; - the last ten pages in which we finally get to see what I'd been waiting for during the whole thing, yes yes yes despite the stupid drama, I enjoyed it, at least something HAPPENED, god.All in all, I think that's fair to say that I don't get the appeal. I just don't.For more of my reviews, please visit:

I wanted it from Jenn Bennett's name and my undying love for her other YA book, The Anatomical Shape of a Heart. I went in completely blind and utterly fell in love.Bailey is my kind of girl. She's smart and sort of awkward and would rather be alone the majority of the time. She loves classic movies and dressing like Lana Turner and why aren't we BFFs already. Porter? Yeah, I don't even know where to start with this boy. He's swoony to begin with and then when he actually tries, I was a puddle of goo.There is some of the most delicious banter ever written, swoons, heartbreak, laughs, and maybe a bit of betrayal. Not to mention a few secrets that are revealed in the slowest and agonizing way.This is a book that I'll be reading over and over again: when I need a pick me up or to get out of a slump or just need to grin like a loon the way I am right now.**Huge thanks to Mysterious Galaxy for letting me take an arc from the back room** ",76,5

It's a good enemies to lovers YA contmp. I was totally grinning and swooning while reading. There were some cringey and cheesy parts, but ah, nevermind about those, all i wanted was to feel good. 🥰Bailey (the main character) was kinda relatable. Porter was a real cinnamon roll, a cutie and a softie. I love their romance, the characters' family relationships, and their friendships. I suddenly miss summer and going to beach. im such a beach girl :D“I just want somebody I can have a decent conversation with over dinner.” —Tom Hanks, Sleepless in Seattle (1993)” i also like the entertaning quotes from some movies in every chapter.This book helped me avoid my incoming slump. though i need more from the ending but overall i had fun! buddy read with chaya and julia! {*coughs* sorry for reading in advance eheh}",73,4
