7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,jessica,"2,475",29600,4,"May 15, 2020","i finished this and immediately opened a map of the US to plan my cross-country road trip. i hate driving. what is this quarantine doing to me?? lol.but seriously, this is such a cute story and really showcases different and more obscure parts of the country, which i thought was unique. i really have no idea how realistic it is to go on a four day trip with a stranger, but MM made it work. this definitely has the care-free, summer vibes that i have come to adore about her stories. but it also includes some deeper and more meaningful topics, as well, which i liked. also, i was really impressed with how the relationship between amy and roger developed. its very subtle, as it isnt the focus of the story, but i appreciate that. it feels more natural to me that way.overall, this story is classic MM and i wouldnt have expected anything less.↠ 3.5 stars",167,6
7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,High Lady of The Night Court,135,5031,5,"June 18, 2018","I can’t believe I missed out on so many amazing contemporaries. Lately, I’ve been catching up on all the contemporaries people have liked and I find that I have been quite foolish in not picking up many contemporaries. This book Amy and Roger’s Epic detour, among the other books I’ve read recently, is pushing me to read more contemporaries. I loved reading this book and I’ve never read a book about and in the timeline of a road trip before. I enjoyed everything about this book, especially those little pictures, bills, music playlists and travel entries which make the entire story and the characters feel so very real. Both Amy and Roger are amazing people who we see work through the problems they couldn’t have made their way through without each other. Watching them grow closer and begin to understand each other in ways others couldn’t is beautiful. They grow to trust and rely on each other on this road trip and have a great time making their way through California to Connecticut.The plan was for Roger to drive Amy to Connecticut in order to move to her new house. But Roger doesn’t know that Amy’s father died recently in a car accident she was a part of and that she blames her for it. Amy’s mother planned their trip down to the second, but neither of them want to follow the path with absolutely no fun and decide to take a detour and visit places they have wanted to visit as neither of them has traveled much. Watching them visit places, new and old, and have so much fun makes me so happy. They both have a great time and meet people they would have never met otherwise. They make friends, take bigger detours, and have a journey that was never expected. Amy’s family fell apart after her father’s death. Her mother left her in California for a month and went to Connecticut to put their new house together and her brother is now in a rehab centre. She feels lost and even refers to herself before the accident as a different person but on this adventure she just might pull herself together to realise that there is a life out there for her that she still might thrive in. I think part of the reason she wanted to take a detour is because she seeks that ounce of control on her own life. The day her dad passed away she lost all semblance of control over her life and the truth that she can’t prevent somethings bore down on her. The roadtrip presented her with an opportunity to choose what she wanted to do and she jumped at the chance. We see her work through her issues and make peace with what happened on this brilliant trip of uncertainty, friendship, and fun.I love the characters and all the people they meet. I enjoyed reading the tiny facts about the places they visit and all the things they learn about themselves they probably didn’t before. And even though they are working their way past what each of them have been through and there’s these pages of memories from the past which get very emotional, it’s still a very fun book. I give this book 4.5 stars.

7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,Arlene,"1,155",643,5,"September 9, 2010","Undeniably 5 Stars!!I know what I want to do… I want to go on an Epic Detour… my final destination isn't clear but I have a pretty good idea of the places I want to see.I want to travel to Yosemite and buy a Bear Essentials t-shirt, drive on the Loneliest Road in America and hike a pair of my sneakers on the tree along the way, go to Kentucky and eat a Hot Brown and derby pie, visit Graceland and graffiti the wall and get a pair of Elvis-style sunglasses gold-trim and all, I'll even eat a messy burger and spicy fries in Kansas, all the while driving with the windows down and a root beer by my side. I shall call myself Hillary and my co-pilot will be Edmund. That is my plan... and it is a good one…Wow I have a HUGE crush on this book. It was great and I loved every bit of detail found between pages 1 to 343! Everything that Morgan Matson included in her story was brilliant. The playlists not only have some great songs on them, but they will definitely blow my iTunes budget out of the water for the next few months. I plan on owning just about all of Roger's songs. The menu and food receipts were clever additions... whenever I see cream soda and rootbeer I'll remember Roger and Amy. The Big Bear itinerary made me want to go on a hike, and I don't even mountain hike, but I want to do that now. The scrapbook pages were priceless, and overall Amy & Roger's Epic Detour was absolute perfection!This story has one of the best set of secondary characters I have ever read. They made Roger and Amy's detour inspiring, exciting and enjoyable. Bronwyn and her gift to Amy was endearing. I loved how she took away Amy's camouflage and gave her back a bit of confidence. Drew was spot on with his advice to Roger. Telling him There sometimes isn't' much of a difference between a knight's quest and a fool's errand was the turning point, I feel, for Roger's self-revelation. Leonard was the most aww-worthy video game geek I have ever met. His Make haste! You must save Princess Amy! had me sighing like a lurves-struck goof. Lucien and his decapitated moose head made me crack up! Don't ever stop hedging Lucien... NEVER! Walcott's demo??? I want it!!So pretty much I loved this book. Can you tell??? I loved it to pieces! I suggest you stop what you're doing now and read this book. It's the best fictional journey I've been on in a long time.. so go on... go on a detour you won't regret it. :) 
  Morgan Matson, please write another book. You have an instant fan waiting to read more of your brilliance!

7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,Barbie,109,300,4,"September 4, 2019"," My thoughts in a nutshell This was my first book by Morgan Matson but definitely not the last.I always enjoy a good road trip book. I'm living for a trip when I just sit in a car with my friends and we drive through a country. It is so relaxing and exciting!So I really liked this story. I adored the little drawings and playlists at the beginning of every chapter. The journey was interesting. The two main characters experienced a lot. Their relationship slowly progresses within the book.I can't give this book more than 4 stars because the ending was really unsatisfying. It was too fast. Morgan cut the story in half and she moved on. I don't like it when an author does not explain anything. Secondly, I thought some part were overwritten. I didn't get bored, but I felt a bit much certain scene.Overall, I still recommend it if you like a great book about a voyage. ",134,7
7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,Melissa ♥ Dog/Wolf Lover ♥ Martin,"3,365",9426,5,"February 28, 2019","Reread on audio as I needed a sweet readI am totally in love with this book. The pictures with lists and playlists and thing through out the book is so awesome. I want to go on this epic detour and another thing that I love is the author actually did this epic detour and added some of her own pictures with her in them at the back :-) The thing that started this epic detour. Three months ago Amy's father was killed in a car accident. No, this is not a spoiler because it's on the book blurb. Anyway, Amy and Charlie's (brother) mother decides she's moving them from California to Connecticut to where their grandma lives. Amy's mother got a job teaching at one of the schools. Like, wow... everything you have ever known is just being taken away from you. Amy's brother Charlie is actually in rehab in North Carolina and will join them when he gets out. Amy stayed in California by herself for the last month of school and then her mom decides it would be cheaper for her to drive the Jeep Liberty out to Connecticut. It seems it's cheaper to drive it than hire a company to bring it out. The thing is... Amy doesn't drive, not since the accident. Amy's mom sets it up to where an old childhood friend is going to drive them because he has to come up that way to Philly. Amy handles all of this better than I would have, I just would not be able to leave where I grew up all of my life and where I had all the memories of my father, but I digress. Amy & Roger decide to take a detour and not even go the route Amy's mother had planned out for them. They each had their own places they wanted to go but some were just on a whim. I freaking loved it. They stayed in all kinds of places. Cabins, motels, the jeep, some college friends of Roger's and they just did whatever and went to different places. Amy got to meet some really nice people along the way through Roger and some they met together. They got to find out a lot of things about each other as well. Mostly it was such a wonderful time. OMG! I want to go :-) --->EXCERPT<---Or, more accurately, I ate breakfast. Roger ate the kind of meal usually reserved for holiday dinners and people with tapeworms. Luckily, it was a buffet, and all-you-can-eat, a policy I had a feeling they might be revising after our visit. As Roger came back with his third heaping plateful---this one focused on various meat groups---he raised his eyebrows at my plate. ""Is that all you're eating?"" he asked.They made a few stops for Roger that involved a girl and got some things settled in that situation. Amy wanted to make a stop at Graceland because Amy, her father, and Charlie were supposed to make the trip together before he died. She thought it would be great and in a way it was but it was very sad for her. It also made me cry. She cried too. Through out the whole book you want to know what really happened in that accident. And toward the end when Amy finally tells it all to Roger, I thought my heart was going to break. I could not STOP crying. I felt so bad hearing this and thinking about if that was my own father. The descriptions, just everything was so horrible. There is also one point in the book that I was so disgusted with Amy's mother I wanted to punch her right in the nose. I'm not going to bring that up though. In the end, Amy found herself, even just a little bit, she found something with Roger and she found healing with her brother. And that's all that matters in the long run. MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List",118,15
7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,Aj the Ravenous Reader,"1,005",1049,4,"October 9, 2015","Amy and Roger who were only childhood acquaintances are forced to take a trip that would change their lives, both trying to mend broken hearts for entirely different reasons and with entirely opposite processes. Roger, the explorer tries the best he can to confront the cause while Amy tries her best to avoid it. Both have different goals but at the end of this incredible journey, they come to an unexpected discovery that made their trip an epic detour. I would like to express my gratitude to Ms.Morgan Matson for taking me with Amy and Roger on a road trip that made me see a good portion of America, a country I may only see and breathe vicariously. Virtual it may have been, but I had an amazing experience as the entire story is told in Amy’s point of view via her written record, sort of like a journal of the entire trip from California to Connecticut. The entire account is supported by scraps and tokens from places they have been, a receipt from a diner, a picture of a landmark, a drawing of a tree, maps which are virtually laid out throughout the pages of the book giving it a general sense of authenticity. There are even playlists for every state they go to. It was certainly believable and entertaining. The characters are as genuine as the story. There is something simple and yet very affective with the way the author presented Amy and Roger. They are ordinary people we could easily identify with trying to get on with their lives. It amazed me that Amy despite being a very modest young woman can be very open-minded and perceptive of realities. Roger on the other hand, while I found him very unattractive during the good first half of the book ( not physically because he is cute and sweet, it’s something else, read the book; it may also just have something to do with his name being the same with that of my boss! Ick!^^ )…as I was saying, Roger despite his flaws is still a very well developed character. As already mentioned, he has always wanted to be an explorer and because of that he has to do everything he can and use up all his resources to discover what he really wants or as it turned out, does not really want (again, read the book to know what that is^^)  “There sometimes isn’t much difference between a knight’s quest and a fool’s errand”  	And despite being so hung up with his feelings for a certain someone who clearly wants nothing to do with him, I still admire his beliefs and principles. 
   It’s really not about the destination. It’s getting there that is the good part. 
 Another thing that is great about this book is that even the minor characters that have little roles in the story are well developed and significant. It is mostly the minor characters that served as catalysts to the MC’s important decisions. Bronwyn at Colorado Springs for instance has a lot to do with Amy’s change of disposition.   If you don’t feel great on the inside, just look great on the outside and after a while you won’t be able to tell the difference. Walcott and Lucien helped Amy tremendously in a very touching kind of way without them realizing it, while Drew somehow helped Roger see a bit more logic.  Tomorrow will be better. But what if it’s not? Then you say it again tomorrow. Because it might be. You never know right? At some point, tomorrow will be better.  Many might feel otherwise but I liked how the story slowly progressed because it gave the reader plenty of room to grasp the underlying meanings of the story. It also gave the story a more realistic effect and allowed for more detailed depictions of the different states, cities and towns Amy and Roger saw. Overall, this is a beautifully written story of hope, moving on, inspiration and discovering relationships. This truly deserves to be read. It may not be epic, but it is a sweet, touching and memorable read. ^^",92,42
7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,emma,"1,781",42700,2,"January 9, 2018","So before I start this review, I have to say - I am legally and morally and philosophically and physically obligated to declare to you all - I love Morgan Matson so much. She could track me down, tell me The Office is a bad show, and punch me in the nose, and I would still continue to buy her next book.She’d be wrong about The Office, and I would maybe cry out of confusion and being punched by someone who isn’t my younger sister, but man she’d stay on that fresh auto-buy authors list.She has written the most consistently good contemporaries out of any author I know of. I am exceptionally nervous about picking up her books again in the Great Reread Extravaganza of 2017, because I HAVE SO MUCH TO LOSE. She is the last untarnished name on my once-YA-filled list of fave authors.We are not off to a good start.This is Morgan Matson’s first book (I wanna reread them in order), and we follow Amy, whose father recently died. Her mom moved to Connecticut, so Amy (who no longer drives) has to drive out from California. This is where Roger comes in! He’s a childhood friend who has to spend the summer with his dad in Philly (PHILLY REPRESENT!) so he does the driving.TALKIN’ BOUT THE GOOD STUFF-ROAD TRIP!!!!!!!!!!!!I am such a sucker for road trip and travel plotlines. I loved the travel aspects of this SO MUCH. Get me in that car, baby! (Except no. I’d be such a third wheel. Or should I say...seventh wheel? Get it? Because there are four wheels on the car? Follow for more car-related humor.) There was a scrapbook and stuff in this and it was real cute.-Morgan my GIRLEven Morgan Matson’s worst book is still not a one star level of bad.-THERE ARE PLAYLISTS IN THISI like approximately 1.2% of the songs in those playlists, but still fun.Okay, and the stuff that was not as great-it honestly feels like an alien wrote this bookLike...this felt SO WEIRD. It will be really annoying if I can’t substantiate this point beyond that statement, but like. I might not be able to. This just felt slightly…off. I’m going to chalk it up to first-book experience (even though she’d already written another book under her pen name by this point right???) and trying to capture that evasive Quirky Teen Tone and move on.-bonkers longOkay, wait. I just checked and it’s only 344 pages. Yet I have “SO LONG” written in my notes approx 3 times. Maybe this is just my cute fun adorkable way of saying “the plot is weird! This felt long!”-???????????Speaking of my cute fun adorkable ways of saying things (and I hope you all know I am using the word “adorkable” ironically, because wow what a horrible word), the English translation of that series of question marks is “there were so many weird details in this book that I assumed would come back into play, because otherwise they were so random and strange and pointless that my entire existence would seem unnecessary, but then they didn’t and now my life on this planet is sans purpose.”-kind of flat charactersOr maybe they were just boring? It’s kind of hard to tell if a character has no personality because they’re boring or has no personality because they weren’t given one by their author-god. Although I guess the two things aren’t exactly mutually exclusive.-what is moneyI want to move into this universe, where even the nicest of hotel rooms cost a mere $99 a night, and everyone can live their fullest lives on a diet of fast food and convenience store candy for eternity.-so many typosMaybe I have an early edition or something? But this is more riddled with typos than when I wake up in the middle of the night and try to type a reminder on my phone and end up, like, Snapchat messaging a girl from my junior-year science class three fragmented sentences that probably aren’t, technically speaking, even in English.-just...not compellingThe characters: not compelling. The relationship that buds between them: not compelling. Their backstories: not compelling.-THE ENDINGI hated it and that’s all I have to say here. That is all I will say. The only statement I will give. No further comment. Point: concluded.Bottom line: this book is on the best subject (road trips) and by the best author (I love you Morgan) and is, like, shockingly unlikable, considering.",84,5
7664334,Amy  Rogers Epic Detour,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,3,"October 29, 2010","I am not a big fan of formulaic, Sarah Dessen-type summer YA romances, but the reviews of Amy & Roger's Epic Detour were so glowing, I wanted to give it a try. I did enjoy it, as much as I can enjoy a story that employs such genre cliches as makeovers and two teens sleeping in the same bed because, oh my!, there are no other options available. The book is cute and sweet, engaging and a very quick read. The main characters, albeit fairly superficially drawn, are nice, likable people. Although Amy is in a state of grief over her father's death, her narration, to my relief, never becomes an overblown angstravaganza (like, let's say, Revolution - another YA novel about grief and guilt). Unhealthy, stalkerish and abusive relationships are not promoted here. The format is great too, it is sort of scrapbooky, with tons of notes, pictures, and receipts. I have to say, however, some of the scrapbook pages are not inserted into the narrative very well, they interrupt the flow of the story. But it's a minor flaw.As for negatives, they are mostly genre-related - the story is fairly predictable, the characterization is basic and the dialog is not as interesting as it could have been. My major beef with the novel is the hook-up scene in the end (it's fade-into-black BTW). Amy's first encounter with her college BF is handled well, but when it comes to Amy's tryst with Roger, the author never explores the emotional implications of non-committed sex. Why would Amy feel differently about sex this time is unclear to me, after all she was in love with both guys. I wish this scene would never have been in the book, but I guess the genre requirements called for it?Anyway, what I am trying to say, is that after reading YA authors like Melina Marchetta, it's hard for me to sing praises to this particular YA novel. But readers who enjoy sweet, inoffensive, wholesome stories written by Siobhan Vivian, Elizabeth Scott and Simone Elkeles, will definitely love this book. If you are looking for another road trip type story, I recommend Paper Towns, which is much more fun and less cliche-ridden.",68,13

And all I'm saying it that you never know how much time you have.""I have being sitting here trying to think of what to say about this gorgeous book. I’m not sure why I am finding it so difficult because I LOVED EVERYTHING about it. The amazing characters, the travel journal entries, the play lists, the quotes at beginning of each chapter, the menus, photos and all the other added little extras. But most of all the heart warming journey that it took me on. I can’t do a review that will give it the praise it deserves. So I think it is best that you read this book yourself (like right now!!!) to experience an unforgettable road trip .",65,6
