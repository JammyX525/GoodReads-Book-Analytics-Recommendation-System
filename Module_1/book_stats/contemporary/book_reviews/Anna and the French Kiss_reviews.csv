6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,"Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies",832,39900,1,"April 3, 2014","
  “I cheated on her every day. In my mind, I thought of you in ways I shouldn’t have, again and again. She was nothing compared to you. I’ve never felt this way about anybody before—”
What's the saying? Once a cheater, always a cheater? Oh, the fucking hypocrisy.There were many things I wanted to do to Anna Oliphant throughout this book. Some of them involve a bottle of choloroform, a shovel, and an unmarked grave. Mostly, I just want to bring Anna in front of the US Congress as an example of how the US educational system has grievously failed our students. To be frank, Anna Oliphant is a motherfucking idiot.Yeah, I guess you could say this is a sweet romance, but it's not the good sort of sweet. It's the ""Oh my god, why did I eat that entire package of Oreos? I DON'T EVEN LIKE OREOS!"" sort of sweet. It's sickening, and best in small doses, and I still feel like I need an internal cleanse after spreading the reading of this book over several days. The good thing about it is that this book isn't the sugar-free type of sweet, so there were no anal explosions. It wasn't the worst contemporary I've ever read, but this book was tremendously annoying and I simply do not understand the hype. I know many of people enjoyed it, and I can see why. Anna is the sort of character that grows on you, much like mildew, or herpes. Once you get used to having it, it doesn't really bother you much anymore.I'm not opposed to romance. I love romance, but I read this book hoping to be swept away by a romance. Instead, I was sucked into a whirlwind of idiocy.Oh, the Stupidity!!: 
  The only French word I know is oui, which means “yes,” and only recently did I learn it’s spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e.
People like Anna Oliphant is the reason why everyone hates Americans. Anna is 17, and she is a moron. She is the epitome of the stupid, ignorant, egocentric American. For fuck's sakes, she thinks there are motherfucking mimes on every fucking corner in France. She thinks that people go watch mimes as an everyday pastime!
  I’m going to be sick. I’m going to vomit that weird eggplant tapenade I had for dinner, and everyone wil hear, and no one will invite me to watch the mimes escape from their invisible boxes, or whatever it is people do here in their spare time.
I'm sorry, but I'm inclined to judge anyone who doesn't know that 
  oui
 is spelled o-u-i and not w-e-e. It's one of those foreign words that isn't even fucking foreign because it's so fucking common. Oui is yes in French. Si is yes in Spanish. It's one of those words that's so fucking commonly used that you have to be a complete birdbrain not to know!Anna is terrified of anything foreign, although to me, France really isn't that foreign or exotic, but I didn't grow up in Atlanta. Is Atlanta really that ass-fucking backward? Is Atlanta really completely isolated from the rest of the world, despite being one of the biggest cities in the US (Anna's words). Do they not have paninis in Atlanta?
  “Where have you been all my life?” I ask the beautiful panini. “How is it possible I’ve never had a sandwich like this before?”
Not only is she ignorant, she has no survival skills. Anna is in Paris, attending a school for Americans. Fucking everyone speaks English, the French teachers speak English. Anna is terrified of getting food in the cafeteria and avoids the cafeteria for weeks because she doesn't know how to order food.Let me tell you a brilliant way of ordering food, in any language. You smile, you make eye contact at the desired food, you point, you nod. It's motherfucking universal.I hate to say it, but if you're a pretty girl, you can get anyone's help (most likely a guy, but often another girl, too) just by looking cute and helpless and tilting your head at an angle (guilty as charged). It ain't feminist, but it works when one is desperate, and the fact that Anna doesn't have the fucking common sense to do this instead of hiding in her room for weeks like a motherfucking pussy doesn't bring her up in my estimation. I'm not judging Anna for being shy. Anna is not shy. I was a shy, shy teenager. Anna is incompetent. There is a difference between incompetency and shyness.After weeks and weeks of going to classes, of learning French...Anna doesn't know how to fucking spell ""please"" in French.
  Mer is next in line, and I transcribe her speech phonetically.Oon ploss see voo play.
That's suppsed to be une place, s'il vous plaît.Her impression of Paris is one with like, blah blah Marie Antoinette and that really short dude, like, I think his name is Napoleon? You know, like, the one on the horse in that painting by that dude? And oh my god, the Moulin Rouge, and that cute little movie with the little girl in the yellow thingy! Madeline!And this is a chick who wants to be a film critic when she grows up.
  My dream is to study film theory in California. I want to be our nation’s greatest female film critic.
Although judging from the way she thinks, I think she's more suited to a career writing for the tabloids, the type with the sort of ""PRESIDENT OBAMA CAUGHT IN INTERPLANETARY ORGY ALONG WITH PUTIN AND MERKEL"" headline rather than as a film critic.
  I wonder if Matt is a better kisser now that he has someone more experienced to practice on. He was probably a bad kisser because of me.Oh, no.I’m a bad kisser. I am, I must be.Someday I’ll be awarded a statue shaped like a pair of lips, and it’ll be engraved with the words WORLD’S WORST KISSER.And Matt will give a speech about how he only dated me because he was desperate, but I didn’t put out, so I was a waste of time because Cherrie Milliken liked him all along and she totally puts out.Oh God. Does Toph think I’m a bad kisser?
Anna, Anna, ANNA!!!!!: So beautiful without knowing it!! So perfect! So adorably fucking clumsy! She even looks gorgeous when she falls flat on her fucking face!
  ""You’re beautiful.”I trip and fall down on the sidewalk.I look away as he takes my hand and helps me up. “I’m fine. Fine!” I say, brushing the grit from my palms. Oh my God, I AM a freak.“You’ve seen the way men look at you, right?” he continues.“If they’re looking, it’s because I keep making a fool of myself.”
I've seen this before. And it ain't cute. Spare me the whole adorkable thing. I don't like Zooey Deschanel, and I don't like Anna. It just looks like she's trying too fucking hard, and the cute but oh-so-clumsy trope is just so fucking overplayed right now. I wash my hands of it.It's not blatant, but the relationships between the girls in this book are meant to portray Anna as the good one, the best one, the most adorakablest girly girl in the whole wide fucking world. Rashmi is ""Rash."" Cute. I don't think so. Mer is just a little chubby. Volleyball player chubby, but it's ok ^_^; Amanda the slut, Amanda the bitch. And Anna. Anna is just so good because you know, she feels really bad that Etienne likes her, so she does everything she can to make Mer not jealous. It's not Mer's fault that she's not good enough for Etienne! And boy, Saint Anna keeps reminding us that she's a good person!And poor Ellie. Poor Ellie, Etienne's girlfriend. But surely, it's ok for Etienne to cheat on Ellie with Anna if she looks like a slut, right?
  Slutty nurse. I don’t believe it. Tiny white button-up dress, red crosses across the nipples. Cleavage city.
CHEATING IS OK IF YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS A BITCH: That's the message that this book sends. Oh, that Ellie. That stupid, stuck up Ellie. Ellie who thinks she is better than everyone else. Surely it's fine if Etienne seeks comfort elsewhere if his girlfriend is a cold fish, a stuck up snot, right? No. I don't fucking think so. How about you break up with her FIRST? Just because a girl is a jerk doesn't mean she deserves to be cheated on. I do not appreciate the way this book sends the message that it's morally acceptable to cheat on a girlfriend who neglects you! But it's morally acceptable to cheat on her if you feeeeeeeeeeeeel bad about it, right? Fuck this shit.THE CHEATING: And yes, it is cheating. What do you call this?
  ""I said you were beautiful. I slept in your bed!”“You never made a move! You had a girlfriend!”“No matter what a terrible boyfriend I was, I wouldn’t actually cheat on her. But I thought you’d know. With me being there, I thought you’d know.”
Ok. Etienne has a girlfriend, Ellie. Etienne holds hands with Anna. He is still with Ellie.
  It’s nice holding hands. Comfortable.I wish friends held hands more often, like the children I see on the streets sometimes. I’m not sure why we have to grow up and get embarrassed about it.
You know why? Because you wouldn't like it if Etienne held hands with another girl if he was dating YOU. Fucking hypocrite.Friends don't sleep in each others' beds.
  I mean I didn’t SLEEP sleep with him. Obviously. But I slept with him.I slept with a boy! I burrow back down into my sheets and grin.
And that boy has a girlfriend. And then you do it again. While he still has a girlfriend. While you have an almost-boyfriend.You make eye contact and blush at each other in a theatre. While he has a girlfriend.You kiss each other. While he has a girlfriend. While you have an almost-boyfriend.You flirt with each other. While he has a girlfriend. While you have an almost-boyfriend.I don't see this relationship lasting very long.","2,795",359
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Nina ♥,94,673,5,"November 13, 2012","I found this online...NOW WHY COULDN'T THIS BE THE ACTUAL COVER?St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. St. Clair. ST. CLAIR!!!!Can’t I just fill this review with his name instead of explaining how much I effing LOVED this book and trying to describe in vivid detail how beautiful and amazing and gorgeous and sexy and adorable and cute and sweet and perfect and totally smoking HAWT St. Clair is?Asdfghjkl <--- this is me being speechless. I just…I loved, loved, LOVED this book. I’m positively utterly, totally, absolutely completely, undeniably IN LOVE with this book. Just thinking about it makes me giddy. Seriously. It makes me wonder “why don’t my parents send me to France?! I want to find my own Etienne, dammit!” Sigh. Just thinking his name makes me swoon.Okay, I’m probably acting like an annoying fangirl right now, but can you blame me?! I’ll try to keep this review short, before I go into complete fangirl mode (which scares even me).I loved the characters. Every single one of them. They weren’t there just to paint the background, they all had depth and each a different personality. Anna was an awesome MC. She was so amusing and comical, even when she was angry; you kind of want to annoy her just to see her reaction. She has a wonderful dad (who cares if he’d a dick? He sent her to freaking PARIS. And he meant WELL) who sends her to School of America in Paris (SOAP), which is a boarding school. There, she meets a couple of students—Meredith, Josh, Rashmi, aaaaaand St. Clair *swoon*—who immediately befriend her. Unfortunately—or fortunately—she starts having feelings toward the totally gorgeous, off-limits Etienne St. Clair (okay, I’ve learned to say his name without completely hyperventilating, that’s progress). Not only does he have a serious girlfriend, but Meredith—the one who immediately befriended Anna and was kind and helpful to her from the beginning is also crushing on St. Clair. I totally get Anna. I mean, DUDE, HE HAS A BRTISH ACCENT. And he speaks French! That alone should make you fall in love with him within the first five minutes of meeting him. If only he were real. *le sigh* I would positively run to Paris, find him, snatch him away from Anna, grab his hand and run like hell. Which is sort of kidnapping and illegal, but WHO CARES? I mean, he’s St. Clair. Totally understandable. *pout* BUT HE’S NOT REAL. *BAWLS*Gah, he’s just so perfect in this totally realistic way. And so sweet (did I already say that?). His love for his mother and friends makes me love him more.I need to stop. I’m already feeling light-headed and woozy from thinking about it. Don’t worry, normal symptom after reading this book. So, yeah. Read it, if you haven’t already. Don’t let the blurb fool you, it might sound cliché, but there is NOTHING cliché about this book. It unique and one of the best books I’ve ever read.Sigh. Gosh. I better stop or I’ll start blabbering “Anna! France! French kissssssss! Paris! St. Clair! St. Clair! St. Clair! St. Clair! I LOVE YOUUUUU!”*patting myself on the back for having so much self-control*I hope the companion novel is just as good as this. Please make it good, Mrs. Stephanie Perkins. I will forever be your slave.Oh, and I have a sneaking suspicious that the third book will be about Isla Martin and Josh.BTW, this is my version of St. Clair:ISN'T HE YUMMY???""I love you as certain dark things are loved,in secret, between the shadow and the soul.""","1,104",150
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Barry Pierce,531,7070,1,"July 18, 2014","When I was four, I fell off a tree. I hit the ground face first. What I didn't know was that there was a very small, sharp root sticking out of the ground at the base of the tree. It went through my cheek. I went to the ER but had to wait until 2am because it was a busy night. I sat there for hours in that ER with a hole in my cheek. When the doctor finally saw me he thought that since it was a busy night and there were so many people in the ER that he would just sew up my cheek without having to wait for an anesthetic. And he did. He sewed my cheek back together with no pain relief. I have never experienced pain like that again in my life. Until now. Anna and the French Kiss was more painful than that night in hospital. It is a lifeless, desolate, lump of a novel. Its only purpose in this world is as a gauge by which we measure bad novels. This is the bottom of the gauge and Twilight is at the top. Anna is the stupidest person I've ever come across in fiction. She is a self confessed film buff and hopes to one day become America's leading film critic. She obviously must know A LOT about film then eh? *sigh* She's a supposed film buff but yet knows nothing of Paris. PARIS. The home of fucking film. At one point in the novel she is genuinely SURPRISED that Paris has cinemas. FUCKING CINEMAS. How can she be so incredibly ignorant of the place where film was fucking invented and know literally nothing of French cinema BUT YET call herself a fan of film? Ridiculous. She eventually actually goes to the cinema a couple of times but lo and behold what does she watch? American films. She in the home of film and she watches American films. I can't deal with this girl. Oh but let us for one second talk about the love interest. Mr. My Name Is So French It's Borderline Racist Étienne St. Clair. He is literally every ""male love interest"" YA cliche rolled into one festering tumour of a character. He's American BUT has a British accent, he has messy hair BUT his room is meticulously clean, he's book smart, smells nice and is probably the Second Coming of Christ. He is UNBEARABLE. He's like Augustus Water but this guy doesn't have the common courtesy to die at the end. How rude.I hated everything about this novel. It felt unresearched, rushed, and in places, dumbed-down. It is written in a style that I can only describe as ""unemployed Sex and the City screen writer"". I wish this novel came with a warning, ""Keep out of reach of children, and teenagers, and adults, dogs, garden gnomes, your grandmother, school janitors, priests, gibbons, and especially anybody who lives in Paris because this novel is an insult to their city"".I'll finish with a quote from one of my favourite film critics Roger Ebert (who gets a mention in this novel and I'm pretty sure he's turning in his grave because of it). I'll manipulate the quote a bit but the sentiment still prevails. ""This book doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This book isn't the bottom of the barrel. This book isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This book doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.""","3,005",320

6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,emma,"1,781",42700,2,"October 25, 2022","Is there nothing that this godforsaken year will not take from me?Is nothing sacred? No offense too far?I am suffering. In fact, I was already suffering. “Rereading my favorite book from when I was 15 for the sixth time” does not exactly scream ~mentally well~. And yet the universe must have decided I deserved more suffering for, like, my middle school Justin Bieber phase when I once responded to my enemy in eighth grade chemistry’s accusation that JBiebz was auto-tuned with a specific moment when his voice cracks in a song...because I have been dealt another stroke of tragedy.In other words, I f*cking hated this.This book, which has been my problematic fave for like eight years or something absurd like that, was suddenly abhorrent to me. My GO-TO COMFORT READ. My FIRST EVER BOOK BOYFRIEND.It’s all gone. What do I have now?Just kidding. It’s honestly a really good move for my character development that I have one less reason to say the term book boyfriend. With every year I age that grows more disturbing.BUT I AM STILL UPSET.Not least because I must announce that I have been formally replaced in my role as “dumbest bitch alive.” in an unprecedented move, the position has been given to Anna Oliphant, a fictional character, for as yet unmatched achievements in the field of being a stupid idiotThe only word this bitch knows in French is oui and she thinks it’s spelled wee.WEE.Make the pain stop.I always liked this book because I love French and I love swoon-worthy romance, but I’m not sure how in the past I missed the fact that this book trades in stereotypes and my least favorite tropes.Cheating! Girl hate! Hot popular people who are mean for no reason!And Anna is a bad friend!!! She spends all her time at home with Etienne!!! Including calling him from the car while her friend is driving her!! Bad manners! If I did something like that I would think about it when I’m having the 2 a.m. anxiety spirals every night for the rest of my life!!!And Etienne cheats on his girlfriend!!! And says he’s cheated on her in his head every day since meeting our protagonist!!!Also, why did I even like the French aspect of this? So many things that didn’t need to be defined are defined - crepes, “Le Jardin de Luxembourg,” basic French terms. I felt like I was being mansplained an entire language and culture by someone in their third week of Français 101.Which I guess I was.Bottom line: Going to start publicly apologizing for wrongdoings of my past in an attempt to get the universe to give me a f*cking break.To begin, I am sorry for the time my sister had just gotten a new Barbie and I wanted it so I began playing with a piece of trash I found on the ground and talking about how cool it was until she gave me the Barbie in exchange for it.-------------------updated pre-reviewhave you ever reread an old favorite because you needed a comfort read and then hated it? it is a fate i would not wish upon my worst enemy. (my worst enemy is currently stephanie perkins.)updated review to come / 2 stars :o-------------------rereading updatesi used to love this book because i thought the love interest was a dreamboat, but now i know that if i want a short guy who cheats on his girlfriend i can just go outsidehave decided to retire from reading new books. will only be rereading old favorites with lily--------original reviewthe book i thought i would never review!!!whenever people comment on my one star reviews and are like, i know this book is trash but i love it anyway, my internal response is usually:but...this book is trash and i still love it.there's a lil bit of emotional cheating in this, which i literally always hate. there are a couple girl-villains, which, also terrible. it's cheesy and it's all drama all the time and the main character should annoy me and it's lowkey that weird cliché of bad writing everywhere wherein friendships fall instantaneously into place.BUT LITERALLY NONE OF IT GETS ON MY NERVES. THIS BOOK MAKES ME HAPPY EVERY TIME I READ IT.for starters, this is my number one book boyfriend of all time who will never be usurped he is the light of my life and the joy of my universe. this is my checklist for people who are allowed to flirt with me:-french-also british-wears boots-funny-devastatingly attractive (obviously)-named something amazing, like, oh, i don't know, 
  ETIENNE ST. CLAIR
please do not consider any sort of non-platonic interaction with me if you do not check all of the previously-listed boxes.literally the only thing that prevents étienne st. clair from utterly-perfect status is the fact that he is not tall. but the amazing thing about works of fiction is that i can pretend his alarmingly short stature is neverever mentioned. memory repression! woohoo!this book also has: movie talk (which i like even though i am far from a real-life cinephile). france (WHICH I LIKE A LOT). more specifically, paris (EVEN BETTER, I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A CLICHE, I'LL ALWAYS FEEL SUPERIOR BECAUSE I'VE TAKEN FRENCH CLASSES FOR SEVEN YEARS AND BEEN THERE). boarding school!!! incredible drama which i lOVE (i am always such a sucker for a will they/won't they, even if the answer is clearly ""they will""). europe descriptions and touristy places and texting and groups of friends and french food and just alarmingly great stuff.i need to reread this soon to clear its horrendous sequels from my weary mind.bottom line: this book is so stupid and also my favorite ever!!!!(this is part of a project i'm doing in which i review books i read a while back. i'm doing just as badly at it as expected.)",527,57
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Zoë,328,66400,5,"June 21, 2015","Update after reading this book for the THIRD time:Etienne. ETIENNE. The boy of my dreams (well...second place after Will Herondale, but still, that's a high honor). Stephanie Perkins is one of my favorite YA contemporary writers as she has this way of writing books (which really sound SO cheesy plot and title-wise) that leaves you in a puddle of happy tears and hormones after the last page. This book has an inexplicable quality that even after reading the book multiple times, I can fall in love with the characters again and again and it feels like the first time.---The best romance book I've ever read! This read is not only completely and utterly adorable, it is incredibly relatable and witty. I love how Stephanie Perkins wrote each character and how all of the characters will tie together in her three books. I can't wait for Isla and the Happily Ever After to come out!",430,15
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Emily May,"1,921",29000,4,"August 12, 2016","This is one of the cutest feel-good teen romances I have ever read. It has a bit of everything that you want... humour, a likeable protagonist and a completely swoon-worthy guy called Etienne St. Clair. You could fall in love with the name alone, even without the fact that he's sweet, kind, honest and nothing at all like any of the English boys I grew up with. It's a very cute book, a very nice book, neither is a bad thing but if I start mentioning words like 'cute' and 'nice' in a review you can guarantee two things: a) I liked it. b) It's not a 5 star novel.I do understand completely why people love it, but it was nothing new or unusual and didn't take me to new places emotionally or intellectually. I'm not trying to discourage people from reading it, in fact I would greatly stress that it is a delightful experience, very very pleasant to read and never challenging or mind-boggling at all. I spent my entire Sunday completely submerged in it's sweet romantic pages and could have sighed with contentment at the end. There are problems during the novel but everything works out, everyone's happy and no one dies. It's the exact opposite of the novels Anna's dad writes.Anna is a simple average teenage girl who finds herself shipped off to an American boarding school in Paris; despite the trip to France, most female readers will relate to Anna... all she really wants at this point in her life is to hang out with friends, kiss a hot boy and get asked to prom (and eventually go to college). It's hard to define exactly what it is I love about Anna, but I understood her and recognised a lot of what she felt from my own experiences during high school. Though I like characters that are new and different, Anna's familiarity made her all the more relatable and likeable.Also, Etienne St Clair is damn sexy! Even though I'm immune to the English accent thing because I live here, (with the exception of Spike in Buffy) I completely fell for the guy. It's so so nice and refreshing to have a male love interest who isn't a douche - I've missed that. And Etienne is adorable, he even blushes! So maybe he happens to be a little unrealistic... But if you want honest depictions of the teenage male, you can read some Melina Marchetta, which I would highly recommend that you do. But this novel wasn't about honesty, it was about enjoyment. I get that and I appreciate it. Thank you Ms Perkins for such a lovable read!Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr",317,40

6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Caitlin,134,2,1,"June 12, 2021","So, Anna is forced to go to boarding school in Paris (I know! Poor bébé) and she crushes on a guy who already has a girlfriend. They flirt and obsess over each other while he is still dating the other girl. To add icing to Anna’s miserable cake, she is then forced to get mad at her friend who does something despicable: her friend dates a boy that Anna thought liked her instead. Life is just not fair. I gave this book one star because:1)	Anna is a whiny hypocrite who has very different ideas about who she’s allowed to date/kiss and who everyone else is allowed to date/kiss. It’s simple: she can kiss and flirt with anyone even if they have a girlfriend (or she has a boyfriend); no one else can do the same. 2) Also, the girl is in France and is a huge film fanatic. Yet all she does is watch a bunch of American movies. In France. Because we all know French cinema has nothing at all to offer a film-critic wannabe. 3)	St. Clair is the worst kind of jerk: the kind of jerk who is under the misapprehension that he is actually a nice guy. And everyone else is under that impression as well.4)	The book is written in present tense which doesn't fit this generic YA romance. 5)	The book is boring. I can’t even make myself hate it. In a couple of days, when I get over the time I wasted in reading it, I will probably forget about it altogether.",295,24
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,jessica,"2,475",29600,3,"December 17, 2019","ahhh, paris. the city of lights. la ville d’amour. the perfect setting for any book, in my opinion, and this story only made me fall in love with the city all over again. <3and thats about the only positive experience that came from reading this. whomp whomp. i have seen an overwhelming amount of positive reviews for this and thought i was going to be in for a light-hearted and fluffy YA novel, but i was surprised at how problematic i found this to be. and normally that wouldnt bother me - i do a pretty decent job at separating what i would/wouldnt tolerate in real life from events that happen in fiction, but a lot of the stuff in this book rubbed me the wrong way, to the point of not really enjoying this as much i would have wanted. i dont want to spoil anything, but there are sooo many inexcusable character flaws, its bonkers. but gosh. you guys. did i mention paris? ugh. im drooling over the sights, sounds, smells, colours, and textures of the city. i thought stephanie perkins did a wonderful job at really bringing the city to life and showcasing all that it has to offer. so if it wasnt for the setting, i might not have finished this. its obvious i cared way more about paris than about the characters or plot. and i probably would have rated this lower if i didnt have such a soft spot for the city. le sigh.↠ 2.5 stars",242,26
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Virginia Ronan ♥ Herondale ♥,514,34400,3,"March 3, 2019","”I live here.” I point dumbly at my room while my mind whirrs: French name, English accent, American school. Anna confused.”This quote! *lol* It about sums up at least 90% of all the teens who ever fell in love and were completely dumbstruck by the sudden appearance of their love interest. And I think this wasn’t just a nice scene but also relatable af. XDSo I apparently enjoyed the book, but unlike the majority of my friends I only gave “Anna and the French Kiss” three stars. I’m sure you can’t help but wonder about the rating and secretly ask yourself: “How come?” And here comes the moment when I speak the words I never thought I’d ever say: It’s unpopular opinion time. (Obviously. *lol*) Uh oh. I can already feel the wave of wrath that is crashing down on me, but before you take out your pitchforks, sharpen your scythes and scream “Down with her head!!” let me explain and elaborate first. ;-PThere were a lot of things I liked about “Anna and the French Kiss” but I think it read like one of those teenage love movies you can watch at the cinema. I mean that’s not necessarily a bad thing and I love such movies but they are always kind of run of the mill. Like at first it’s fluffy and nice, then the two MCs hit it off, then something happens that causes them to part, then one of the MCs tries to forget the other and does something stupid, then the shit goes down and the MC reaches a low where it ends up all alone without any friends and then there is suddenly a turning point and everything is good again. Phew! That was a long explanation but I’m sure you get what I’m trying to tell you. ”He smiles. “Oh, I see. Known me less than a day and teasing me about my accent. What’s next? Care to discuss the state of my hair? My height? My trousers?”Whilst it’s true that there are a lot of topics that are different to other books and movies, it’s still undeniable that the overall main plot can be described like that. I mean you can change the nuances but in the end the outcome is the same, right? Still, I don’t mind run of the mill-plots as long as they are done nicely and it mostly was done nicely in “Anna and the French Kiss”. So what is my problem then?! *lol* I’ll be damned if I know, but I think it might have been the combination of all those different topics. The way they appeared and how they were dealt with, or in some cases not dealt with. It was just too much. I mean you could argue that in real life a lot of shitty things happen at the same time as well and you certainly wouldn’t be wrong with that, but it was a whole lot different than I expected. I mean in the first 50% of the book we got the fluff I craved for and after that the book started to frustrate me and just continued to do so until the end. And I feel like I owe you an explanation for that so I’ll just go with the truth. ”Wanna come beat her up for me?”“I’m packing my throwing stars right now.”I loved Anna’s and Étienne’s friendship! Because they were #friendshipgoals but I hated that he had a girlfriend throughout the entire book. I mean I guess we can all agree that this is kind of problematic (understatement of the century) if you want to develop a relationship between two MCs, but what really got me was that I could relate way too much. When I was a teen I was in love with my best friend too and he had a gf as well. (Don’t judge I never acted on my feelings and funnily enough it was 
  HIS
 girlfriend who cheated on him in the end and destroyed their relationship… too personal? Okay let’s move on.) Anyway! What I’m trying to say is that I could understand and feel Anna’s growing frustration! ”Why is it that the right people never wind up together? Why are people so afraid to leave a relationship, even if they know it’s a bad one?”I asked myself that very same question about a thousand times. And I’m 31 now but
   I. still. don’t. get. it!
 I mean if I don’t love my partner anymore I don’t stay with her/him right? I know there are a lot of people who’d beg to differ but I’m a very honest and blunt person and I address my problems with others directly. (Maybe one of the reasons why not everyone can stomach my friendship. *lol*) So I know there might be many reasons to stick with your partner but for me it’s just the question of whether I love her/him still or not. (If you have kids it’s always a little more complicated though…) Still, we’re getting off topic here. I think what I’m trying to convey is that the last 50% of the book were just frustrating for me and that this took out a lot of my enjoyment. What I wanted to read didn’t go along with what I read and even though this made the book very realistic it kind of killed the romance for me. I guess my expectations were just different. I expected to read a fluffy romance and got a ton of frustration instead. *lol* So you might say it’s a typical case of “It’s not the book, it’s me.” and you’d be totally right. Plus I think Anna had a right to be angry at Bridgette! (But that’s another story for another day. XD)”How many times can our emotions be tied to someone else’s – be pulled and stretched and twisted – before they snap? Before they can never be mended again?”Conclusion:My personal experiences apparently ruined the book for me. *lol* I can understand why so many people love it and I wish I could have loved it too, but it just didn’t work out for me. So please, don’t let my rating keep you from reading the book, I’m sure some of you will love and enjoy it still. =) ___________________________________I tried to reduce my TBR with inventing “Hugs’n’kisses OR Dismissed by the Missus/Messrs” and since I chose to hug and read “Anna and the French Kiss” I’ll go through with it now. XDThere are still 6 days left until I’m supposed to be finished with this and I’m sure this is going to be a fast read. *lol* (Romances usually are.) I really hope this will give me all those fluffy feels, because I am ready! ;-)",220,26

This book made me a chronic giddy Nook hugger. What a hot mess! But so what I ♥ it. Jolly good book indeed!Anna and the French Kiss is an absolute hit. It immediately takes top rank in my fave YA romance, chicky-type lit reads and there is absolutely no doubt I’ll be reading this book every year over and over again. The blokes and blokettes are loveable, the storyline is perfect, and the light romance is a thing of shear beauty. I could go on an on about how much this book made me feel light hearted and happy… just plain ole happy, but you’re just going to have to experience it for yourself. In this book, Anna is shipped off to SOAP, School of America in Paris by her Nicholas Sparky-type author dad; and she’s absoltuely homesick, lost and insecure as she doesn’t speak a lick of French. Along comes the best crew of characters and not only befriend Anna, but drag her out of her dorm to experience the city of Paris and all of its wonders. As the book progresses, Anna and St. Clair develop a lovey type friendship that they eventually must acknowledge, but not without some messy sitches along the way. My favorite scenes in the book: Anna and St. Clair’s tour of the city, their Turkey dinner in Paris, yelling down the halls and stairwell during the holiday, sleepovers, multiple trips to the cinema, the flight home, the emails back and forth, the New Year’s telephone call, Whyareyougivingawaythecookies?, the banana bead, Pablo Neruda poetry book... I love Neruda! Gah! I could go on and on, so let’s just say I loved it all.St. Clair is absolute perfection, yummier than a fluffy croissant. Anna is adorably awesome and flawed, the type of girl that you’d love to pinch her cheeks and run like hell. Together, their story is full of enjoyable moments that reminded me how sporadically awesome it was to be a teenager. Loved it!!! ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ Do I recommend it?? Ummm bloody hell yeah!Thanks to the Street Corner Bookers for finding this book and adding it to our read and rant! After a string of no hits, we’ve found our stride.

6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Miranda,512,117,1,"June 24, 2011","I’m going to be right up front and honest: I really, really, really did not like this book. 	Before I get into why I’m going to start off with the parts I did like. This won’t take long because there aren’t many. Perkins is definitely a talented writer as far as the technical stuff goes. Her prose flows nicely, Anna has a distinct voice (the only distinct voice in the novel, sadly), and not once did her writing feel strained or forced. She’s actually good, which is why my intense dislike of this book is disappointing. There was also a scene in the novel between Anna and her little brother Seany that made me smile because it was sweet and touching and realistic, and a few jokes here and there that made me laugh. But otherwise a lot of my feelings towards Anna and the French Kiss consist of intense dislike... okay I’ll be honest, more like actual hate. There were several times when I honestly had to put the book down and walk away for a while because I was getting so angry.	I don’t generally have a problem with books or movies that concern themselves solely with how the main characters get together. I find that the key to getting me interested in giving me good characters who work wonderfully together and level each other out. But I have to actually like the characters and their type of relationship if I’m going to spend a few hours reading their journey together.		I did not like Anna and St. Clair’s relationship, and you can pretty much blame St. Clair for that.	St. Clair, or Étienne, is pretty much a jerk. He’s not intended to come across that way--in fact he’s written to be the most perfect boyfriend a girl or guy could ever ask for. For most of the novel he comes across as too perfect, actually. Until we get to the reason why he and Anna can’t get together for most of the novel: He won’t break up with his current girlfriend, Ellie. Even though it’s extremely obvious to everyone, probably even Ellie herself, that he’s no longer in love with her, he won’t call it off. He would rather be miserable with her than initiate a change in his life, since it’s stated in the book that he’s afraid of change. 	I’m sorry but that’s the worst thing to do to a person. It’s disrespectful, to put it quite frankly, and it’s wrong to treat a person you supposedly loved at some point like that. For much of the book, while Anna was hating on Ellie (which I’ll get to in a moment, oh will I ever), I just kept thinking “Just wait, Anna. If he’s doing this to Ellie, he’ll do it to you one day.” As one would expect, that kind of put a huge damper on the whole romantic storyline. The plot line with Ellie just felt like a very weak, very convenient way to keep Étienne and Anna from getting together too fast. 	So given my intense dislike for Étienne, the book was already kind of doomed for me. After all, I have to like the other half of the couple if I’m going to be invested in a romance novel.	But I could handle disliking Étienne if the rest of the book could make up for his jerkitude. Unfortunately there was more that irritated me than just Étienne.	The secondary characters were pretty much just that. They came in and said stuff when the plot needed it (this is especially apparent in Meredith’s case) and then left so the book could focus on Anna and Étienne again. In the case of Meredith, Anna’s first new friend when she arrives in Paris, she’s in love with Étienne as well. I was hopeful that Meredith and Anna could settle things peacefully, or Meredith would admit her feelings to Étienne and then back off to let him decide who he wanted to be with. But no, of course Meredith takes it out on Anna instead of being cross with Étienne that he never discouraged her or made it plain that he wasn’t interested in being anything other than friends. Every time Anna and Étienne are remotely romantic with each other in front of their group of friends, Meredith gets jealous and pouty. These are pretty much the only times she’s present so it stands out. 	Then of course there’s Ellie, who meets Anna once and seems to like her okay. But then when Étienne is asking for Anna when he’s drunk, Ellie gets jealous and hateful towards Anna. Of course. Because we can’t have just one girl being all possessive and jealous to another girl over a guy; no, we have to have two! At one point Anna actually imagines causing Ellie bodily harm, when she should be angry with Étienne for stringing Ellie and her along for close to a year. Then there’s the stereotypical “slutty,” “bitchy,” rich popular girl Amanda who dislikes Anna on sight because Étienne is paying more attention to Anna than her. I don’t think it’s a mere coincidence, either, that “slutty” is used often in conjunction with Ellie and Amanda. Ellie dresses up as a slutty nurse for Halloween, Amanda is mentioned to have revealing clothing on most of the time. Anna, it’s mentioned, is still a virgin. I don’t think I’m wrong in believing the comparisons were deliberate there.	I’m sorry but can we put these tropes/cliches to bed, already? I am tired of seeing girls fighting each other for a guy, especially a jerk like Étienne. It reinforces so, so many unpleasant stereotypes about women, and it teaches us that we should fight instead of supporting each other, while the guy gets away with bad behaviour, and I’m just sick of it. Yes, eventually Anna does stand up for Meredith against Amanda, but by that point it was too little, too late. 	I wish I could have liked Anna and the French Kiss more than I did. I suppose it’s a good thing it made me feel something, even if that something was intense hatred for all the cliches and offensive stereotypes the novel used. Despite the fact that I was not impressed with this novel, I’d be interested in seeing what else Perkins has to offer due to her talented writing. I can only hope she creates better, more sympathetic characters for her next novel, and doesn’t reinforce so many unpleasant stereotypes about women and romance.",187,24
6936382,Anna and the French Kiss,Kiki,188,8447,5,"January 13, 2016","What I like about Stephanie Perkins is that her books are fluffy, and they're okay with that: there's no heavy message attached to this as the author attempts to shove an after-school special down our throats. I didn't like that when I was a teenager, and I don't like it now. Sometimes I feel like that's my real problem with contemporary novels - that they want desperately to be didactic in the way that dystopia or high fantasy is but their settings are too literal to pull it off properly. But Stephanie Perkins is cool, subtle; she holds back, relaxes, and lets the story speak for itself. She trusts her readers. I like that.Anna and the French Kiss was a strange read for me in that I'm not a contemporary fan and nor am I overly enamoured of romance, mostly because I find 85% of it to be terribly unconvincing. I'm not an overly romantic person at heart thus your story of this average straight couple who meet in the rain and face menial trials because ~one of them doesn't believe in love~ won't tickle my fancy. I expect a little more.I expect what Stephanie Perkins gave us: a beautiful setting, atypical characters, smooth writing and a satisfying final payoff. We see Etienne and Anna get together because that's what we've been waiting for, and Perkins made us wait for it. She knew we'd love this couple, because she knew the story she was telling had enough meat to make us care. Anna is a rich kid, but she wasn't always; she's rash and sometimes selfish, but she's a girl in love for the first time. Oftentimes I worry that adult readers who are harshly judging female leads forget that these female leads are teenagers, and when we were teenagers, we all felt like a zit or a laughing-peeing incident was the end of the world. It wasn't, but being a teenager is hard; being in that transitional phase puts enormous pressure on us as human beings. Perkins captures this well. I remember being thrilled when I was sixteen and realizing that yes, writing was something people did, and something I could do - it wasn't that I'd had success, but simply having something be certain in the waffling, uncomfortable abyss of adolescence. It was relief to me to find that I could braid my hair and wear makeup and have it look good, after struggling so hard with uncertain feelings about whether my friends really liked me or how good my grades were, whether people noticed the holes in my clothes that I couldn't afford to replace, how I fit in my broken family, how I'd ever have enough money to strike out on my own, what my face looked like, what my puberty-ravaged body looked like, my sexuality, my plans for the future, where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. Perkins grabs hold of teenage waffling and pulls the covers off it, and she makes it romantic, yet finite. Things sometimes suck, she says, but they do get better.I've seen a few heads shaking at the cheating aspect of this book, and I'd like to share with you a very unpopular opinion: cheating happens for a reason. Sometimes the reason is that the fuckwad you're dating is too cowardly to admit that they're not ready for commitment. Sometimes it's because the existing couple is incompatible, thus one or both of them looks elsewhere. Sometimes it's because you have to break a few eggs to make an omelette. Cheating isn't okay; it's not justifiable. But cheating, like Cheez-whiz and Nickleback, has its unsavoury reasoning. This book, like a good series opener should, saw me clamouring to get my hands on its sequels. And I did get my hands on them; I've read them both. This is the essence of Perkins' readable, deft writing: it's moreish and addictive, easy but not simplistic. There's skill there, and it encompasses a wide audience, from teens to nostalgic adults. I, an adult*, wasn't ashamed to be seen reading this book on the terrace. (That might, though, be in part due to the beautiful and subtle covers of the UK paperbacks. That is how you create a book cover, art teams! Subtly!)What else can I say? Stephanie Perkins rocks, and so does her writing, and her colourful cast of characters. Five stars well deserved.*My labelling myself an 'adult' is based on age only. I am a strange vapour of a human being with a low D- in adulting. I'm really good at public transport and packing my shit into boxes but sometimes I forget how to make phone calls.",185,26
