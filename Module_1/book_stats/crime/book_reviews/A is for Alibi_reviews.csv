64863,A is for Alibi,Kelly (and the Book Boar),"2,393",7247,1,"January 2, 2018","Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Two reviews in the same morning? I guess it’s your lucky day (ha-ha - NOT). And just look at that bright and shiny 1 Star rating. That should be a sure fire way to earn me some new friends. If you’re not interested in reading through my reasons behind not liking this book, here’s the Cliff’s Notes version of my reaction upon finishing . . . 
  
So the long story of how I began my relationship with Kinsey Millhone at this late date is as follows: In general I am not a fan of books in a series. Added on to that fact, I already sold my soul broke my own rule for Janet Evanovich and her eleventy billion Plum stories. Friends were constantly telling me if I liked Stephanie Plum, I was sure to simply looooove Kinsey (basically because Kinsey supposedly had her shit together and wouldn’t get kidnapped every 42 seconds). I kept fighting the good fight and said I wouldn’t begin reading these books until I found “A” in hardback for wicked cheap. Well, I found A-F for a buck each.My rating started out at a solid 3 Stars (which is about as good as it gets from me when it comes to a light mystery like this). The premise was familiar, but still A-Okay in my book: Nikki is a recently-released-from-prison convicted murderer who shows up seeking Kinsey’s help in order to find the true killer of her philandering husband. Kinsey takes the case and starts tracking down the various ex-Mrs. Fife’s in order to piece part the crime together. It was all very . . . 
  
and I was digging it.
  “He was like some old tomcat, always sniffin’ around the same back porch.”
By the halfway point, though, I was really starting to struggle. There was just SO. MUCH. FILLER. This book could have easily been cut in half. Here are some examples (nickel’s worth of free advice – drink a 5 Hour Energy before reading these quotes):
  “The interior was done with polished uneven red-tile flooring, mirrors floor to ceiling, and panels of raw gray wood, hung here and there with clusters of dried corn.”

   “The roof was nearly flat, peppered with rocks, the iron railings sending streaks of rust down the sides of the building. The landscaping was rock and yucca and cactus plants.” 

  
Oh, and I can’t forget all of the jogging:
   “I jogged south on Wilshire, just for variety, cutting across to San Vicente at Twenty-sixth Street.” 

  
And if Kinsey is supposed to have her shit together, then why is she the dumbest bitch EVER?!?!?! I mean, do y’all remember what happens in this book???? 
  
I had been sitting at 2 Stars, but that ending? HELL NAH! 1 Star it is. I mean, I thought I had the whodunit it figured out right away, but I kept trying to convince myself I was wrong. I just had to be wrong. Sadly I wasn’t. As for the rest of this series? Well, it can . . . 
  
Men authors get grief all the time for not writing quality women characters. Ms. Grafton should be forced to wear the cone of shame for eternity for writing someone as stupid as Kinsey. Give me back my Plum novels. At least she knows she’s an idiot. Throw in some Hiassen for more guffaws, some Leonard in order to obtain some cool points, and some Lehane when I need some grit and I think I can easily live without ever taking another gander at Kinsey Millhone.",130,53
64863,A is for Alibi,Jen,209,117,1,"December 12, 2007","Kinsey Millhone is a single female working as a private investigator in Santa Theresa, California. She is hired by Nikki Fife, the convicted murdered of Lawrence Fife (her husband), to find out who really killed him. Her investigation leads her into a series of other murders that seem to be connected.I don't know if I can even justify one star on this book. I was at no point able to ""connect"" with Kinsey. I love a strong female character, but she does not fit that bill. She is crass which makes her seem uneducated and low-class. Attempts at presenting emotion from her were not believable; she simply came across as apathetic the entire novel. And how she could solve any crime with the amount of alcohol she consumed in this book is beyond me. Aside from the lack of dimension in her character, I am also not a fan of Grafton's writing style. This is the first book I've read of hers and from the get go, I was not impressed. At first I thought maybe I would try reading a couple of her books before I made a decision, but I don't think I could make it through another book of this caliber. The book was completely predictable. The outcome was obvious before you even hit the midpoint. Grafton tends to include pointless detail that does nothing to further the plot. And there are so many problems with the logic throughout the novel. For example, she says that Kinsey wipes down her Las Vegas hotel room to get rid of prints. Yet she paid her bill, SIGNED the bill and both owners of the hotel saw and talked to her. If she's trying to get rid of her presence in the hotel, she left an awfully bright trail...afterall, if someone were trying to establish she was there, wouldn't fingerprinting be further down the road from eyewitness accounts and paper records?This was definitely a let-down, and I will not be pursuing any further letters of the alphabet. There are far more interesting books out there to fill my time. ",96,20
64863,A is for Alibi,Francesc,382,190,2,"April 29, 2022","Lo leí con ganas de descubrir a una autora con mucho renombre y me quedé un poco desilusionado.No fue una lectura muy convincente.Creo que, personalmente, leo pocas novelas de escritoras. No es por nada. Tal vez me dejo llevar por la inercia y no caen en mis manos.Debo mejorar.I read it with the desire to discover a renowned author and I was a little disappointed. It wasn't a very convincing read. I think I personally read few novels by women writers. It's not for nothing. Perhaps I get carried away by inertia and do not fall into my hands. I must improve.",65,5
64863,A is for Alibi,Jilly,"1,838",6209,3,"February 28, 2019","Wait, should I shelved this in ""Historical Fiction""? So, yeah, you can call me a trend-setter. I'm up on the hip scene of today. I know what is cool... or as you kids might say, I'm DTF. (That means Definitely Trendy and Fresh, right?)Oh, I'm sure you are wrong Inigo Montoya. I'm very fleek and shit.Alright, so I've had this book since childhood and decided now was the perfect time to read it. Yes, my TBR pile is slightly unruly....I was okay with the idea that this was written in the 1980's, so I expected all of the lack of civilization that I have no idea how we lived without. I mean, people drove around in cars without texting and walked through the grocery store without talking on the phone. How did they kill time while waiting for a restaurant table or a doctor's appointment? Did they actually touch those nasty old magazines at the doctor's office with the germs of a billion sick people writhing like a primordial bacteria soup just waiting for the next victim? And, there wasn't even Purell back then. It's like we lived like filthy animals or something. They used payphones! payphones!Yeah, so that's the world this is set in. Just think: no technology, lots of germs, and giant hairdos held up with cans and cans of ozone-killing hairspray.A timely reminder... Holy crap, is that guy's gold medallion necklace tangled in his chest hair? *gagging* Didn't they have Crest White Strips yet?Where's my Purell? Okay. So, Kinsey is a private investigator who is looking into an old murder after the person who was wrongfully convicted gets out of prison. This story is completely procedural as she goes through her steps of solving the crime. Did I solve it before her? Yes. Of course I did. But, there was one little detail that surprised me, so that was fun.  I didn't expect two different killers.And, despite this reading a little bit like an old Murder She Wrote episode, I liked Kinsey. She was very human and easy to understand. She wasn't a special snowflake. She wasn't so beautiful that every guy wanted her. She wasn't even the smartest person in the room most of the time. But, I found her likable because of all of that.As for the writing style - well, it got a bit wordy in the descriptions. A lot of skimming is necessary when reading about the characteristics of a rooftop or which streets she passed while jogging. And, there's a lot of jogging in this book. I mean, we actually go with her on her jogs. I didn't quite get why we couldn't have just read the words, ""after her jog...."" instead of reading about where she jogged, how long she jogged, and her after-jog shower. But, hey, maybe the author wanted to inspire us to get off our fat asses, put down the book, and run for no reason. Whatever. I read it with no guilt while eating cookie dough straight from the package like a banana.You aren't the boss of me!I'm going to keep reading this series, because, what the hell... reasons....But, I'm also curious if the books will morph through the years as the series was written to reflect the changes in the real world as they happened, or if it will stay set in the 1980's.

64863,A is for Alibi,Phrynne,"3,111",1975,4,"September 13, 2016","It's interesting that Kinsey Millhone and Vic Warshawski both appeared for the first time in the same year. I wonder why the market suddenly felt the need for two female P.I.s. It was a very good thing anyway!!! Vic has been a favourite of mine for some time now but this is the first time I have tried this series by Sue Grafton and I did enjoy it. Kinsey's approach to detecting was reasonably realistic, I liked the old style feel to everything(was the 1980's really that long ago!) and the writing was good. The story built up quite slowly but picked up the pace at the end and it was easy to read the whole thing in a fairly short time.I will certainly move on to the next book and it is very likely that I will make my way through the whole series:)",55,11
64863,A is for Alibi,Matthew,31,12,3,"September 19, 2009","I read this book as part of an interdisciplinary course in law school entitled ""Law in Literature."" While the book was acceptable/average in terms of its overall plot, development, and color, my enjoyment of the novel came from the fact that until the last half of the book (when the protagonist - a female detective - sleeps with a man she is investigating) I hadn't realized that the main character was a woman. I thought of myself as suitably progressive when the novel described the main character wanting to date a guy, and putting on pantyhose. ""Wow?! A gay, cross-dressing detective? That's unique!"" Nope. Novel is totally about a woman instead. Don't know how I managed to make it halfway through the book before that lightbulb clicked on, but the absolutely hilarious part is that most of the men in the class apparently hadn't figured it out until the middle of the book either.",47,11
64863,A is for Alibi,Baba,"3,503",725,3,"December 19, 2020","Kinsey Millhone case No. 1:So it took me nearly a year to get a hold of the first book in this series; but I finally got to read it. Kinsey's debut book/case after opening her private investigator agency. It starts off with bang, with Kinsey fatally shooting someone! The book then goes back in time detailing the events that led to the shooting. Interesting debut for this character, and no doubt a refreshing take of the detective genre when first published. 6 out of 12.",37,N/A
64863,A is for Alibi,Crystal Starr Light,"1,335",810,2,"October 18, 2022","Disclaimer: I have been reading and reviewing for over a decade, and in that time, I have grown and changed a lot. My views in the following review reflect the person I was when I wrote them and may not reflect who I am today - for better or for worse. While I would love to be able to reread and update my reviews to reflect who I am today, I think my time is better dedicated elsewhere. If you choose to read this review, please bear in mind this attitude.A is for Aggravating, Anguish, Awful, Apathetic...take your pickI had heard the name Sue Grafton bantered around. After my aunt recommended it, I decided to check out her infamous alphabet series.Kinsey Millhone is a former cop, a twice divorcee, and a private investigator. Nikki Fife, a woman accused, convicted, and imprisoned for murdering her philandering husband, Laurence Fife, has just been released on parole and wants her name cleared. She comes to Kinsey, who takes the case and begins the slow process of unraveling the truth hidden by eight years.Good:No one can say that Sue Grafton skips over the description. She details the surroundings, the people, Kinsey's thoughts, and more very much so that the setting and circumstances are real.Kinsey is a unique protagonist, and the first person point of view is perfect for her. We get an intimate look into her mind as she interviews the suspects and slowly unravels the mystery. Also, I enjoyed seeing Kinsey doing more than one investigation. All too often, in books, movies, and TV, we see investigators focusing solely on one mystery at a time. This book portrays it in a more realistic fashion.Lastly, the final few chapters rush together into intense, edge-of-your-seat action. And the ending is a surprise--sort of.Bad:First off, Kinsey Millhone comes off as less a person and more a vehicle for telling the story. Her personal feelings appear so infrequently that I began to feel that she was truly emotionless. The narrative is delivered in a matter-of-fact manner, which is nice, but please, show some emotion! Give an opinion! Quit hiding behind descriptions! Furthermore, Kinsey frequently acts very masculine. I had to remind myself on numerous occasions that she was a woman. And since the author is obviously a woman, this is rather sad (I have read better female perspectives from men!). Add to that how often the woman drinks (three glasses of wine at least in one day--see pages 227, 244, 248!), and I wonder how she's not an alcoholic.Other characters are poor. Arlette is treated like a stupid fat person. Nikki is as unemotional and unreachable as Kinsey. Charlotte is a drunk. Gwen is a little better but not much. Charlie drove me up the wall, and the others are just too minor.Another bothersome aspect is that the story really doesn't kick in until 130 pages into the book. The first 130 pages detail lots of backstory, interviewing everyone and his/her mother, and pretty much anything that had nothing to do with the mystery. All this could have easily taken half that time. In the about 200 pages, Kinsey has jogged/run at least 4 times, slept about as many times, has drunk many times that many glasses of alcohol (as I mentioned previously), has flirted three times with Charlie, has called Charlie at least that many, has driven all over southern California and Nevada, has gotten sick in Las Vegas, has checked into three motels, and has stumbled upon a murder. Yes, she has interviewed almost a dozen people, but has she really learned anything in that time? Not much, really.As if this wasn't bad enough, the mystery is really not all that spectacular. It had the potential of being interesting, but Grafton failed to take the opportunity to bring it to the next level (mostly because she writes it so that Kinsey doesn't really do anything until the last 20 pages). Most of Kinsey's investigating involves convenient guessing. Kinsey doesn't really surface any evidence, nor does she glean anything really important from all her interviews. She just happens to make very good guesses.Lastly, Kinsey's relationship with Charlie was strange in a first book in a series. I mean, it is so completely obvious from the first introduction (how ""sexual"" Charlie was) that Grafton planned on throwing these two together. Grafton does a poor job of giving the couple chemistry, other than a few obligatory sex scenes. If Kinsey is supposed to be such a professional, why does she completely forget conflict of interests and sleep with a suspect? And why does it take her almost 250+ pages to figure this out?(UPDATE from 2022: I now realize, this is a very typical mystery/PI trope.)Overall:The first few chapters were pretty good. But I could never quite get into the book. I really couldn't associate with Kinsey, the mystery was ho-hum (straight out of an 80's TV series), and the other characters were unremarkable. If I ever do read anymore of these books, I will definitely read more reviews to get a better idea of what I am in store for. And I will definitely take my aunt's recommendation with a grain of salt.",33,6
64863,A is for Alibi,Darlene,370,130,4,"July 5, 2019","I began reading the 'alphabet 'series written by Sue Grafton when the first book, 'A is for Alibi' featuring private detective Kinsey Millhone, was published in 1982. Over the years, I continued to read each new offering in the series, with the exception of the last book written, 'Y is for Yesterday'. At the time of Sue Grafton's death in December 2017, I had not yet read this book. I decided that since so much time has gone by since the series started.. 37 years... that I would make a kind of project out of rereading the series. I decided to start at the beginning but this time, I would listen to the audiobook of each novel. I'm curious to discover how these novels have held up to the passage of time. Will they feel dated and unreliable? Or will I love them as much as the first time I read them?Upon finishing 'A is for Alibi', narrated on audiobook by Mary Peiffer, I'm happy to say that I enjoyed this first book in the series as much as when I read it in 1982. Certainly, as you might expect, a story set in 1982 which was years before the explosion of the technological advances we now enjoy DOES feel dated in some ways. There are no cell phones in this story; instead, Kinsey Millhone is always on the hunt for a public pay phone. Since the internet hadn't been created, Kinsey must conduct her research and background checks on individuals at the public library where she frequently uses microfiche or through public records available at the county courthouse. And of course, instead of organizing the data she collects on a computer, she assembles a collection of 3"" x 5"" index cards on a bulletin board and she produces her finished case reports for clients on her Smith Corona typewriter. Oddly enough, I didn't find any of these aspects of the story annoying. Perhaps it's because I didn't grow up with the current available technologies. Regardless, the absence of cell phones and computers didn't lessen my enjoyment of this novel. In fact, this absence of technology leant a sort of classic detective noir feeling to the novel.The book is narrated by Kinsey Millhone herself and opens with a perfect intrpoduction of who she is.... ""My name is Kinsey Millhone. I'm a private investigator, licensed by the state of California... I'm thirty-two years old, twice divorced, no kids... I'm a nice person and I have a lot of friends. My apartment is small but I like living in a cramped space. I've lived in trailers most of my life, but lately they've been getting too elaborate for my taste so now I live in one room, a  'bachelorette'. I don't have pets. I don't have houseplants. I spend a lot of time on the road and I don't like leaving things behind. Aside from the hazards of my profession, my life has always been ordinary, uneventful and good...... ""In this, Kinsey Millhone's first case, she is visited at her office by a woman named Nikki Fife who has just been paroled after serving an 8-year prison sentence for the murder of her divorce attorney-husband Laurence Fife. Nikki insists that she is innocent and she wants to hire Kinsey to reinvestigate the murder. Although Kinsey is skeptical, she admits to herself that it makes no sense for a guilty woman who has just been released from prison to want to dredge up old controversies and scandals. So she agrees that she will see what she can find but makes no promises.Kinsey begins her reinvestigation into Laurence Fife's murder with a visit to the Santa Teresa Police Department where she asked Lieutenant Con Dolan for a look at the Fife case files. Because Nikki had been convicted by a jury who purportedly weighed the evidence presented by both the prosecuting and defense attorneys, she wasn't expecting to discover any new evidence. But she was startled to find that just 4 days after Laurence Fife died after ingesting allergy medication laced with oleander, a young woman named Libby Glass, who had been an accountant in Fife's law firm, had also died from oleander poisoning. The police had been aware of Libby Glass's death but hadn't been able to connect her death to Nikki Fife. Con Dolan was certain that Nikki had also murdered Libby Glass but Kinsey wasn't so sure. Kinsey believed Nikki had been telling her the truth and she was determined to follow the new clues to get to the bottom of the mystery of just who murdered Laurence Fife and Libby Glass.. and why. Kinsey started her investigation the old fashioned way... using plenty of 'shoe leather' and interviewing all of the people in Laurence Fife and Libby Glass's life at the time of their murders. Her potential suspect list was long. She interviewed and reinterviewed Laurence's ex-wife Gwen and their two grown children, Greg and Diane; Laurence's former business partner and colleague, Charlie Scorsoni; Laurence's former secretary, Sharon Rapier and of course, she also tracked down and interviewed Libby Glass's family and colleagues, including her emotionally devastated parents and her rude and bad-tempered ex-boyfriend Lyle. These interviews keep Kinsey on the road, traveling from Santa Teresa to Los Angeles and finally to Las Vegas and with each of these interviews, she began to form a mental picture of what had been happening in the victims' lives right before the murder. Kinsey realized she was getting closer to the murderer and who one of her interviewees is murdered, Kinsey also realizes that the murderer is getting closer to HER and her life is in danger. Can she wrap up this case before it's too late?I was happy and a little surprised at how much I enjoyed rereading 'A is for Alibi' after so many years. Although the plot was vaguely familiar to me, I had no memory of how the case was ultimately resolved. And despite the fact that Kinsey drives around in her '68 VW 'Bug' and has terrible dietary habits (or maybe BECAUSE of those things), I find that I still really like her character. I enjoy her independence and the fact that although she's tough on the outside, she isn't all that tough on the inside and can empathize with her clients, regardless of how unsavory some of them may seem. I look forward to making my way through the 'alphabet' series once again.",31,16
64863,A is for Alibi,Sandy *The world could end while I was reading and I would never notice*,"1,896",1995,4,"May 12, 2018","EXCERPT: My name is Kinsey Millhone. I 'm a private investigator, licensed by the state of California. I'm thirty-two years old, twice divorced, no kids. The day before yesterday I killed someone, and the fact weighs heavily on my mind. ABOUT THIS BOOK: A IS FOR AVENGERA tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she's got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.A IS FOR ACCUSEDThat's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.A IS FOR ALIBI If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.MY THOUGHTS: Is there anyone out there who has never read one of Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone books? I have, at some point, read most of the earlier ones in the series. This, the very first, is, I still believe, one of the best of the series. I plan on working my way through the full series eventually. They are not particularly gripping, or shocking. But they are good in a comfortable way. You don't have to concentrate, or go back and replay bits. It is what it is. I am going to miss Sue Grafton. Like a comfortable pair of slippers. I listened to the audiobook of A Is For Alibi by Sue Grafton, narrated by Mary Peiffer and published by Books on Tape via OverDrive.

64863,A is for Alibi,Erin *Proud Book Hoarder*,"2,376",1050,4,"February 16, 2017"," “My own mystery, unplumed, undetected, was sorted into files that were neatly labeled but really didn't say much.” Kinsey Millhone, an average detective with a conscience and a relaxed lifestyle, lands a whopper of a case to open this first of many, many books. Her client's wishes? To find out who really killed her husband AFTER she's released from prison for doing the deed.Mildly paced with other mediocre tension, the book mainly wins through the point of view of the detective. She's a down-to-earth, relatable protagonist. Divorced and eager to help solve crimes for the underdog, even if she doesn't go to those cases intentionally, her thorough skills show a mystery where the clues are solved by actual logical work and not just nifty clue falling into her lap like most mysteries do. We get to go through random phone calls, ponderings of a next step, legwork, and misleading interviews. Good old detective classics.While Kinsey is likable, she's not a detective I fell in love with. You could enter any other detective and get this technique and outcome. The writing style puts in enjoyable humor in serious situations, but it's mainly kept to the point and focused on the story at hand. The ending wasn't a surprise because it had been bouncing in the back of my head as a possibility, but it still dealt an ending that was the shine of the story. I won't be forgetting the twist of who it was and how no one is safe from being the big bad villain.I'd have liked to have a follow-up and longer ending that shows the after-effects, especially Nikki learning what really went down that fateful night years ago, but oh well. A good mystery for those who did modern golden-age detectives.",24,3
64863,A is for Alibi,Louie the Mustache Matos,880,59,4,"August 23, 2022","I have collected and read Sue Grafton novels for several years, but I read them out of order as I acquired them. This year, I intend to read them in order. A is for Alibi is the first of the Kinsey Millhone novels. Kinsey is a tough, twice-divorced, former cop with her own detective agency situated adjacent to an insurance company in Santa Teresa, California. In this first installment, we get acquainted with some of the characters in Kinsey’s orbit. Here, the story revolves around a convicted female felon that hires Kinsey to find out who actually murdered her husband. Of course, the murder happened five years ago and trying to dredge up history is never easy, but if it were easy everyone would want to do it. Extremely cool, with a dash of noir, and a healthy dose of estrogen. I will always be grateful for my sister, Dee, who introduced me to Grafton and Millhone, and for other more important reasons as well.",24,2

It's dated of course, set and written in the 1980s, at the forefront of PI novels with ballsy female protagonists. I loved that no one had mobiles, but relied on a call service, and that case files were handwritten or typed. The case was a good one. I'm looking forward to continuing with this series.
