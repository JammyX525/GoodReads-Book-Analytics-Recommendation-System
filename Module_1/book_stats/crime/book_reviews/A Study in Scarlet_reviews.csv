102868,A Study in Scarlet,Tatiana,"1,379",11700,2,"February 22, 2019","Arthur Conan Doyle's first Sherlock Holmes novel is utterly unimpressive. In short, the book starts like this:and mid-way turns into this:And I am not even joking. The novel begins with Holmes and Watson meeting, moving into their Baker Street apartment and then investigating a murder of a man found in an abandoned house. At the half point, however, the story completely changes its course and becomes the most awkward introduction of the murderer's back story and motives involving Mormons, polygamy, violence, money, and Brigham Young. The structure of The Study in Scarlet is utterly bizarre.But let's not linger on the bad. I want to use this review to shamelessly hype the new BBC version of Sherlock Holmes.This is an absolutely delightful modernized take on the old characters and it offers a much better version of Arthur Conan Doyle's dreadful story. So, check it out.",504,105
102868,A Study in Scarlet,Stephen,"1,517",10800,4,"January 22, 2012","The birth of a legend.... 
  
This is it...the novel in which Sir Arthur ushered the world’s greatest second best detective (after Batman) into our collective consciousness. Being the non-conformist rebel that I am, I started off bassackwards by reading The Valley of Fear and then The Adventure of the Final Problem because those were the two stories with Moriarty in them. Shocking, I know, but that’s just how I roll. Btw, it still really chaffs my cheeks that Doyle wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels about Holmes and the arch-enemy appears in exactly TWO. I know less is sometimes more but, come on Doyle, that is on the scrimpy side of weak. Anyway, I have now circled back and returned to the genesis of the Sherlockian mythos and begun with the tale that started it all. Now, for those that have never read any of the Holmes mysteries, I have come to believe that your level of enjoyment of these stories will be directly proportional to your feelings toward Sherlock Holmes himself. Sir Arthur’s a fine writer and his prose is concise and polished with enough flair to make reading him very enjoyable. In addition, his plotting and pacing are excellent and I think mystery fans will appreciate both the content and structure of the central investigation and the procedural components of clue-gathering and interpretation. These things all point towards a pleasurable experience, However, in the end, the most important barometer in gauging your level of happy will be your reaction to Holmes himself. Thus, I thought I would focus most of my review’s attention on his character bio after briefly summing up the plot as follows: PLOT SUMMARY:Holmes and Watson meet....murder is committed...Holmes investigates....clues are found...Holmes figures it out....a murderer is caught...long flashback to America where Doyle does a Krakauer-style expose on Mormons describing and their child-stealing, polygamous ways...jump forward to present.... all is made clear..... Watson slobbers all over Holmes....... A STUDY IN CHARACTER:Now, let’s take a look at Sherlock’s profile. Whether you are a hater or a homey when it comes to Holmes, I think most people would agree with the following attributes: ** The man is unlikeable...very unlikeable...extremely unlikeable. ** He is self-absorbed to the point of being sociopathic.** His has zero empathy for the victims of the crimes he investigates. ** He is so egotistical that it actually makes his general unlikeability pale in comparison** While never explicitly diagnosed, he is a severe manic-depressive ** He is inconsiderate, callous, cold and socially inept. From a personality standpoint, one of my buddies here on GR said it best...Holmes is “a dick.”Despite that, I find myself very much in the “homey” camp and think he’s among the more fascinating creations in the annals of literature. Part of that appeal is precisely because he is such a prickish turd in the social skill department. However it his mental faculties, the trait he is best known for, that makes him so intriguing. Yes, he is brilliant. However, that is not the end of the story Paul Harvey because it is a unique and very specialized kind of brilliance. Holmes knows the details, and I mean details, of every major crime to have been perpetrated in Europe (and possibly beyond) over the last 500 years. He can also distinguish between every variety of dirt or soil in London and and can tell you the precise brand of tobacco/pipe/cigar simply by its ash. However, as is divulged in this story, Holmes also has no idea that the Earth travels around the sun.  Further, “of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.” How can a man of such singular ability be so woefully lacking in common knowledge. Holmes explains to Watson thusly:
  I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.
 This just struck me as particularly awesome from a story perspective. Not only does such a philosophy provide a cloak of believability to Sherlock’s preternatural detecting skills, but his glaring knowledge deficiencies make him that much more fascinating as a character. I guess I just find Doyle’s profile of Holmes to be superb. He is like a “not quite human” storm of deduction. He’s dispassionate, callous and unimaginably effective. Additionally, he solves crimes not because of a perceived duty, but merely because it is the only thing that keeps the boredom of life away. That and the giant stroking his ego gets when he does “the big explain” which is always entertaining and makes each story worth reading all by itself. Finally, I also see Holmes as a tragic figure. He is a sad, lonely and devoid of any lasting sense of contentment or pleasure. While alive and invigorated when the game is afoot, most of his time is spent as a mere husk of a man with no feeling of day-to-day happiness. All of this makes Holmes an extraordinarily compelling figure to me and one I hope to spend a lot more time reading about. While I did not enjoy this as much as The Adventure of the Final Problem (my favorite so far), I was still glued to the page watching Holmes maneuver through his scenes and really enjoyed the flashback portion set in America. I look forward to many more of his adventures.  4.0 stars. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",362,56
102868,A Study in Scarlet,Anne,"3,785",6900,5,"December 9, 2021","Sherlock Holmes and the case of the Killer Mormons!But more about that later...Ok, the big deal about this one is that you get to see the Sherlock/Watson meet-cute. I mean, this is one of the most important meetings in the history of all literature! Come on, people! Get excited!It's only fair to mention that I've read and reread all of these stories a bjillion times, and these are by far my favorite classic characters.Well, except for Lizzie & Mr. Darcy...But I know I haven't read P&P as many times as I have Sherlock's mysteries, which should tell you something right there.I LOVE YOU, SHERLOCK!And, just to be clear, I loved him before he was all sexified. Ok, so Watson is back from the war (he basically just got trounced on and then came home), and has wasted all of his money is running low on funds. Luckily, he runs into an old pal from school, who just happens to know of this guy who's looking for a roommate. One thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, Felix & Oscar have found their forever home!Alright, as far as the mystery goes, it's just Sherlock running around sniffing things, (implausibly) being able to identify cigar ash, and tracing the movement of criminals using day-old (tromped on) footprints.Given what we know about forensic evidence now, is any of this, in any small way, even remotely believable? Can Sherlock actually deduct the answer to this mystery from horse tracks, a dead man's bad breath, and a plain wedding band? You're goddamn right, he can!So...WhoDoneIt?Now, I'm fully prepared to admit that I had forgotten about the Mormon Connection. I haven't read this one years, mostly because I prefer the short stories. Duh!But, to uncover the reasons behind the killings, Doyle takes us on a journey to the wilds of America! Specifically, Utah.Land of the Magic Underwear!This was where the tale of one man's thirst for vengeance was born. And it's all Brigham Young's fault. He was eeeeeeevil!
  Bwahahahahaha!
I'm assuming that Mormonism (like most religions) has its share of shady skeleton's in the closet. Now, I don't claim to be an expert on these guys. And I don't personally know very many Mormons, due to their predilection for Salt Lake City. All I know about that religion is what I've seen on tv or read in books, and it's not much.They wear special underwear. They can't watch R-rated movies. And they used to go door-to-door, until the Jehovah's Witness got to be too much competition.There's something else I'm forgetting though... What is it? It's right there on the tip of my tongue. Is it that they write best selling novels about sparkly vampires? No, there was something that looked like a big pink elephant...Oh! I remember!Yes. Well, from what I can tell, the only Mormons who practice polygamy now are fringe groups that are more or less shunned by their peers. And while I'm not on board with any religion, I doubt that this one is much weirder than most, at this point anyway. Plus, at least most Mormons seem to be pretty educated and well-off. It's not like Salt Lake City is one huge trailer park filled with toothless hillbillies. And (bonus!) they seem to have the sense to keep their crazy old people off the airwaves...Or so I thought! Now that I've read this, I'm going to have to rethink my plan to move west! Who knew these guys were so devious!?Kidnapping, forced marriage, murder, and secret bird calls!?  Was this really a five star book?Fuck, no. But it's my favorite character's first book, and I enjoyed the hell out of it.Buddy read with my Non-Crunchy Friends!",267,275

102868,A Study in Scarlet,emma,"1,781",42700,4,"November 26, 2020","Who's the better detective: Sherlock Holmes, or me when I'm trying to figure out someone's entire moral compass based solely on who they're following on Instagram?Like, sure, Holmesy might use the power of observation more effectively than any other fictional detective in history, but does he even know which usernames are red flags?Doubtful.This is one of the better mysteries, like, ever, but in terms of pacing it still manages to be a total nightmare. Stopping the entire narrative at the climax in order to inexplicably launch into a bone-dry description of Mormonism for seemingly 800 pages...brave. Bold. Unparalleled.(I actually Wikipedia'd this book to make sure something wasn't wrong with the ebook I borrowed from the library. That's how much of a mindf*ck that switch-up was.)Still, though, Sherlock Holmes rules and is very fun to read about, even if I have some association of his name with Benedict Cumberbatch and therefore have to occasionally feel fear strike my very heart when I think of his face while reading.We take the wins with the losses in this life.Similarly, I was browsing in a used bookstore recently and a cute boy started chatting me up about Sherlock Holmes, and then when I left to buy my book and a coffee he didn't chase me across the store / fall in love with me / hold a boombox playing In Your Eyes over his head.Mixed history, really.Bottom line: More Holmes, please!",179,9

102868,A Study in Scarlet,Henry Avila,446,3219,4,"August 20, 2020","This nifty novel ( really a novella) the first Sherlock Holmes book written in 1887, is rather strange since it is set both in the culture, of brimming Victorian London, 1881, and the  dry , very hot desolate deserts of the savage wastelands of Utah, 1847 , nothing here...before there was a state established there or giving that name. Or even part of the United States, since technically still Mexican territory , neglected by them and ruled by the Ute Indians... hence the appropriate appellation . The almost forgotten war between the U.S. and Mexico...1846-1848 caused the maps of the world, to alter significantly the long borders between these two giant but rather sparsely populated, combating nations...Changed the status , the news surprised the Mormons who had fled persecution , seeking freedom, for their weird belief in polygamy (which men loved) but caused momentous trouble , in the American Midwest. Angry crowds killed many Mormons, including their founder , Joseph Smith, and escape was now impossible they thought...except this harsh, distant place from 19th century civilization, made them almost completely sovereign... The plot begins when the new Mormon prophet Brigham Young, soon to have 55 wives, leading the first 2,ooo Mormons to the promise land, an exodus of 1,300 miles ... his men, find two pathetic, starving people , a man and a girl child the only survivors of a lost wagon train, sleeping on a hill overlooking the wilderness ... an account about love , a forced marriage and revenge ... endlessly sought ... is revealed...Back to Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson ( pardon the history lesson but it is quite important for understanding this great book ). The actual narrative starts with young Dr. John Watson returning from the horrendous second British- Afghan war ...sadly there will be many more...Wounded, nearly fatally, then let go from the army , trying to recover his health and spirits , save money too, he rents a room at 221 b Baker street ...this is where the famous duo become friends, the reserved Holmes fascinates the good doctor with his many little shall we say eccentricities...what does he do to make a living. Obviously exceptionally brilliant but keeps to himself. NOT a medical man, yet knows much about medicine...interested in discussing grisly crime cases, the bloodier the better, an unusual obsession...why? Then Scotland Yard contacts Holmes , asking for help with a murder investigation...a mystery that only the violinist Sherlock can resolve, with an assist from the Baker street irregulars, nevertheless will not get credit for... The very different stories , unite masterfully at last , in the rather faraway England...Americans in London start being killed for no apparent reason... not political or for profit either, and all came from Salt Lake City...This will give readers a nice taste ...and why Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes is still popular today.",139,4

  The Game is on!

  ENTER THE DETECTIVE
It's in this very first novel where the great character Sherlock Holmes, along with Dr. John Watson, are introduced to the audience in their first case together.It wasn't an instantenous success, but gladly it was appreciated soon enough to the point that when the author, Sir Arhur Conan Doyle, wanted to ""kill"" the character, not only their loyal fans wrote letters against the decision (something unheard at those times) for not saying that even people in London were seeing wearing mourning black bands showing respect to the ""death"" of the character, that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle finally ""resurrect"" the character writing even more adventures.But everything began here......Dr. John Watson got injured in war, and when he got back to London, he isn't able to afford a decent apartment on his scarse pension, so he is introduced to a peculiar man who is a ""consultant detective"", the first and only in the world, that not only private detectives consulted him but even the very Scotland Yard was resigned that Holmes' help was needed, for not saying crucial to solve impossible crimes.While this case, maybe wasn't that astounding, it is quite astonishing at the speed that Holmes is able to solve it, thanks to his uncanning deduction skills.I think that the middle section where the culprit explained his background and the reasons to commit the murders, could be exposed in a less extended way, but still, it was the first story, so I am able to forgive this kinda of a deviation of the main storyline.In this first novel, you met along with Holmes and Watson, also the Detective Inspector Lestrade, and the Baker Street Irregulars (which are vital for the search for people and clues to Holmes).A literary legend was born here.",124,14

    “There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror”
  
I’m going to keep this short and (somewhat) sweet, because this is a very short little introduction that started it all. Everyone’s favorite original detective is Sherlock Holmes, and I’ve been wanting to see how it all began for a long while now! But I can honestly say that I was not prepared for the last half of this tiny book. Yet, I am still happy that I can finally say I’ve read the source material. ➽ PART ONE:We get to learn a little background information on Watson, and we get to see how he and Sherlock met and developed the most unusual of friendships. I really loved this and I feel like the story benefits so heavily from being told in Watson’s perspective. And I loved seeing the Baker Street apartment and I loved the mysteries, too.➽ PART TWO:What the fuck even was this last half? Utah? Mormons and polygamy? Questionable child care? Gross words describing Native people? What the hell did I stumble into? But I guess we needed to know the murderer from part one's back story? I am so damn confused, but yikes. Overall, this was a wild ride, but I am happy that I went on it. I’m not sure if I will be continuing on with anything else from Arthur Conan Doyle, but I can’t wait to jump into a reimagining, A Study in Charlotte, and see all of the parallels! Especially since this original material left me feeling very underwhelmed. Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Tumblr | Youtube | TwitchI read this for #CatchUpOnClassics!",105,5

So having just finished this book, I am seriously considering upping my rating to 5 stars. I had forgotten how good it was, even the bit that I had previously found rather boring,  the background part giving details of why the crime was committed .So I shall have to give serious thought over the next few days as to whether the wonderful scenes of the first encounters between Holmes and Watson, and the investigation into the ""Study in Scarlet"", warrant an upgrade to 5 stars. January 2016 4 stars ⭐️Having recently read some of ACD's Challenger books I was well used to and at ease with the writing style, and it felt like coming home to a cosy room. I have read a Study in Scarlet before, many years ago, but remembered little of it, now I realise it was certainly the weakest of the novels, given that half of it is background after the event. Having said that it was enjoyable, and brought me back into the Holmes fold, where I haven't been for many a year. It re-reminded me that in my opinion Jeremy Brett is THE archetypal Holmes actor. I see his face and mannerisms as I read, or was he just so good in dedicating the remainder of his acting career and life to Holmes that his interpretation is just so accurate.

    An anti-review
  
I don’t read reviews of books, of which I am damn sure I will be reading it very soon. Now, I don’t know how this habit affects my reading.So, what happened was..I was not aware of the fact that “I had to be surprised when the second part of the book starts and wonder what happened to the story with Sherlock Holmes in it and how that mystery was solved! Moreover, I had to wonder whether the second part was from some other book, somehow got binded in my copy and curse the publishers”. I was not surprised and neither did I curse the publishers.As I was ill-prepared for reading, this resulted in me being not disappointed like I was supposed to be.I was not aware of the fact that “I had to loathe the second part because it didn’t have Sherlock Holmes but instead Mormons and whatnots”. I couldn't loathe it because it was equally good.I was even not aware of the fact that “I had to drop my jaw when Sherlock Holmes says ‘Gentleman, let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of...’”. But I did, so atleast I got some expression right.You see, I was not aware of such shortcomings and issues so I enjoyed it a bit more than I should have. It’s a promise that I will hate the second part and enjoy it less on my re-read. And I mean no...
  Earlier...
Okay, what the hell am I going to write for this review without writing spoilers, because everything turns out to be a spoiler.Damn! This is hard.I don’t know what to include and what not to include!Maybe, I should include this line, for this is best:
  I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order.

Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.
 No, I should not, since almost every reviewer has used this line. So I am not going to write it in my review too and lengthen it unnecessarily, I will skip this.This is going to be damn hard, I can't find a single thing to write about.And what should I write about Sherlock Holmes?Kemper wrote: “Sherlock Holmes is a dick.” and got bunch of votes. I should also write something like that.Like, Sherlock Holmes is douchebag. Nah! that doesn’t sound nice and that is not correct either.I don’t want to write about the same issue of disjointed second part being a problem and this part being boring too, I didn’t felt so. But almost every review says same thing.I can’t think of anything to write. I should probably skip this one and write review of Cosmicomics, I need to edit that ‘FUCKING MINDFUCK’ I have left over there.No, I must write something!Maybe, I should review others' reviews and in this process the book will also be reviewed. This sounds like good idea, but may be offensive. So I should mention in my review at last that:I mean no harmdisrespect, I just happen to love Sherlock Holmes.",96,30
