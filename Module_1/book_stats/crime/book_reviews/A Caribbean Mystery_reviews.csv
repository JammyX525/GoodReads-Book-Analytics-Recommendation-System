31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Brina,873,4,4,"July 21, 2017","Since I was a kid reading Nancy Drew or the Hardy Boys, I have read mysteries in between other books as a palette cleanser. Rather than go into a reading slump, I read a fast paced crime or detective story to clear my head. There is no detective writer I enjoy more than the Queen of Crime herself, Dame Agatha Christie. I joined the Goodreads group reading the detectives when I found out that they would be reading one Miss Marple case a month for a year. Although I had been a fan of Hercule Poirot first, I jumped at the opportunity to read more books by Christie. A Caribbean Mystery, Miss Marple's tenth case, is the upcoming group selection. An older Miss Marple has been gifted a Caribbean vacation to the island of St Honore by her wealthy nephew Raymond West. With her getting on in years, he desires that she spend at least part of the winter away from the dreary climate of St Mary Mead. One who is more than willing to try new things even as she ages, Miss Marple agrees to spend time at a beach front hotel. Appearing as a feeble old lady with a knack for knitting, Miss Marple is the delight of the hotel guests. Yet, her mind is anything but flighty, and, just as it seems to do in St Mary Mead, murder cases fall into Miss Marple's lap. Colonel Palgrave is also vacationing on St Honore. Regaling the other guests with his tales of safari and the spoils of war, he is the life of the island, even if his stories are on the boring side. While telling Miss Marple the story about meeting a murderer in the eye, Colonel Palgrave literally believes he has seen a criminal from a previous experience. Sure enough, the next day he turns up murdered, followed closely by a local hotel worker named Victoria. Guests start to panic and some flee, leaving Miss Marple to sharpen her detecting skills. As in the cases in St Mary Mead, the police appear less than competent. It is up to Miss Marple to unravel the clues to this case, along with the help of fellow guest Mr Rafiel. Together, the two octogenarians come up with motives and alibis for all the hotel guests and workers before another murder occurs on hotel grounds. All this takes place while Miss Marple is supposed to be on vacation, yet, as she has confided in at least one person in each case that I have read, murder seems to find her. As in the case at St Mary Mead, Miss Marple lets the case take place in front of her only to come up with a simple solution at the end. While Hercule Poirot is still my favorite of Agatha Christie's detectives, Miss Marple is starting to grow on me. Whereas Poirot entreaties people to employ their little grey cells and usually knows whodunit it at the beginning, Miss Marple uses deductive reasoning to systematically come up with the criminal and motive by the case's close. Miss Marple's cases take less brain power and are perfect for my palette cleansers. I always enjoy reading Agatha Christie's mysteries, and A Caribbean Mystery was no exception. I look forward to the next time that I sit down with one of her cases, and rate this easy reading mystery 3.5 stars. ",147,20
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Henry Avila,446,3219,3,"February 16, 2021","Jane Marple is very grateful to her loving nephew Raymond West, a popular novelist and rich man, who paid for his aunt's vacation (she recently recovered from an illness ) .

31300,A Caribbean Mystery,carol.,"1,501",7544,3,"February 7, 2017","One's time period can be such a bother, don't you think? Or, in some cases, very inspiring. I, for instance, never thought I'd see the time when a Cheeto could become president. I mean, president of the Frito-Lay Corporation, sure. But an elected position? A victory for processed foods! Out with the vegetable gardens, in with the snack machines! Wait, not that kind of orange finger food? Oh. Oh, well... nevermind. Back to what I was saying about inspiration. I mean, hey--I'm in my forties. I actually had a grandmother who referred to black Americans as 'coloreds.' Think about the sea of societal change iin this time period, from the court case upholding desegregating schools in 1954 (way to go, independent Justice Branch!) to an actual African-American President of the U.S. in 2008. That's pretty amazing. Sometimes I think I'm in the right epoch, and other times I don't. I mean, processed snack foods--gross.Take Agatha Christie's A Caribbean Mystery, for instance. If only we could have left a bunch of her era's prejudices and populist ideas out of the book, it'd be much more tolerable. Did we need to have the social commentary on the marriage and procreative habits of the islanders? Not necessary to the plot in the least, and yet it gets mentioned a number of times, at least four or five, I should think. Along with the weird psychoanalysis of women in general. Thank goodness we're modern enough at this point to have a discussion about sex versus love, as well as treat adultery as not that shocking. Skip those retro bits and you have a delightful mystery in a beautiful setting, although one can't help wish--just a little bit, says Miss Marple--for some actual English weather (not me, though. I can totally not wish for English weather).Dear Raymond has sent Miss Marble on an island vacation, to rest her rheumatism and test her skills. Not long after Major is telling her a story about a murderer, he himself it found dead. Mon dieu! Wait, wrong character. But Miss Marple is too genteel to use exclamatory phrases. It's a gentle kind of narrative at first, where Miss Marple looks back on life, human nature, the challenges of aging, and picks apart the relationships of the other guests at the resort. Surprising to me were the short bits that included a third-person perspective of another couple of characters. It was obvious Christie was using it to build suspense and as a red herring, but I was a bit surprised to note such a cheap trick. Ah well.It really was a fun little story, with some interesting twists and a multiple body count to keep the reader in a state of fear. The resort proved to be a typical Christie setting of the isolated manor house/guests, leading to a limited pool of suspects. This one, I remembered reading before, so I can't say whether it surprised. But I enjoyed it and polished it off quickly.",85,13
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,PorshaJo,435,655,4,"May 1, 2021","I've always been a fan of Agatha Christie. A few years ago shopping a library book sale I came across this one. I thought....ooohhhh a murder mystery in caribbean, sounds exotic. I purchased it and thought a perfect read for my upcoming trip to the islands. And I continued to drag it with me on a number of trips, never to be read. Finally, while sitting at home in the frosty weather I thought it's the perfect time to pick it up.Miss Marple is sent away to vacation in the sun of the islands by her nephew. Oh it's so glamorous that all the patrons of the small charming hotel get together on the veranda for drinks of gin before dinner nightly, dressed in their best evening wares. Of course there is none other than Major Palgrave, who is quite the bore with his tediously, long, and boring stories he continues to tell everyone. Even the one where he tells of the murderer he's met. He even has a picture. But soon Major Plagrave tells that story one too many times and finds himself dead, from an unknown medical condition. Naturally Miss Marple is on the case, knowing it was murder and not a medical condition. As she begins to question the guests, it appears another murder takes place, and then........Well, I'll not give anything away. I will say I really enjoyed this one. While I'm more of a Pirot girl, I still enjoy a Marple story. She doesn't appear as a nosy, busy body, but a sharp cookie who knows how to blend. And what I enjoyed most in this story is Miss Marple and old man Mr. Rafiel who thoroughly discussed the murder...eh murders and all the guests trying to determine whodunnit. Mr. Rafiel was quite the curmudgeon but the two made a fun, interesting, and quirky pair. Why a 4 only, well, even I was able to figure out the murder in the case after some time. But it was a fun read till the end. I'm so glad I picked this one up finally and looking forward to my next Christie adventure.",62,18
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Anne,"3,785",6900,3,"February 21, 2022","3.5 starsThe magical Miss Marple does it again!Only this time she does it on a tropical vacation. Unlike quite a few of the Marple mysteries, this one features everyone's favorite little old spinster. I personally just love the way her inner mind works. So proper and sweet...but not really. The cast of characters was great, too.You have a whole slew of people on the island who range from (supposedly) lovely to (supposedly) despicable and you can't wait to see who's going to end up getting killed off next!Or maybe that's just me?Nah. This one was another solid story, and even though it won't go down as one of my tippy-top Christie favorites, I quite enjoyed it.Joan Hickson was the narrator of the audiobook version that I listened to and she did a very good job. I will say that I thought she was quite good with all the different accents except the ones that were supposed to be Hispanic. For whatever reason, the two characters I remember sounded less Spanish-y and more like they had a lisp. Although, that could just be the way I was hearing it.",49,2
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Adrian,538,194,4,"January 17, 2020","DRAMATISATION LISTENED TO IN 2020Firstly let's say it's a shame that this does not have a separate entry as it is not the audiobook of the novel, it is an abridged dramatisation starring June Whitfield as Miss Marple. Whilst I cannot imagine her as Miss Marple in a TV version, she is too, well I don't know but she's too something. That said her voice is excellent and so are these BBC dramatisations.Well adapted, but obviously quite abridged, this is an enjoyable listen especially when decorating ha ha.MARPLE GROUP READ IN 2017Another excellent Miss Marple book, and although I have seen the Joan Hickson TV adaptation, I cannot remember ever having read the book. I really enjoyed it and liked the introduction of Mr Rafiel, who I know we will see later.I'm really enjoying this whole challenge and we still have a good few to go.",44,N/A

31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Susan,"2,574",601,4,"July 18, 2017","This mystery sees Miss Marple relocated from her usual setting, of villages and vicarages, and deposited on a Caribbean holiday by nephew Raymond. The preceding winter had seen Miss Marple suffering from pneumonia and, with sunshine advised to aid her recovery, she is treated to a stay at the Golden Palm Hotel in St Honore, Trinidad. The hotel has been taking over by a young couple, Molly and Tim Kendal, who are keen to keep returning guests happy and ‘make a go’ of it. Among the guests are the wealthy Mr Rafiel, attended by assistant Esther Waters and valet/masseur Arthur Jackson, Canon Prescott and his sister, Dr Graham, Major Palgrave and two married couples – Colonel Edward Hillingdon and wife, Evelyn, and Greg and Lucky Dyson. Major Palgrave is the type of elderly man who loves to tell stories about his past and Miss Marple is listening to him one day when he tells her about a murderer and, shortly afterwards, he is found dead…Truth be told, Miss Marple has been finding her Caribbean holiday slightly monotonous, even without Major Palgrave’s interminable tales. When there are more odd happenings on the island, Miss Marple teams up with Mr Rafiel to investigate. This is an enjoyable mystery, although it is not one of Christie’s best plots and Miss Marple suffers from a lack of her usual sounding boards and cast of village characters. If you enjoy this, Mr Rafiel is mentioned in a further mystery, “Nemesis.”",33,7
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Piyangie,504,360,3,"July 13, 2021","This is one of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries set outside England. She takes us to the Caribbean with Miss Marple coming on holiday there. Whatever Miss Marple does, murder seems to follow her. :) And we get to enjoy another murder mystery. Here is an instance where the initiation and carrying out the investigation is done by Miss Marple alone. A first death occurs and is believed to have arisen from natural causes. Only, Miss Marple is not so sure. When a second death occurs however, Miss Marple is certain that a murderer is lurking among them. In the absence of a ""proper"" police procedure, Miss Marple decides to act herself to unravel the wolf in the sheep's skin with the assistance of an eccentric invalid. While the actions of Miss Marple were entertaining, the story was poorly predictable. From the beginning, it isn't difficult to understand the pattern of the story. And by the middle of it, I knew who it was and why he'd done it. I had only to wait till the official revelation. And there was no longer any suspense. But I still liked the chatty dialogues and the intrigues of the characters. :) Even though it didn't attract fully as a murder mystery, it still held my interest quite in other directions. I only wish that Christie has taken some effort to create the holiday ambiance and the tropical setting of the Caribbean. On the whole, it is certainly not one of the best in the Marple series, but not a bad one either.",32,N/A
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Veronique,"1,217",164,4,"July 4, 2022","Re-read Let’s face it, I shall re-read her to my dying days ;O)“It's all very well to talk like that,” said Mr. Rafiel. “We, you say? What do you think I can do about it? I can't even walk without help. How can you and I set about preventing a murder? You're about a hundred and I'm a broken-up old crock.” Humour is probably not something people associate with Agatha Christie but she did have plenty of it, and used it usually when portraying silly and arrogant people. A Caribbean Mystery sees our lovely Ms Marple in the West Indies, where nothing seems to happen when compared to St Mary's Mead, until of course there is a murder, and everyone is a potential suspect. Many red herrings take us on a variety of paths, but this time a clue is given near the beginning, which will allow some readers to actually find out who the murderer by the end is. That is if you don't let yourself be lead all over the place by our manipulative author.I guess that Robert Thorogood, creator of Death In Paradise tv series and novels, had this book in mind :O)",24,2

A blowhard dies of natural causes, but Miss Marple is struck by the timing: blowhard claimed to have seen a murderer a day earlier.

31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Constantine,783,120,3,"January 14, 2023","Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ ½Genre: Mystery + Classic""A Caribbean Mystery"" is a famous classic Agatha Christie mystery novel, featuring the beloved Miss Marple. This is the tenth book in the Marple series. The story is set on the fictional Caribbean island of Saint Honore, where Miss Marple is vacationing at a luxury hotel. However, her peaceful holiday is interrupted when Major Palgrave is murdered in his hotel room, and the investigation that follows has a number of suspects, including a shady businessman, a resentful former employee, and even a family member with a motive for murder.Throughout the course of the book, Miss Marple works with the local police to solve the mystery of Major Palgrave's murder. At the end of the book, a shocking and gratifying denouement reveals the name of the person who committed the crime. The storyline is highly captivating, and the author maintains an appealing atmosphere that is appropriate to the setting of the mystery that is being unraveled. In most of the books in the Miss Marple series, there is at least one other intriguing character to whom the author assigns humorous qualities. In this tale, Mr. Jason Rafiel is an elderly gentleman, and the conversation that he had with Miss Marple was one of my favorites. Both of the characters have a strong and interesting rapport with one another.Although I cannot claim that this was my favorite Christie novel, it is certainly one of the more entertaining ones due to the fact that it is well-written and the mystery is engaging. However, the fact that you have to keep track of a large cast of individuals, particularly in the beginning, is the only potential negative that I can think of. If you give it some serious thought and are familiar with Christie's other works and her style of writing, you might be able to guess the surprise that comes at the very end.",21,3
31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Ken,"2,111",1315,3,"August 24, 2021","A Miss Marple holiday special!Our favourite elderly spinster soon finds herself embroiled in another mystery whilst resting on holiday.The trip was her nephews idea as the cold weather in St Mary's Mead has been effecting her health, it's there that she meets Major Palgrave who has plenty of stories to share.Inevitably with Jane Marple the topic of murder arises and Palgrave had intended to show her a picture of someone who he believes has got away with murder on more than one occasion, only to change his mind.When Palgrave turns up dead the following day, Jane instantly knows it was murder and everyone on the island soon becames a suspect.I'll confess that I had some trepidation knowing where this story was set, there were definitely some stuck in its time elements. I actually felt more disappointed that Christie didn't really transport me to that part of the world as effectively as some of her other novels.Though I guess everything being set within a resort added to the stakes.The mystery itself felt like a return to form for a later day Christie and while all the clues were presented fairly I was still baffled by the 'whodunit' for the majority of the story.",20,2

31300,A Caribbean Mystery,Simona B,882,2949,3,"May 15, 2017","“She had one weapon and one weapon only, and that was conversation.”It fell rather flat in comparison to other Christie's works, but 1) you can't really blame Miss Marple for not being Hercule Poirot and 2) you can't really blame anyone for not being Hercule Poirot. They try, they do, but it's not their fault if they fail. The same goes for the characters/suspects. I don't know, it's as if Miss Marple makes everything duller, and Poirot everything shinier. I can't help feeling this difference and it's not my fault either. But Mr. Rafiel was everything. A couple of decades younger, and I'd have wanted him to propose to Miss Marple. Scratch that, I wanted him to propose and that's it. Their banter was cute and fun, and definitely unexpected. “If you knew what you looked like that night with that fluffy pink wool all round your head, standing there and saying you were Nemesis! I'll never forget it!”",19,2
